if you were to search where is the oldest 
Chinatown in the world well the answer is  
right here in Manila in the Philippines 
in this video we're going to be exploring  
this Chinatown which goes way back to 
the 1500s and one thing Chinatown does  
insanely well is the fields over the course 
of today's video we're going to be trying the  
best Chinese Filipino Street field that 
this area of Manila has to offer [Music]
right so Chinatown is located in an area called 
banondo and given that it is the oldest Chinatown  
in the world we decided to dig a little bit 
deeper just into finding out exactly how it  
all came about so yes the gist basically you may 
or may not know that the Philippines was actually  
ruled by Spain for about 300 years but before 
the Spanish had come here there was a Chinese  
Community already in Manila yeah when the Spanish 
took over they did want to move the Chinese into a  
separate area to where they were they didn't 
want to get rid of them completely because  
they did want to do some trade and things like 
that however they did not really trust them too  
much so they wanted to really put them in just 
one area of the city that area now is Bernardo  
so like I said this goes back to the 1500s 
which makes this the world's oldest Chinatown
okay yeah so because we're newbies to Manila 
and to Chinatown and to streetfield in this  
place in general yeah we did do a little bit of 
research to kind of find out the best fields for  
Troy uh also location wise which really helps 
me I'm just walking around kind of aimlessly so  
we have a few bits on our list that we're going 
to try and pick up and we're just going to stop  
number one right now oh people are just sitting 
around I don't think this is the queue really
all right so our first doll uh to try some food 
we did a little bit of research online and one of  
the popular fields to try is dumplings and me 
and Keelan absolutely love them we tried some  
when we were in Poland as well they're called 
pierogies they never go wrong with dumpling so  
there's a bestseller here and I believe it's the 
pork and chive one so it's obviously popular as  
well as you can see buy the queue of people 
it's just Where We Are I don't know so yeah
can we order some dumplings yeah what ways 
does it work do you do any vegetarians no  
vegetarians okay for this one you're doing 
this one and what what portions do they come  
in fourth you have to get 14 pieces okay am 
I going to E4 exam yeah can I get 14 pieces
it's actually a little bit of a Mad sort of setup 
because it's like a little slowing down to smoke a  
head in and then you give your order and so it's 
like a hole in the wall to a restaurant you can  
actually see them inside as well cooking them so 
all the food is going to be fresh but yeah we did  
have a little look at the menu and there was kind 
of a it was predominantly neat dumplings anyway so  
well as Samantha said we have plenty of food to 
Troy here so I'm sure I'll get something right  
so we just ordered and unfortunately Keelan can't 
try anything they've no vegetarian foods so yeah  
the dumplings they do is pork and chive they 
don't do any vegetarian months so uh you said  
there was a bit of a cute in his popular but the 
way it works is people are just hanging around  
waiting on their order so they give you a number 
I think they just called number seven there so we  
shouldn't be too long waiting we're number 10 and 
it was 200 peso and you can only buy the minimum  
you can buy them in is 40 and so you're gonna have 
to eat them all by yourself I don't know if I'll  
get you to 14 because we do have a lot of build 
planned to try today so we'll see how I get on
thank you very much thank you bye
oh my God look at them look at them
oh they smell really good right so taste test 
I presume we're just gonna eat the whole thing
oh well they taste as nice as they look 
they are gorgeous honestly I probably  
will eat the whole lot they're so nice as I 
said there's the pork and chives inside them  
and you can really taste it and then the 
soy sauce just gives them that extra bit  
of flavor also the actual dumpling itself is 
so soft it literally just melts in your mouth
on to our next spot all right so we're in China 
Town and it's hectic honestly it's so busy now  
we did read up I don't know if there's any right 
time of the day to come up it's supposed to be all  
day it's just going to be busy there is a great 
atmosphere and vibe to the place we're looking  
we can see all the lanterns and all the Chinese 
writing around so yeah a Chinatown inner city is  
always a really cool place to explore well you'll 
definitely know you're in Chinatown because you  
start to see all these kind of red and yellow 
dragons everywhere and also very suspect Warren
so our next Food of the day that we looked up and 
we have to try is a thing called lumpia if I'm  
saying it right and they're basically like spring 
rolls so I'm just reading here it says it's like a  
crepe pastry the pastry is supposed to be really 
kin and then they're filled with vegetables are  
meat so I'm not too sure what meat yet we just 
asked the girl right style here unfortunately  
again for Caitlin they don't do any vegetarian 
ones so it's gonna be me again just trying it  
but yeah they look really really good it 
looks like a glad spring roll they do yeah  
and even look in here and I absolutely love 
spring rolls it's one of my favorite foods  
honestly you can never go wrong with a spring 
roll so uh yeah I'm gonna order one to try  
pesos 95 95 and it's ready and all right okay 
and it actually smells like a spring roll
thank you very much
95 peso so what's that it's like a Euro just 
a little bit over a Euro maybe really good and  
again cash all the time which we know from 
traveling around in any of the street food  
markets always bring cash right so it comes in 
a little box and it has like a little stamp on  
it with the name of the shop whoever you ordered 
from I've been a good Brandon yeah so let's open  
it and see what's inside oh look at that it 
really does look like a spring roll it's more  
like a wrap doesn't it or maybe actually know 
that you say it it does have that spring roll  
type of texture but it's not as crispy crispy 
no it's not as crispy it's actually soft like  
a wrap okay and again then you get the little soya 
sauce just for flavor soy sauce feast taste tests
oh that was lovely look at the inside so I can 
taste carrot really strong and I can actually  
see the carrot inside as well and cabbage and 
then I think the meat inside I asked the girl  
is chicken and pork a mixture of oats and 
it's really really tasty does remind me of  
a spring roll but it's like a spring roll and 
a wrap rather than the crispy outer layer of  
a spring roll it's really really good it tastes 
very healthy I'm just looking here although the  
vegetables and the meat are like wrapped in 
this sort of wrapping look how tin it is like  
it's so thin so it's actually not that filling 
so yes that place was on our list of food to try  
and stuff like how we found it I don't know 
because down this tiny little Alleyway and  
there's also like kind of fruit and veg styles to 
the side and this is a very very local experience  
yeah this this little Alias was 
coming off one of the the main roads
wow wow it is just vegetables 
everywhere you can see here  
and here and we're back out onto the Main Street 
the time for our next stop of the day and I'm  
gonna ask the girl how we're pronouncing 
because I think I'm going to say it wrong
called
how do I change
the fried Chappelle I still don't know if I'm 
saying it right she has her mask on it's hard  
to understand but prior to power I think 
and there's marinated pork inside it and I  
think this is like a famous Filipino sort of 
snack on the go so I'm dying to try it here
thank you very much Quick Service 35 peso 
so what's that God that's like 50 cents  
or something right so my fried chicken it's 
actually quite small so I probably would have  
ate like more but that was just from a little 
corner shop it's called fried Chappelle and  
they seem like a popular spot there's like 
a crowd there so anyway yeah they're the  
Filipino version of a Chinese steamed bun and 
they're made with a homemade rice flour dough  
and they're stuffed with some Savory pork inside 
so yeah I am really excited to dig into this and  
again a no go for Keelan because it's pork 
inside I'm wasting away behind this camera
oh wow honestly that's amazing is it good look at 
the inside you can see all the pork on the inside  
so I had asked the girl and I said like is 
there a sauce but then she said the pork is  
actually marinated already in a sauce before 
it's cooked or put into the bread then the  
bread is really really soft and doughy it's 
absolutely gorgeous honestly it's so nice
I'm trying to get more pork and your 
first bite is always like a bit bread
the park is always in the 
middle of it oh it's gorgeous
probably one of the nicest snacks I've ever 
tried honestly I can see why the Filipinos  
love it and it is a popular snack don't judge 
me but I am going to go and get another one
slim pickings for me lads
oh hold on a minute I've struck the jackpot
hello yeah one celery please
see they're very very popular 
Spa lots of people around too
foreign
people they're making so many and like they're 
all just ready to go then yeah so they close  
as I said at six o'clock so obviously people 
are coming before what time is it now it's  
like 10 past five but still a bit of time 
they're so nice you have to try this if  
you're in the Philippines red you can smell 
cinnamon if you think it's coming from here
hello hey
cinnamon um
we're getting this off the smell 
we don't even know what it is
okay so can we get two um
[Music] this is a total stab in the dark 
here I think God doesn't really speak  
great English I don't speak any Filipino 
this is basically a porches on smell alone
thank you thank you bye okay so we got loads 
for that I don't know I think the price was  
like four peso for one for one baby this is what 
we were smelling it smells really good there's a  
cinnamon smell of them well it's not cinnamon I 
guess they're like little little piece of dough  
or something ready sometimes you know they're 
piping hot headache they smell amazing honestly  
let's actually check the name of it sorry on 
the Sun is that how you say it I don't know
maybe people can help us
okay the long guy I think is how you say 
it not too sure but Hannah we better try  
them and see what they're like they're like 
in I like little dough balls or something
sorry are they nice yeah 
they're like they're playing
it's like a fresh dough or bread or something 
like that has a little bit of seasoning on the  
top of it that's very nice honestly it's really 
nice lovely I'd like to make some with a better  
maybe dipped into a bit of soup yeah I think 
the more of a sweet bread you got that no I  
think we'd probably better with like peanut butter 
or something like that would it maybe you have to  
know that you're saying yeah anyway four pesos 
oh God all this walking is starting to take its  
towel a little bit so we're gonna need to get 
some refreshments get a drink or something to  
try to cool us down I believe there's like 
a cafe or something up here that does uh  
some juices and things like that so it's also a 
bit manicures have to watch myself crossing the  
road but yeah we're gonna try to get a drink and 
just sort of I'm gonna chill out for a minute oh
it was really exciting absolutely there's 
a selling point for something isn't it  
featured on CNN most visited the world's oldest 
China sandwich we know already Cafe mezzanian  
so I think they have like an upstairs that 
like a last name in Florida you can say on  
right so we did say we were gonna stop 
for a drink but something else is just  
the water the infamous soup number 
four is made from Bulls testicles  
oh God no I say you're like oh God I'm a 
vegetarian you know what even if I wasn't  
a vegetarian I don't know if I'd go that 
way with balls testicles but I definitely  
won't be trying that fish I usually try 
dishes for the tea almost but not this one
oh God it's so nice to sit down it's lovely 
and the AC is lovely up here as well so  
um yeah this is like a cafe on the mezz name 
floor it's actually attached to that restaurant  
that we're reading the sign there where 
they have like that famous uh dish with it
oh my God and it's obviously a 
popular spot as well so we were  
cute in the wrong queue and we 
could actually just walk up here  
so yeah we're hanging Airways we're 
just going to order drinks together
thank you right so yeah we just stopped for 
a drink and they actually have a kill drinks  
menu like you can get some like um healthy 
drinks they have like an avocado shake melon  
like different ones you can get we're actually 
going for I thought on the menu there's an ice  
calamansi so we went for the ice one but 
it's um it's like a Filipino lemonade and  
made from some sort of lime I need 
to be really refreshing sorry oh
would you believe that um do you have like another 
like Filipino drink that you would recommend or  
I guess you have a fresh lemon  
which one fresh lemon the fresh lemon oh fresh 
lemonade is this like a Filipino drink yeah  
okay yeah buy two again and what what is 
in this uh lemon it's made with lemon okay
there you go see a can Carly the calamansi juice  
anyway the alternative was pretty good it was this 
kind of lemon lemon juice very refreshing isn't it  
it's actually lovely honestly the nicest homemade 
lemonade I've ever tried is really really fresh  
and I'm definitely having some more it is over 
here also so when we went into the little cafe  
it was starting to get there but now we're after 
coming out there was a little bit of a way to get  
here is because it is so busy in there it's really 
popular for them all the streets are a little  
flips I know yeah it's gorgeous and yeah just on 
prices those two uh lemon juices came to 190 pesos
thank you
probably now me and these ones okay so you come 
into a place called Lord's Bakery and the reason  
being is because they do these egg targets that 
are actually remind me of in Portugal they have  
these things called pastel Donatos and they're 
kind of similar I know I think these are a little  
bit more eggy but the ones in Portugal are more 
custard but they actually look very similar and  
then they're kind of got like a pastry kind of uh 
I wear a layer but I'm gonna try them and see what  
they're like they were 56 pesos each yeah they 
look great let's see if they taste great adorable
yeah they're very nice they're very similar to 
the ones in in Portugal texture is a little bit  
different like I said this one's a little 
bit more eggy but it's kind of got like a  
caramel and a Colton on the top of it and then 
like I said with the pastry it's great mix
oh they're good they really like the ones actually 
important but they are a little bit different as  
in they're more eggy yeah yeah a little bit like 
spongy or something and they're really really nice  
are these popular yes yes famous they're 
the best ones they're made fresh today
always ah lovely they taste great yes they're 
lovely right next up of the day wanky Bakery
