most chips now they said it has more air than chip
smells like chips oh this 
is not my favorite flavor
I like the red V-CUT
she is hungry already
should i have licked the cheese off? You should
we don't forget the Coca Cola
she only has water
You should always have Coca Cola if you are a Filipino
I never drink dark soda. It hurts my stomach
I preferred sparkling water
the flavored stuff
do you like it? uhuh
i like cheese though
chippy this is my favorite one of my favorite  
they have barbecue flavor
if you can't tell, I have a thing for cheese
cheese is amazing
smells good
oh wrong language
smell that
no you're cut off
hint of cardboard taste
how much this in the Philippines now?
maybe it's expensive now
the taste of it is good it's just 
corn chips are very cardboardy to me
you know how much this is in the Philippines?
probably much less than what we had to pay for
get a 12 haircut. not even
probably $10
i want carbonation
i thought you don't like it?
i don't but i want carbonation

I always buy this 
you are cute when you were a kid
I always buy this at my school in the province
the other one
he always says that. he always pretends
then he's like oh my knees so when it 
actually happens i'm not going to believe it
she is not going to believe me anymore when the time has come
right i'll take it
she is not going to believe me anymore when I have the actual ring
do you like it? not bad
so we bought a microphone because you guys can't here us

It's good
the fourth one
I think they have a different brand now
in the Philippines, it's called cheese ring
uncultured swine
the same one
it's like cheesy but a little sweet too yeah you 
know Filipinos like like sweet 
our ketchup is sweet wow you'll

it's good because it's sweet at the end but 
it's not just sweet it's got flavor to it cheers

okay healthy far this is my number one 
that was weak. she said her number one is the cheese ring

to go down to that altar altar boy

I don't know why they are not selling bigger bag of this
you know last time we went to my dad's house
i remember the first time we went to your 
dad's house we had already eaten dinner  
we went to the sushi place
his dad said come on over and we were like okay and 
then we ate like another plate full of food  
it was good my gonna lie.
there are some different kind of Filipino food.
why do you always double stack on me
it's good
her Filipino accent is improving
but she is still learning
when i first start learning you know new 
language and new culture and everything  
i feel racist for some reason when i start 
speaking the language if i don't know it fully why  
i don't know i just feel like it's wrong it's 
wrong because you're you're you feel like you  
disrespecting i feel like i'm disrespectful 
but that's not being racist it's just 
you're just very respectful towards the other 
culture you don't want to disappoint someone
this was my least favorite mostly 
just because it's corn chips
she said this is her least favorite
y'all are gonna have to explain it to me 
oh yeah comment down below 
he never explains that until you guys explain it 
and then he's like okay this is what it means
