My favorite groups are GFRIEND, f(x),
TWICE, and SNSD
Now please, play my intro
Calm my ass down, I just woke up literally
so I realized like four things just came
out at the same damn time and uh,
pretty excited, so uh, let's get into this
Let's begin, let's start this ish,
let's go
-smashes keyboard- ow

Well I heard Holiday, I didn't--I heard 
the teasers too
They really up in here, goin' like -dances-
Oh what's good girl

Okay that's really cute 
okay see I've sprayed some perfume

Milkshakes would bring--

Ooh Sooyoung ༼ʘ̚ل͜ʘ̚༽

Okay I--
-gapes again-
(The beauty of SNSD)
Okay I thought I saw--I thought
wAIT
Okay that's the uh--Tiffany
Ey don't be a creep and like watch my
videos like that
Do you even know who this is?
This is SNSD dad!
That girl, who's that?
That's uh, uh--
SNSD ᕦ(Ò_Óˇ)ᕤ
Why don't you--why don't you
stop being a creeper?
Like a little baby
A little baby?
Yeah little baby
What does the little baby mean with SNSD
what you talking about in rea--
-door closes-
Ooh they got startled
Ooh look at miss SUNNY and that's
uh, Taeyeon
Oh that was Seohyun!
I didn't realize that with pink hair--I 
thought it was--oh they both have pinkhair
oh nonono she has like a mixture
-laughs- My dad creeping in--there you go
Taeyeon--my dad creeping in kind of
startled me a bit, 'cause,
imagine someone doing like this
༼ʘ̚ل͜ʘ̚༽ who are those girls
-sighs-
Oh we gon break it down though
-coughs- I'm sorry I was about to sneeze
and then something happened
-dances-
ヾ(⌐■_■)ノ♪
So obviously it's a holiday kind of feel 
-laughs- I haven't even said anything about
the MV and music video I'm so sorry
this is a terrible reaction
Oh legs yes, give it to me s--
Laid out in glitter and shiet?
-ahem- obviously that was supposed to be
a holiday-uh-Hollywood sign but it's
"Holiday"
Okay, "Holiday"--upbeat, very upbeat
It felt like a holiday, like celebration
kind of feel
In any type of fashion y'know, getting up
with your girls, dressing up with yo girls--
actually I've had-I heard the uh, mini album
before except for Holiday and All Night
To be honest I don't even know how this
reaction turned out, uh, I think there was
a lot happening, I was tryna dress up for
them, my dad interrupting, uh, me getting
confused because I thought I saw more than
eight members
I didn't want to say it, but I thought--
that's why I was counting
I'm like, "Yo, wait hold up."
But Girls' Generation is back, next up is
All Night, that's gonna be my next video
so go look out for that and yeah,
put a comment down below what you
guys think, uh, who is your bias from 
Girls' Generation, mine is uh
it's not-okay so here's the thing about
Girls' Generation and me--I switch around
with Girls' Generation, at one point it 
was Taeyeon, it was Hyoyeon then it was
like, it went to Sunny at one point
Now I think my-kind of-I'm turning towards
uh, Seohyun? At one point it was Sooyoung
then Tiffany
So at this point I don't really know
Hope you guys enjoyed the video
