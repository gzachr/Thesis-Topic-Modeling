Hey everybody! This is Randy
Santel "Atlas" and I am hungry
and very very excited tonight
because it has been forever
since I've had delicious
Filipino food, but it's my first
time for a food challenge up in
Wausau, Wisconsin. We have lots
of people here, which is much appreciated!!
We are actually here at
Timekeeper Distillery. I do
have two drinks from them that
are not part of the challenge.
We are all here courtesy of our
friends, Ed and Marjorie.
Marjorie is from the
Philippines. They both own the
restaurant, A Taste of Manila,
which is also in conjunction
with West Side Tasty Treat.
Katina and I are up here. We're
the first two people to attempt
and help kick off their
brand new Sari Not Sorry
Filipino Food Challenge. Now,
I've only got 45 minutes to
finish everything here and it
is Sari Not Sorry - the first
"sorry" is spelt S A R I and that
basically means "variety." I
actually haven't had Filipino
food since I did that food
truck challenge down in South
Carolina a few years ago but
there is a massive mound of
Pancit here which is made with
rice noodles, a whole bunch of
healthy vegetables, with a whole bunch
of garlic on that. And then on
this plate we also have eight
of their pork lumpia - I loved
lumpia the last time I had it.
We do have two massive softball
sized scoops of their garlic
fried rice. That's going to be
yummy and then I love chicken
thighs and legs so this is
going to be awesome but I've
got three big pieces of chicken
adobo. It's all got a bunch of
sauce and more garlic on it,
along with a lot of potatoes
but I don't think this is
going to be part of the
challenge. I've got two of their
ice creams that they serve. This
one is more Filipino. It is a
mango and then this is berry.
45 minutes. If I fail, it's
going to be $45, but if I win,
I'll get my entire meal for
free. I will not get a sweet T-
shirt I don't think but I'll be
the second person with my name
and photo up on the Wall of
Fame. Let's get this challenge
start.
Alright, time to dominate and get
overall win 1033. Big thank you
to the main owners Dan and Kim
of Timekeeper Distillery and big
thank you to Ed and Marjorie
for having us up to take this
challenge. Katina's record is 15:05.
She did this drink but
didn't have any ice creams. I'm
just an idiot and I love ice
creams so I'm going to have
those but let's do it. 1, 2,
3, Boom!! Alright. We'll do a pork
lumpia to start without any
sauce. Yummy!!
I thought these were going to
take longer to eat.
The lumpia and the Pancit are the
two big sellers for A Taste of
Manila and I know why - both are
amazing! There rice noodles and all
the healthy vegetables are
awesome.
Lumpia is a little different
than egg rolls and stuff.
There's no noodles in this - just
lots of healthy vegetables and
then lots of minced (I think)
pork.
Alright, courtesy of Timekeeper
Distillery, we've got this old
fashioned with bourbon. I've
got a Bar Cart which is a
canned cocktail. It's got gin.
It's called the Bee's Knees
because it's got honey and lots
of other deliciousness so I'm
going to sip this first. Okay,
I don't have a lot of gin but I
would drink this a lot more
than I do. This is awesome and
it's gluten free.
I haven't had a big spoon in a
video in forever. It's time to
use it.
These do not need sauce. These
Lumpia are so good. I'm getting
my healthy greens. I'm going to
have some of this ice cream.
it's just staring at me. It
looks delicious but mango is
the more Filipino option so I'm
going to go with that. I'm
actually going to finish this.
If you didn't know this, this
is cold like Wisconsin.
Wisconsin is cold.
I'm really glad I stopped and
ate that. That was yummy. Let's
do some cocktails. Alright,
let's have some of this Adobo
Chicken.
I used to rotisserie a lot.
This is better than what I used
to cook back when I did.
Alright, potato time.
That is really good with all
this food.
I don't think I'm going to beat
Katina's record so good job to
her but we have a lot of rice.
Let's start on this first one.
It's been a couple of years
since I've been to the
Philippines. After eating all
this food, I want to go back.
Alright done with the Bee's
Knees. that was yummy - we'll have
the old fashioned later.
We've got another chicken thigh
which is great. Let's do it.
My goal for 2022 is to finally
do a 10-pound challenge and
win. I wish I could do a
10-pound pancit challenge. That
was amazing or 10 pounds of
lumpia - I would try that too or
10 pounds of anything Katina
cooks.
Awwww
19:50 in. We'll do this other
softball sized thing of garlic
fried rice, amazing.
I should not have done that.
Alright I'm going to do the ice
cream first. We already did the
mango float ice cream - delicious!
This is a berry. The other was
more Filipino with the mango
but I think I might choose this
one. This is amazing. And it's
berry so it's loaded with
antioxidants.
I do want to preface - the ice
creams not really part of the
challenge. I'm a professional so
I'm trying to do more done with
the ice cream. Another healthy
piece of fruit and another. I feel like
DJ Khaled.
I'm all about moderation. I
don't chug. I am a beer guy.
You guys all know that but that
cocktail in the can was
delicious. This is great too.
Alright. Naz dravi.
Not done yet. I didn't know
there's - is this a tomato? What
is it? Okay, it's a cherry.
Stop it. Tomatoes are fruit
too. OMG. That was a cherry.
Alright, done with the rest.
I do not even know where to
start on saying what was the
most delicious part of that.
That was all so good. Not the
official record. Good job to
Katina for that. Her video is
linked down in the description
but 26 minutes and 23 seconds.
Whoo. Thank you of course so
much to Dan and his wife Kim -
everybody here with Timekeeper
Distillery for hosting this
event in Wausau, Wisconsin.
Especially thanks to our
friends Ed and Marjorie for
having us in. Marjorie is from
the Philippines. She cooked a
lot of this food and it was
amazing. All made with love. I
especially loved the pancit and
the lumpia. Those were amazing
followed right behind by that
Chicken Adobo and then that
garlic fried rice was delicious
of course and then I loved that
ice cream. Everything was amazing!! If
you don't want to try this
challenge, there's other stuff
on the menu as well but thank
you guys all so much for
coming. Whoo. For winning in
under the 45 minutes, I am
going to get my $45 meal for
free. I won't get a sweet T
shirt, I don't think, but I will
have my name and photo up on
their wall of fame once they
start one but for me, it was
overall win 1033. Katina and I
will be. I'll be doing my first
challenge ever in Green Bay,
Wisconsin tomorrow but Thank
you guys for watching!!
