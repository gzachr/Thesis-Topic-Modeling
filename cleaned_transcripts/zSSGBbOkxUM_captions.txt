in this video we will explore around a village 
in Mindanao Philippines least touristy Island  
I guess not many foreigners come here no I think 
you're the first one I'm the first Foreigner here  
I was invited by a local family to spend the 
week with them to experience Filipino Village
lifeon so how is the life in rural mindanao 
okay let's see what a haircut here in rural  
Southern Philippines is going to be 
like and will people here be welcoming  
to foreign tourists what is that that's a 
a calculator you wanted to take a picture  
with the calculator let's find out feel free 
to join coconut wine tuba okay cheers thank  
you very much okay I got invited for some 
coconut wine it's a homemade homemade okay
cheers I would guess probably around 20% 
alcohol oh you finish in one go oh very slow
[Laughter]
like this yeah I would guess around 20% maybe 
it's not that strong but definitely stronger  
than than regular beer so this is how many liter 
that is 4 lit 100 pesos 100 pesos 100 pesos one  
gallon oh that's like 4 liter for 100 peso oh 
that sounds very affordable the container is  
looking dirty but this is natural you said the 
container looks dirty but the drink is good Oh  
that's oh okay okay organic organic organic 
okay okay organ organic organic wine organic  
wine okay organic what about you you don't do I 
oh he has a glass too okay okay okay in Germany  
we say post post that's a German ch ah for 
yeah yeah okay oh he's finishing in one go  
again and uh he did as well and I'm the I'm the 
slowest one I need two [Music] Zips oh a little  
bit a little bit a little bit I need to drive 
today I'm here with a motorbike I need to be  
careful don't doing too much yeah I guess a 
typical Saturday here in the village sitting  
here having some coconut RNE we're also having 
fresh pork now coming from the grill over there  
this looks delicious so we have pork we have 
rice we have some water the gallon of coconut  
wine is almost finished by now okay let's try 
some delicious looking pork here coming fresh  
from the grill thank you very much much thank you 
very much for inviting me here very delicious very
nice very good the neighbor's walking by and 
immediately gets offered a glass of coconut  
wine and once again he also finished in one go 
that seems to be the tradition here if you get  
a glass of coconut wine you have to finish 
in one go white white wine white wine white  
wine looks like white RNE coconut white coconut 
white wine okay guess I have to try this one as  
well but they just said that this one is actually 
less alcohol than the other one yeah yeah so this  
is lighter taste more carbonated there's more 
gas inside actually The Taste is very similar  
I would say you prefer this version yeah yeah 
but yeah taste this has way less alcohol than  
the other one tastes actually almost like zero 
alcohol so I would guess maybe four maximum 5%  
okay they don't stop giving me more okay little 
bit okay okay I think this is already number five  
actually quite delicious I really enjoyed actually 
drinking with the guys here coconut wine coconut
wine okay so the guys want to challenge me for 
a game of billyard so we're heading to a bilard  
now and he's actually driving with my bike the 
bike that I rented from your cousin right yeah  
yeah it's your cousin's bike and he said I can 
use the bike for a few days is he okay to drive  
no I think he's jump it's not okay to drive so 
the bike stays here yes the bike stays here okay  
guess the bike stays here then probably the the 
best idea he's bringing the coconut rine with
us okay we're going to a local billiard 
shop now which is in the village
here oh need to get out here oh you want to 
come here okay all right we have arrived at  
the billiard spot and uh from my understanding 
bilard is very popular here I see many little  
uh shops by the side of the road that have a 
pool table and then I guess you play uh you  
pay some money and then you can play here hello 
hello hello so I guess this is something popular  
to do on the weekends drinking some coconut 
wine playing pool for so the the that I know  
is you put all the balls in there and then for 
example when I have the first shot and I hit  
let's say this one then I get the the full ones 
and he has the half ones yeah is that how you  
play through no no okay what are your wordss 
first first one second you need third three  
so you need to you go by the Numbers yeah they 
go by numers yes how about this eight job bad
job okay so the table is almost cleared we have  
two balls left and this one should be 
an easy one for you oh and she missed
[Applause]
it put yeah
anywhere okay was a miss and now 
it's her chance to win the game  
oh that's not an easy shot it 
looks easy but because it's far
away okay the next game is now 
me against him Germany versus  
the Philippines Germany this is 
Philippines [Music] Philippines
I made it to the final shot again Mo 
what's easier let me see this one or  
this one yes yeah against the corner 
his chance to win the game this should  
be an easy one this should be an 
easy one why didn't he finish this
one yes
pay 50 pesos you can play yeah per 
game is 10 pesos but this one took  
a while so 5050 we p 50 pesos 
and then for all games who gets  
the money we played another game by 
the way this time uh he won against
me okay there are two missions we still 
have today I want to get a haircut here in  
the village and uh you want to show me the local 
market yes the local market because it's Market
Market okay we are in the village now there's 
a market going on here weekend Market which  
actually is quite large oh I'm standing in way 
sorry so we have a food section here and then  
we have a extra Market section which I will 
show you in a minute oh wow look at this this  
looks interesting the purple color here I think 
that is an U snake hello hello is this a u yeah  
U some of it the yellow one is I guess not OMG 
some bread OMG I heard she saying OMG oh I think  
because you dropped it right yeah oh OMG you 
dropped it I think I'm actually curious to try  
the Uber snakes here they're actually looking 
pretty good hello kamusta can I get some of
these
Mao two two for one I think two pesos for One 
Piece okay can I can I get 10 pieces 10 pieces  
okay let's just get a bag full of them I think 
they are coated in sugar that's that looks good  
yeah okay I have 50 right here okay Sal much 
you know them already I guess um yeah I tried  
one before so I think they are coated with sugar 
there's sugar around it and then we have a dough  
and we have U that's where the purple color is 
coming from but I don't think this is actually  
Uber this is a food color food color oh so 
they're faking it here actually it's not bad  
everyone I guess not many foreigners come here 
no I think you're the first one I'm the first  
Foreigner here oh what are we having here this 
looks interesting what is this right here casaba  
casaba yeah it's Caba something sweet yes yeah 
you know the brown one yeah that's sugar sugar  
okay Mao for one how much huh 10 10 10 10 do you 
want one as well uh maybe we can share you can  
share okay one piece please oh it's still warm 
so warm that's good so warm I like it if it's  
warm still is this something popular to eat 
here in the village yes it is let's give it  
a try very different texture than I would have 
expected it's very it's chewy it's fluffy very  
soft and there's a nice little sweet note to 
it not too much but if you eat the brown one  
which is coated by Sugar that's sweeter but at 
the bottom it's not so sweet oh so I thought I  
thought the brown one is coconut maybe no it's 
not coconut just sugar it's good it's not too  
sweet so maybe you like it it's not too sweet 
it's very affordable Mak it cool yeah exactly  
it's a it's a very heavy dish actually not 
really a dish but it's a heavy snack and I

baras have always different techniques to do my 
line some are doing it at the beginning some are  
doing it in the middle like this one some are 
doing it at the very end some are using a razor  
some are using like razor blades now he's 
actually continuing with the razor blades
you know when someone is working with a 
sharp razor blade on your head you can't  
move cuz you don't want them to accidentally 
uh cut something wrong oh that is actually
