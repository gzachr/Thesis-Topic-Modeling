Cheers.
Delicious
So right now we are in a local restaurant
and we ordered some food for lunch
Tocino? Yeah, one
Just after that
we are going to see the beautiful historical landmarks
of the city
What we ordered already is a mountain dew
with three rices
one fried egg, tocino, one fried chicken, two bola and two ngohiong
ngohiong
ngohiong
Basically, I think it's like lumpia but with five spices, different
and bola I don't know what is it. Yeah. We just try it
Yeah I'm really intrigued by the ngohiong  and the bola bola. Bola bola yeah
Because we have no idea of what is the taste of that. Yeah. 
And the fried chicken I suppose it will be great
As all the fried chicken that we found here in the Philippines.
Philippines they are the best. Yeah.
So yeah can't wait to try and we are so hungry right now
Let's eat.
Okay, so let's try the food now. 
I will start with the basic one, the fried chicken.
Woo, look at that.
It's crispy and juicy, very nice.
Now I will try the tocino
Look at that
It has been grilled
And I think I can put the spicy sauce too. 
Dip in the spicy sauce.
Very good
Simple
And the sauce
is really great too
Little bit of sour
And
And spiciness
Very great
I will try the ngohiong
ngohiong?
ngohiong
sorry
I'm sure I pronounce it badly
but it's similar to a spring roll
I don't know if it's meat inside or vegetables
They gave us also sauce
but I will just try
plain like that first
Oh it's different
It's not same as spring roll
There's a lot of meat actually
Can you show me inside?
Ah, really tasty
Dip in the sauce.
The sauce is sour.
I think it's similar to the first sauce
without the chili
So I think I prefer the first sauce
with the chilli
Bola bola
I wonder what is inside.
There's a little bit of vegetables and...
I don't know
But it's really tasty
Ah, we just finished our lunch
And now we are going to
the Heritage of Monument.
I'm not sure what is it but I saw it on Google map
So, we are going to check it out.
Wow, look at that
This is beautiful
Can we go further?
Yeah, I think so.
Ah very beautiful. We can see some church. 
I hope there is some explanation
Really beautiful piece of art from Eduardo Castrillo
It's really impressive no?
It is
I really like how the artist work
to represent everything in Cebu actually.
There are so many details
From the church, from the people
It's in the street just like almost in a residential area. Yeah
And you can just see this
just out of nowhere
It's quite surprising
And it's not a little
small piece of art
Ah yeah it's very big
It is our first time here in Cebu city.
We are grateful to be here.
To be able to visit this city.
We just began our exploration.
I feel it will be an excellent day :).
What about you guys? What are you grateful for today?.
Ah we visited the cathedral, Basilic and the cross of Magellan
And it was really beautiful. Yeah
They are not far from each other. So it's really easy to visit.
the cathedral was really beautiful, big
And then a mass was going on. Hm.
I have never been in a mass
So it was really interesting to assist to one
Then we went to the Basilic.
We are now in front of the basilic and
there is many many people today
even the road is closed
for the pedestrians
I was really impressed too. It was so big
I didn't know it was that large 
And inside was very beautiful. There was many rooms
And there were also mass going on in the basilic
so there were so many people. Woa so many. Yeah.
It's nice also to see that everybody just gather around 
in one place
at the same moment
and then we went to the cross of Magellan
if I understood well
he was an expeditor 
long time ago, so when he came here in Cebu
and he implemented this cross
the cross that we can see here
just nice to witness something like this
historic moment like this
And now we are going to see the fort San Pedro
maybe we can go
to one famous street here
This is the
Colon Street. Nice.
I think this is one of the oldest
street of the Philippines
So I'm really intrigued to see how is it there
Me too.
It's pleasant to walk here. Hm.
Ah, it's really nice here
I really wasn't expected
I really wasn't expected a park here
just before the fort.
This is quite a large park actually.
There's many people just walking around
a lot of flowers
beautiful area to walk
But yeah, we had a great time here in the park
and now we will go to the fort
Ah these are interesting pictures
to understand a little bit the founding of Cebu
Ah look at that, this is the map of Cebu
Initially drawn by  Magellan
Ah this is Bohol
But where is Cebu?
Cebu?
Ah zzubu peut etre? Maybe?
Maybe zzubu?
Ah this is the planting of the cross by Magellan
I don't know if this is the the same place
as
we were just before or not
Okay now we are inside the fort
what is the name?
San Pedro
Fort San Pedro
and it costs 30 pesos per person
and it's funny because I gave her 70
and she just gave me back 10 pesos
but you can see that it's two different 5 pesos
I found it interesting to have two different
Yeah two different
I don't know if it's only for the 5 or even for
other..
I think I saw also for the 1 peso
but maybe it's a new one and old one. Okay. So it still
Interesting. Yeah
I prefer this one
Yeah, I like it too.
It's really interesting to walk on the fort
Wow look at
Just here at the bottom of the fort
you can see so many people here playing around
Volleyball
Here a lot of people dancing
There too
It's really nice
to see all the people enjoying
Ah here too
Some people dancing too
Do you want to play volleyball too?
Yeah, it reminds me of
when we were teenagers and playing
It's really nice to see everybody just here and
enjoying the Sunday. Yeah
With friends and playing, exercising
Outside
Outdoor activity is good
And we can see that they all having fun. Yeah
If I understood well, the fort was built by the Spanish against the hostility of the natives
and it has the triangle shape
two sides facing the sea and one
side facing the land.
It feel always special to walk in a historic place like this one.
It was built to be protected from enemies.
But now, it's happiness and friendship all around the fort :).
Nice. Little ice cream. What is the flavor?
I don't know.
It's raining but it's okay
We can eat ice cream anytime.
It's still hot
20 pesos
Oh it's delicious
This one I think is yam
the purple one
and the yellow?
Mango
I guess
It looks delicious and refreshing
Thank you
More?
Tiny cup
Cute isn't it? Yeah really cute.
We are now heading to the Colon Street
but this is already so lively here
There's so many people on the street. A lot of shops. 
It reminds me a little bit of
Manila
Some area of Manila where it's really bustling
Yeah. So I wonder how is Colon Street.
We can't believe we will be on the oldest street of the Philippines :).
There is a unlimited number of street in the Phillipines.
And we will be on the oldest one.
So lucky :).
Wow, we are now on Colon Street and this is really busy.
So many people
and there's a lot of street vendors, a lot of shops
And it looks so interesting
There's also a shopping mall
and I think there, there is a
Maybe a night market, I don't know
Yeah, I think they just started to put the stalls
But yeah, so many things going on now. 
Maybe there is a market taking place here
I think we are going to wait like 20 minutes. Now, everybody is busy
Yeah we'll we come back later
Yeah, in 20, 30 minutes
It will be very nice
It's 6.20pm now and it's definitely open.
I can't wait to go there
Let's go
Woo the atmosphere feels really different
So many people now and a lot of stalls. 
They work so fast but now
everything is well installed.
For now, it's almost only clothes
and stuff to buy
I wonder if there is also foods. Yeah
We are more interested by the foods.
We are so happy to be here right now. 
Because this is something that we didn't expect
We didn't know that there was a
night market here at Colon Street
We didn't plan it actually so. We were surprised when we see it
And it's a good surprise. Yeah
We just wanted to see Colon Street. Yeah.
And now we found a night market. Yeah
Super lively night market
We are so happy we found this night market.
It was not planned at all.
This is why we love to travel.
The unexpected is more memorable than the planned one.
We will remember this day at Cebu city.
As the day when we found the huge night market .
So it's been like 10 minutes, 15 minutes we walked in this market
and we didn't see the food yet
but a lot of interesting stuffs
like clothing, watch, head band, jewellery
almost anything you can find it here
yeah so many things
but we will continue to walk in this market
and see if we can find food
Traffic jam?
Yeah, it's difficult to circulate sometimes
The night market is so long.
It's been more than 30 minutes we are walking
and we still don't see the end.
Still don't see the end
and still don't see the food
Filipino are so lovely. Just want to share love :).
I think we found the food
We just have to cross the road
Yeah, okay there is many bus now but
Yeaaah, we can eat
Oh yeah, I can see foods.
There's some fruits here. Okay.
Ahh okay
I can start to smell foods too.
I'm hungry.
Here we have Puto.
Puto bumbong
But I don't know what it's like
I think it's sweet.
But it looks very delicious
and we can buy four pieces for 50
So maybe we will try. Yeah
Try the dessert first?
Yeah. Yeah, no problem
Thank you
We always start with the desserts
Okay, so this one
But it looks so good. Yeah, it looks delicious
and so I think it's rice cake
Glutinuos rice
with some cheese and condensed milk
Wow super combo
And super delicious
I'm just curious about the taste of the cheese
I'm little bit curious.
because mixing with the sweetness, I don't know
No, it's so delicious. Oh yeah? Yeah
I prepare one for you
Oh it's so good
The cheese make me think about the
laughing cow
La vache qui rit
So easy to eat
We are going to finish it now
All finished. Super clean
Finished. So delicious
Let's move on
Can't wait to eat more
It's so funny because we are literally at the
beginning of the food part
It was like the first or second stall
It's so funny
I'm so curious about this one
Yeah. People are just standing around
and they eat
directly here
Everyone is so helpful.
Even the vendor shows us how to open :).
Thank you.
This is how we open
Smells good
I'm going to try with the rice
Oh the sauce is so good
It's spicy but not too much spciy
Yeah I can smell it from here actually
It smells so good
The rice has a flavor
The sauce is so good
It reminds me of fermented tofu or something like this
but not salted at all
Just the spiciness
You have to try
I'm going to try the siomai now
It's spicy
Okay be ready Dan
I'm going to give you some
Ah yeah the sauce
It's good. It's good?
You want to try one siomai?

So I think the rice is puto and then siomai
It's okay? It's quite spicy actually
It's spicy yeah
It may be a little bit too spicy for me
But I like it 
I cannot lie I like it
but you can see my
my lip start to be red right?
It burns
Yeah, maybe I cannot finish it alone but
you will help me
This is such a nice way to eat food.
All standing around the food stall :).
Finish
After eating something that spicy, maybe you need a drink?
Yeah. Yeah, definitely where?
I don't know.
I think it's mango shake
Oh it looks really refreshing
You can see the smoke
Ah
It's really sweet
I think they add condensed milk inside, I'm not sure
It's so refreshing right now
Because it is so hot here
It's hot and there's a lot of people so
Now it's super hot
With this, it's perfect
It's so cold
It feels really nice to see all the people being happy.
Simply eating delicious food.
And enjoying a great night in Cebu.
With family and friends.
Such a great vibe.

He gave this to you?
It's 50 pesos.
Oh, it looks delicious.
It's so delicious that you cannot stop.
It's super sweet too
It is the first time I eat the fruits like this
A lot of pieces of fruits inside a
glass like that with
full of milk
Interesting
It's not yogurt
but it reminds me of my dad's
dessert
when he mixes yoghurt with fruits inside
This one is milk
and I always make fun of him but
It's really good actually
He will be jealous right now
Banana
It was an amazing first day in Cebu city.
