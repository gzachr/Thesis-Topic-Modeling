Hi everyone.
Andy Davis here again from Master of Voice,
a channel with reactions to performers from
across the world.
In this episode, another video featuring A
Night of Wonder from the Disney Plus Philippines
launch just a few months back and I'm so excited
to see this today.
Let's jump right in.
[Music]
All of these artists are new to me.
So, I'm excited.
Oh, one of my favorites, "When You Wish Upon
a Star".
When you wish (Zephanie) upon a star,
Makes no difference who you are.
Beautiful.
Anything your heart desires
Will come to you. (Nice!)
If your heart is in your dream,
No request is too extreme.
You guys, she's beautiful and has
a gorgeous voice, as well.
Right now in her mid-chest voice.
Now, moving into a bit of a mixed sound, upper
chest voice, just above maybe in the mix.
Really nice.
Really nice.
Of course, you all know I'm a huge Disney
fan and so hearing "When You Wish Upon A Star"
is just beautiful.
I also love the breathiness around some of
her notes.
Just really utilizing that breath control,
not only for support of the musical phrase
and for dynamics, but also for a bit of color
(and) nuance there in the timbre.
I love this.
When you wish upon a star,
As dreamers do.
Fate is kind
Oh, a bit more of a belting voice here.
She brings to those who love
Nice!
The sweet fulfillment of their secret longing!
Like a bolt out of the blue
You guys, a 
great key change there.
But, wow!
She's put a different edge to her sound here
in her upper chest voice with more of a belting
sound here and I love it.
She's excellent!
Fate steps in and sees you through.
When you wish upon a star, (Great control!)
Your dreams come true.
What a beautiful head voice! Oh! I love Moana!
It calls me. (Wow!)
I've been staring (Janella) at the edge of the water.
'Long as I can remember,
Never really knowing why. (This is a great song!)
I wish I could be the perfect daughter.
But, I come back to the water.
No matter how hard I try.
I love this movie.
Every turn I take, Every trail I track.
Every path I make, Every road leads back.
To the place I know (She's great!) where I cannot go
Where I long to be...
See the line where the sky meets the sea?
It calls me... (It calls me.)
You guys, she's doing this so well.
I love the timbre to her voice, as well.
You know, we're in her mid-chest voice here
as well.
A lot of Disney songs kind of ride there especially
for the verse.
I, first of all, Moana is one of my favorite.
Lin-Manuel Miranda.
Encanto, and others, you know, Hamilton, In
the Heights.
Huge composer.
(A) great, great composer.
Also assisted (and wrote) songs in Moana and
you can tell.
They are so catchy and wonderful.
She's performing this so well here and I love
her beautiful pink dress, as well.
And no one knows,
How far it goes. (Nice!)
If the wind in my sail on the sea stays behind me.
One day I'll know,
If I go, there's just no telling how far I'll go!
(See the light as it shines on the sea?
It's blinding.)
Oh, my gosh!
But no one knows,
How deep it goes.
You guys, great dynamic contrasts here.
Really loud singing here, the, really letting
it pour out of her on the great breath support.
Not over-singing, just taking it to the edge
we want to hear in excellent belting and I
love it!
And it seems like it's calling out to me.
So come find me,
And let me know. How far I'll Go!
Wow, wonderful!
and I love The Lion King.
From the day we arrive on the planet,
And, blinking, step into the sun.
There's more to see than can ever be seen.
More to do than can ever be done.
(Nice.) There's far too much to take in here.
His voice is a little more focused, a little
thinner in the vowel as far as the resonant
quality around it.
Really great command to the stage, utilizing
that breath control already.
I can tell with his differences in dynamic
contrasts that he is also very musical.
What some talented singers the Philippines
has and talented young singers.
This is exciting!
More to find than can ever be found.
But the sun rolling high. (Wow!)
Through the sapphire sky.
Keeps great and small on the endless round.
It's the circle of life, (Wonderful!)
And it moves us all.
You guys, he has a great pop voice with some,
a little bit of a riff and nuance here, a
little crack here and there, a glottal to
start the phrase.
It's all a wonderful package and his vocal
arsenal of skills here and it's all on full
display in an excellent Disney song, you guys.
The circle of life and he is giving it life.
I love it!
Through despair and hope,
Through faith and love.
Wonderful.
'Til we find our place
On the path unwinding.
In the circle,
Great range.
The circle of life. Circle of life.
Oh, yes!
Oh, I love this!
Every day's a little harder,
As I feel my power grow.
Don't you know there's part of me,
That longs to go...
Into the unknown?
Into the unknown.
Into the unknown. Into the unknown!
Wow, I love this song from Frozen 2.
Idina Menzel (and) Aurora (are) just amazing.
I've got to feature that performance on here,
too.
I didn't know this song was part of this.
Oh!
I'm a little emotional today.
My mom's in the hospital and I wanted to do
some videos.
You Know music heals me, you guys.
Music's my therapy but, "Into the Unknown"
for some reason, it's just tugging at my heartstrings.
And these wonderful, wonderful young singers.
Such a powerful song.
I love this today.
Oh, oh, oh.
Are you out there? Do you know me?
Can you feel me? Can you show me?
Ah-ah, ah-ah. Anything your heart desires...
Where are you going?
Don't leave me alone
How do I follow you
Wonderful harmony!
Into the unknown?
Oh, my word, you guys.
Wow, wow, wow, wow!
The ending with all those wonderful belting
harmonies and then they got a section where
they all got to put in a piece of the original
song they sung.
And, then end with the incredible, just wonderful
vocals, you know.
It's hard to really match sometimes when you're
belting, you know, in a group with people.
They sound so great together.
I've got to go back a little bit.
Okay, y'all, we're back, and let's hear this
ending again.
It's incredible!
I mean
First of all, a wonderful arrangement of all
these songs.
You would always have to know Disney's going
to put together a wonderful medley of their
own music with some excellent key changes
(and) differences.
This group of young talented singers from
the Philippines just blew me away.
My first time hearing all three of them.
I, especially, love the unison section right
there at the end going back into the chorus
before they ascended the phrase and then got
to their own harmony part at the top of the
phrase in their belting voices.
Wow!
I can't wait to hear this so much more.
You guys, wow!
Oh, I hope you all enjoyed this reaction as
much as I did today.
