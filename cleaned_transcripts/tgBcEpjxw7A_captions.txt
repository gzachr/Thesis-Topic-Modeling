hello and welcome back this is randall 
meek with the philippines project  
and i'm here to tell you another story about 
my first trip to the philippines so get ready
so it was 2007 uh when my wife and i decided 
that we would go back to the philippines  
we'd been married in 2001 and i had 
never been to the philippines and so  
i got my first uh idea of what it might be like it 
seemed like every saturday sunday morning we would  
lay in bed and she would talk to me about the 
philippines and tell me stories about things that  
happened in the philippines and just how life was 
it was just so fascinating to me that it really  
sparked an interest in me you know trying to get 
to the philippines and and just experience that  
lifestyle or or the culture for myself and i 
always have been interested in travel ever since  
i guess probably my 20s i just really wanted to 
go and so this was the first international trip  
i really had ever been on so this is what 
this is about i remember i'll just tell you  
basically about the descent into the philippines 
so start there in the airplane and and it's it  
was like a 24-hour flight right everybody if you 
researched it at all you know the flight is very  
long and so we were tired and i had no idea what 
to expect when i got there and it seemed like it  
was probably eleven o'clock in the morning to one 
o'clock in the afternoon i don't really remember  
we landed in the philippines and everything 
is big i don't know 7 47 or whatever but uh  
i don't know what kind of plane it was but we got 
off and you know we wait and get the baggage and  
everything out of the overhead container and we 
walk down the aisle i never will forget that first  
kind of i'll call it a blast of air uh when i got 
off the plane this is 2007 and uh the nia airport  
the the air terminal one in the philippines in 
manila was about and i could be wrong i think they  
had two terminals back then but it was not air 
conditioned and not air conditioned really doesn't  
cover it's just like this humid just blast it 
just hits you directly in the face and it's like  
as an american you know and used to comfort and 
and uh all everything being easy and it was just  
a different experience i mean it's like oh my 
god you know i'm a guy i think i was built for  
probably uh living in the northern areas in 
a colder climate but man this hot air just  
blasted me in face so we'll just walk down the 
corridor toward the main part of the airport and  
you know where we're gonna get our baggage and all 
that stuff and walk down this long hallway and all  
these uniformed people and and uh pretty amazing 
one thing that you do notice when you first get  
here there's a lot of like police guards and you 
know that around the area so it kind of struck me  
and i remember and you got to remember this is 
my first time so these are my first impressions  
of being here so we got in there and they 
have this big duty-free shop and i can't  
remember i i don't think we bought anything 
that time but we walked in what i did not know  
and this is a filipino tradition uh with families 
when they have somebody visiting from abroad  
that um there's a lot of people that show up 
to pick them up at the airport kind of it may  
may not be the same now as it was back then 
but i'm sure it's done a lot i know my family  
here you know they like to come up and and greet 
us at the airport and then we drive back home well  
when we got to the airport there was her 
brother and sister-in-law that met us there  
and her mom they were traveling together and 
they came into manila to get us and and pick  
us up from the airport and i saw her her mom 
for the second time i'd actually met her in  
singapore where i met my wife the first time so i 
knew who she was and her brother arvin was there  
and his uh his wife jenny and so you know 
we met them and it was great reunion and  
and they hugged and everything and 
you know it's pretty emotional stuff  
and and so we walk out and you know of course 
being english speaker i did not know every all  
the conversations that are going on i don't know 
it's totally strange to me totally new and so
it's kind of a little bit of a culture shock you 
know there's just so much coming at you all at  
one time so we get out and we get our luggage 
and we're pushing our little cart out there  
and so we get out to the parking lot and we wave 
at some people or they wave at us and we wave back  
it was her family her extended 
family on her dad's side  
and her dad had already passed away so he wasn't 
there uh but come to find out they had rented a  
a big van and it was just full of people and 
we're trying to get the luggage in there and  
get floor in there and arvind the brother and 
the wife and and flores uh mother patricia  
all trying to get in the van with the other 
people that were in i'm thinking oh my gosh  
who are all these people you know just it was 
like this thing that they do though you know and  
and so i finally got in the front seat and uh 
there was a driver there you know they a lot of  
a lot of filipinos don't drive uh they'll hire 
somebody for a little bit longer distance where  
we were going was at least a good half an hour to 
45 minutes away from the airport so you know they  
hired a professional driver to come in and he had 
the van so we all got in and we headed out and the  
first thing i remember is as we were coming out of 
the airport terminal itself in the van it was like  
you could call it six lanes of traffic but it more 
resembled just like a bunch of vehicles just going  
one way you know and some some were going 
the other way and there really weren't lines  
on the street or anything like that 
it was just a very chaotic traffic  
plan or lack of plan and you know we were in this 
van and we just start easing out into this massive  
traffic going by and think oh my god what's wrong 
you know but it's just the way manila is and was  
especially back then really there were no rules 
so this guy he gets in it and basically just inch  
your way into the traffic and and then they stop 
and then finally we just kind of made a left and  
had to stop traffic all the way around and very 
chaotic to me and i thought wow this is something  
else and i kind of expected my expectation was 
it's going to be a little bit like mexico which  
i'd never been to mexico but i'd seen a lot of 
stuff on tv and and so it kind of was like that  
and but we got out in the city and it was stop 
and go for a while and then we got out on a pretty  
nice highway it kind of resembled a u.s interstate 
and you know we're going towards pampanga uh  
and a little town called san machas which is 
close to san fernando from pampanga in in the uh  
in luzon there in the philippines so we're out 
there we're flying down this road and they're all  
catching up behind me i'm sitting in the front 
seat and the driver's over here and they're all  
behind me and i look back check on my wife every 
once in a while they're just chit-chatting and i  
have no idea at all what's going on so um we're 
probably in the car for 45 minutes in a van  
and they said do you want to stop i'm like well 
yeah i might stop and you know use the restroom  
they can't pass me do you want something to eat 
you know are you hungry and they to be honest  
they were very caring about my well-being and my 
situation so you know that was nice so we stopped  
at this i'm going to call it a truck stop it was 
a rest stop of some sort i had a big gas station  
had a uh you know big lines where you could get 
gas and there were some bigger trucks in there  
and so it was that was pretty familiar but what 
happened next kind of caught me off guard so i  
was like okay well i'm just going to get out 
you know and go into the truck stop and use  
the restroom and maybe get a drink or something 
come back out no big deal right well enter this  
enters her uncle uh into the picture here 
or into the story uh his name is uh augusto  
they call him bops you know which is i guess uh i 
guess it's kappa pongan for uncle or whatever but  
he was bops okay he's uh probably 
back then he was in his 40s  
and he kind of had a reputation from what i had 
heard the stories that i've heard over the years  
that he'd went to saudi arabia he'd worked in 
construction there and and uh he was a he's  
a good-looking guy you know um and you know the 
straight black hair he had the glasses and he had  
the decent looking clothes on and you know thin 
guy and the only thing i really have a reference  
for this guy augusto or bops was that this picture 
that my wife had or i had seen of him doing this  
this karate kick like in midair i don't know where 
they took it whether it was in saudi arabia or  
what but he had quite a reputation for being 
you know knowing martial arts okay so this is  
the guy that he gets out you know and he's looking 
around like this and i kind of get concerned i'm  
like wow is this a dangerous place or what and i 
know the philippines it's it was a develop it's a  
developing country and so you know you hear all 
the warnings all you know this and that and so  
he jumps out and he's looking around like this 
and he waves me on and i had to follow him and the  
whole time his head's just on a swivel like this 
and i'm thinking oh my gosh you know what what's  
going on here are we in danger uh am i gonna 
be you know is there a threat of kidnapping or  
something like this and looking back i i don't 
really think there was much but the fact that  
they thought there probably was you know it was a 
real deal for them and they didn't want anything  
to happen to me i mean i'm married into the 
family at this point so probably gonna hear some  
music go by um so anyway we walk in and he's 
in front of me and i got to follow him and  
he just keeps looking back at me motioned 
me to where to go and with the restroom and  
everything and by that time i'm in the restroom 
and i'm you know standing there for the urinal  
i'm just like i'm looking around oh my god you 
know somebody gonna pop out from one of the  
stalls you know and hold a knife to my throat 
or something like oh my gosh what's going on  
but he was there and then i turned 
around to wash my hands and to leave and  
he wasn't anywhere to be found so oh my gosh you 
know just for a second and i so i walked toward  
the door of the restroom and walked out and he 
was right there so and we walked we got back in  
but that was kind of a surreal experience 
i kind of felt like i kind of felt like a  
a political prisoner or maybe a deposed dictator 
or something like that i mean i just had this  
entourage following me back to the van you 
know i was like is everything going to be okay  
so it was a little bit uh that was a little bit 
taken aback by that but we got back in the van  
and we we go on into pompanga and we get there and 
we drive and and uh we get into this little barn  
guy and it's like it's like a little gate to the 
community you know it's or in in english we'd say  
saint matthew son saint matthews is how they spell 
it salmon chasse but it's just a small bar and guy  
and augusto uh or bops he was actually a barn 
guy official in that little town so he kind of  
had some connections and if things went wrong 
or you had a problem he was the guy to go to  
you know so he's you know to me at that point he 
was kind of a character and a guy you could trust  
and kind of rely on it and it'd make you feel safe 
wherever you went so you know nobody mess with  
bops especially you know if you're in that barn 
guy everybody knows him so anyway we we go down  
this little gravel road or dirt road and there's 
there's just houses on each side and we just kind  
of come to us i thought stop right in the middle 
of the road wow what's going on well evidently we  
were there and so everybody starts getting out 
of the van and i don't know why i just remember  
you know nobody would let me carry any luggage 
but you know so they all got the luggage and  
everything and so i'm walking where they're 
pointing me to and it's this little alley  
probably less than 10 feet wide and so 
we walked in i don't i don't even know if  
we're actually there yet i i have no idea and 
nobody's filling me in you know i'm just like  
i'm the candle i'm the white guy the americano 
guy so i'm just following what they say to do so  
i step across this little little stream of water 
that's kind of just uh you know going down the  
road there and we walk down this little concrete 
pathway and there's like a little door open there  
and come to find out this is his house okay 
when we walk beside there was another couple of  
little homes there or or doorways you know it's 
kind of like almost all one complex there and  
we walk in and and of course we are completely 
completely wore out it's very very hot in this  
house and they made it as cool as they could 
but they didn't have any air conditioning so  
forget that that's not going to happen so anyway 
we go in and they said well come on come on  
upstairs they wanted us to rest you know so that 
was great we go up this little set of steps and  
and we turn right and they open the door to this 
little bedroom and it's like we've prepared this  
but especially for you you know for you and floor 
and of course i don't they didn't say that but  
you know i could tell they'd set this aside for 
us to stay in and they wanted us to stay with them  
and that was really nice and and the hospitality 
really in the philippines and especially in  
pampanga or probably all over the philippines 
but i experienced a great amount of hospitality  
they've considered me and my wife before they 
considered themselves we always got the best of  
everything they could give us and you know it is 
really i can remember standing up upstairs before  
we went to our bedroom and we're just standing 
there in the doorways to the right and the  
family's right there and bops is there and his 
wife and you know some other people that are there  
it just was really an emotional time for me 
for some reason i don't really understand why  
but he was saying something and i just kind of 
felt compelled to say something you know before we  
take off and go into the bedroom and i remember  
i just really thanked him for you know their 
hospitality and staying in the house and i  
sometimes i do i just almost broke down and 
started crying tears came to my eyes you know and  
and i was just really grateful you know uh 
these people don't have much to offer but  
they were given everything plus you know for 
us and that's what you find in the philippines  
that's and not everyone but you know most people 
have your back here they don't want to see you  
hurt they have very good intentions they want 
to make you feel at home as much as absolutely  
possible they give you everything that they can 
so you know that was great we turned and went  
into the door and for the first time since we 
landed we were by ourselves we shut the door and  
i look in the room and and there's a couple 
little thin mattresses of foam about like that  
you know and uh they had a little sheet over 
them and then a little flat pillow at the end  
and there was a there was a fan on the floor and a 
little window that had bars on it you know and so  
we laid down there just on the concrete floor i 
don't think there was any tile just concrete floor  
and uh in a fan well we were so wore out i 
couldn't believe it i thought i'll never be  
able to sleep here you know but somehow or other 
about two hours later two and a half hours later i  
woke up fans still going i got some sleep so that 
was pretty cool and i and that was my my my first  
introduction you know it was quite a bit to take 
in at the time and i never will forget we got up  
that that afternoon and um we i think we went one 
other place maybe to meet some family or whatever  
and we had a nice dinner and we come back that 
evening and and uh i don't know it was just  
it was my first time in a developing country and 
and living among people that had considerably less  
than i have ever had in my life and you know 
again the hospitality was out of this world so  
you know we kind of get ourselves together and 
then we go down and take a shower that's a whole  
nother issue a whole other story but downstairs 
i had one bathroom downstairs and of course if  
you're filipino you know uh when you walk in the 
bathroom real quick you walk into the the bathroom  
they have a toilet of course and then they have 
like this it's a brick everything is blocked  
right everything is hollow block they call it but 
then they have this hollow block that has like  
decorations or whatever and air can pass through 
and you can kind of see outside and people can't  
really see in that well so and then in the wall 
there's this just a little faucet that comes out  
you can turn off and turn on and then there's 
a five gallon bucket on the floor and this is  
probably two feet off the ground just higher 
than the five gallon bucket and then there's  
this little little plastic thing with a handle 
on it about that deep just floating around in  
that bucket full of water okay that's interesting 
so but come to find out that's how you take your  
shower you know one of the things you do with it 
but you fill the bucket over water you take the  
they call it a temple but it's it's just like a 
big scoop you know for us in america and you pour  
it over your head and the water's cold not as cold 
as our water in america thank god for that because  
it's so hot but and you your body's so hot at that 
point it kind of makes you shiver you know and and  
wow your first tabo shower is quite an experience 
but we got cleaned up and got upstairs and  
you know there's there's lizards on the ceiling 
about this long and and you know there's the fans  
going and i think man am i ever going to 
go to sleep here and i think we were still  
pretty exhausted at that point and i never will 
forget and this is what i really want to get to  
we we went to sleep i don't know how but the next 
morning you know we're laying on that little thin  
mat and a little pillow and it's just like kind 
of wake up and fans going and i look around  
and i really didn't realize where i was at 
you know it was you ever wake up and you just  
for some reason it doesn't click what you've been 
doing or where you're at you're in a strange place  
and i wake up and and i look around and again 
i didn't really for a second i didn't think i  
i look up and i see this window and it's got bars 
on it i hear strange noises out in the street  
and you know the fan is just whirling around and 
i look around it's a concrete floor and this all  
happened like in the space of three seconds so 
it's not like i was in some kind of delusion or  
anything but wow i thought it was like i was 
in prison or something just for a second i  
i had you know just a strange reaction i'm like 
oh okay yeah we're we're in the philippines okay  
and not too much later maybe it stirred my wife 
awake and i hear this little knock at the door  
and i kind of look what's going on i open the 
door and there's bops my my wife's uncle uh her  
dad's brother and he he's holding holding a cup 
of coffee which i later found out it's called cafe  
so that's what they call it and so he 
hands me this cup of cafe and i look at it  
kind of smell it and i thought i thought it was 
expected to be coffee and i took a sip of it and  
i thought it was hot chocolate you know because 
what they do is they they put in the nescafe  
classico which is really a dark coffee and it's 
an instant coffee you know probably hadn't tasted  
instant coffee since the sometime in the 70s you 
know but and then they put like two tablespoons of
coffee mate in there and then they put like 
two table or a tablespoon of brown sugar  
they stir it all up and that was their cafe 
so he handed me that and he had a cup in his  
hand he said come on so i follow him i've got my 
cup of coffee we walk down these concrete stairs  
and kind of turn to the left and on the right 
his wife cecile she's making breakfast okay  
and smelled pretty darn good but anyway it's 
a it's a it's just a a propane stove with two  
burners you see the the hose go down to the 
bottom and there's a propane tank down there  
probably we'd call it like a 20 propane tank and 
she's got two things going and two two different  
dishes she's got a bunch of fried eggs off to the 
side on the plate she's got hot dogs that are kind  
of scored on both sides they're kind of weird 
looking to me but i mean they had hot dogs and  
she's cooking longanisa which is a filipino and 
especially ah most longanisa or filipino sausage  
a lot of it is made in pompanga because pampanga 
is known for the best cooks in the philippines  
they have that reputation so whatever cecile 
was down there cooking everything we walk past  
walk out the little door that i walked in 
that morning or that that the previous day  
and we walked down and and out to the dirt street 
right and there's little houses across the street  
over there and uh he opens up this little door 
and pulls out this little wooden bench sets it  
down he takes a little cloth and he whips you know 
he cleans it off you know and he said let's sit  
down here so he doesn't he doesn't speak english 
hardly at all so we're not really communicating  
but i understand he wants me to go downstairs 
and drink some coffee with him so we sit back and  
we sit down on the little little bench that he 
made probably about this high off the ground  
and you know i just started to take in the 
scenes that i see that morning and of course  
everything's brand new to me but here's kind of 
the way it is if i look to my right i look over  
and there was a rooster on to the right of us the 
next door and he had a little rope or a little  
string around one of his feet and it was you 
know over to the right side there was a little  
stick stuck in the ground i was like wow 
okay so there's a rooster over there and  
and uh you know across the street you 
know there's little kids in uniforms  
little girls and little boys they have these 
little colorful uniforms on white shirt blue  
blue skirt or blue pants black shoes you 
know the girls may have had some kind of  
little white stockings on black hair you know 
they're all just and they're chit chatting and  
jeepneys are coming by and picking them 
you know they'll get into a jeepney or  
get onto a tricycle which is if you don't know 
it's just a motorcycle with a little side car  
and the little children were getting picked up and 
they're going off to school and you see this play  
out maybe this house over here hires one guy this 
one over here they have a little van they get in  
and it's just a flurry of activity at that point 
in the morning and it's you know for the whole day  
it's pretty nice it's pretty cool and so we're 
just sitting back kind of taking it in and you  
know there's a lot of activity in the street and 
then you know kind of looking around trying to  
communicate a little bit look at that or look 
at this little dogs running by cats you know  
or whatever and people saying good morning you 
know to you and of course you know you're always  
a spectacle if you're if you're not in a big city 
in the philippines you know you kind of you're a  
white guy or a foreigner in general you're going 
to stand out so you know you get the good morning  
or a lot of them said hi joe you know they 
say hi joe for whatever reason g.i joe i guess  
because you know there's a big military 
presence in the philippines for you know  
for years and years um so anyway all of a sudden 
it's like somebody just pulled the rug out and  
and all the activity was gone right it 
just got quiet the streets were clear  
and that's one thing i really like about the 
philippines it's in the morning if you get  
up early before everybody gets out say five 
o'clock 5 30 you start to see things happen  
somebody will be outside and this was the case 
that morning somebody will be outside and they'll  
have this little broom looks like it's made out 
of sticks and they'll be sweeping up trash that's  
been thrown down or sweeping rocks or you know 
whatever maybe who knows little pieces of paper  
and uh and then you know then they were like sweep 
it up in a little pile they'd start a little fire  
and they would sweep the other trash in there and 
they couldn't clean up their place in the morning  
but after that nothing except for you 
know maybe an occasional motorcycle go by  
a jeepney would go by and you know you go through 
that and then it's just time to start your day  
whatever you're gonna do so that was my uh my 
first experience of a morning like that in the  
philippines so we went back in the house and 
we had eggs we had longanisa we had hot dogs  
of course rice we had a lot of rice and we had 
our breakfast and i don't remember what was on  
the agenda that day but i do remember my first 
experience my first night and arrive on my first  
afternoon and my first night and morning in 
the philippines and i never will forget it i  
never will forget just the side of cecile 
you know cooking and i don't know there's  
just something about it there's something about 
the philippines that got me and ever since then  
ever since i've been back in the states i've 
always been homesick for the philippines if
