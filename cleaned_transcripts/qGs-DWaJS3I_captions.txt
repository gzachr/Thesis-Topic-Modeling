Now it begins.
Now it begins.
Gotta get the camera ready.
This is what Marc and I call
the budget airline pre-check check.
We are flying Air Asia today and they are
very sticky about the weight limits
so we’re doing our little pre-flight check.
Before we check in.
-Getting my camera all hooked up.
We check our bags ourselves before we check in.
That’s right.
It’s a double check.
Yeah, we’re wearing our heaviest shoes.
Marc is unpacking the heaviest camera.
Yeah.
So that he can “wear it around his neck.”
Instead of it counting…
It’s different when it’s around your neck
than when it’s in your bag, right?
It actually is.
Yeah.
Same thing with laptops.
I usually take out our laptops
and I carry them in my hand
because somehow that doesn’t matter.
Yeah.
Semantics, friends.
-Things we’ve picked up over the years.
8.2?
8.2.
I think it could be 7, right?
Yeah it’s a kilo over.
So we are a kilo over on this bag
and we are a kilo under with the other bag
so I just have to transport a kilo
from one to to the other.
So this is going to get a kilo lighter
and this is going to get a kilo more.
Even though they’re both going
side-by-side on the same airplane.
This looks like a kilo, doesn’t it?
Yeah but if you wear it, it doesn’t count.
Because then it’s fashion.
Zero kilos.
We’re at the airport in Puerto Princesa in Palawan
and today is a totally different kind of travel day
because on the other end of this flight
is something that we don’t usually get.
It’s an especially big day for Marc so
I’m going to go check in with him.
How are you feeling?
I have a mix of emotions
because I have family all the way across the world
that I’ve never met before
and we’re going to go meet them.
Today.
Today…right now.
In just a couple hours.
Yeah.
Are you excited?
I’m excited.
I’m also quite nervous.
Have you ever done anything like this?
No.
Not really.
Did you ever think we’d get the chance to do this?
Never.
I’m so excited because we’re going to
go meet my Filipino family.
Thank you.
Hi.
Thank you.
That feeling when you didn’t know
you had a meal included in your ticket.
I think we accidentally selected a meal
and then when we got on the plan
it smelled so good and I really wanted one.
And then it was like winning the lottery
watching the cart come towards us.
And she was like Eileen and Marc?
Check!
That looks ridiculous!
Welcome to Cebu!
Welcome to Cebu.
Here we are!
I think the coolest thing is that normally when you
arrive in a place you’ve never been before,
every time, you know,
you walk out with your luggage
and you see people waiting for their loved ones
and I always kind of think inside like,
oh I wish someone was waiting for me.
And now…
It’s going to be us!
There are people waiting for us!
We will be out soon!!!
Off to meet some new family.
Yeah!
The door won’t open.
-We’re stuck!
Hi!
Hello!
Nice to meet you!
Hi!
-Hello!
It’s so nice to meet you!
Yes!
How was the flight?
Good?
So short.
We’re waiting for the van to pick us up here.
Alright.
We’ve been recording the whole trip here.
Oh!
We’re going to make a little video.
You can see our whole flight.
Yeah.
Thank you.
We have a lot of stuff.
It all seems to gets heavier every time.
Yeah, every time.
That is a big mall.
That’s the biggest mall.
In The Philippines.
Really?
-Really!
We’re going to the mall.
It’s a big mall.
Looks good.
Cheers!
So good to meet you!
Nice to meet you guys too.
So what kind of stuff do we have in there?
Leche flan, ice cream, some beans, like baby tapioca.
Tapioca.
Oh yeah.
We’ve only just figured out that it’s not “halo halo,”
it’s “halo halo”, which means “mix mix.”
So you have to halo halo it
before you can eat the halo halo.
Right.
Mix, mix.
Mix, mix, mix.
I just blew on it.
Okay, it’s not hot.
Sir Mix-a-Lot.
Anyone have a Kitchen Aid?
Okay, you going to try it?
Yup.
Let’s do this.
Mmm!
Whoa it’s such a crazy flavour.
Yeah.
This is going to sound ridiculous
but it tastes like purple.
Like you would expect purple to taste.
I like that description.
One of my favourite flavours.
Yeah.
Oops! Forgot to sign off.
We were having too much fun with Marc’s family.
Stay tuned for day 2 in Cebu.
