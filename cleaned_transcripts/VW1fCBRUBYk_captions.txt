Welcome to my new video, I am Harees Ameerali.
Currently here at Angeles City, Philippines
I'm here to see the Puning Hot Spring
We have seen Hot Spring back in Krabi Thailand.
Feel free to check out the video, I will add the link wihtin the description or the iCard
I'm about to go to the Puning Hot Spring under Korean Management
As it's their private property
I paid 3,500 Peso and  they'll need you to be in a group of 3 (minimum) to travel to the destination.
As they only take you within group and not solo so in-order to show you the destination I paid the amount for 3 people (10,500 Peso)
So there are tons of food here that's actually included within the package
So these are what we are about to eat and they had pork items I haven't taken it
So we have some fish, chicken and egg soup
Mostly people have said that their food is smelly and slightly off-taste
Based on what I had so far everything have been tasty
Sothere are no foul scent s it's same as any other fish finger
As most of these items are exported from here
As there is nothing unique about this Fish finger
And next comes chicken as it's something that any malayalees will like
As it's not spicy
As there are no strange scent or flavors
And next is veggies as it's just plain boiled veggies.
Don't be afraid of the food here
I'll explain more based on what I explore so this is my opinion that I see in person
We'll see what Bobby has to say
What you have to say?
Bobby: Well their food culture is different from ours
As we need  salt and spices but for them it won't be seen in their dishes
Their crunchy and crispy dishes are famos
And they have a couple of dishes made of pork etc but it's usually sweet due to the sauces
As most of us won't accept the sweet dishes
Their soup items are something that's common and famous
And it's usually acceptable for us
So that's what Bobby has to say based on his 11 years of experience.
So once we are done with food we'll go to the destination
As there is something related to volcanic ash or sand
We are done with the food and we are about to head to the location
and the vehicle is ready to take us to the destination
So our jeep is here, behind me
So lets go
So while traveling in the vehicle they'll give you a helmet
to protect your head if you bump into the metal frame of the vehicle
as it's a 4x4 off road journey
It's an awesome journey
SO next is their spa so lets go there
And when you are visiting the hot spring you'll have 3 stops
One being the base camp where you had the food and  the spa and the hot spring
As you can spend your time in the hot spring
As the spa uses special sand and they did say that it cures alot
And every vehicles are off-road capable and it's really within the Forrest area with no mobile coverage
As you will see some local tribal people around within sheds and smaller huts
As the vehicles are provided to them as well
We have a guide with us as he is the one who explains things for us
And even helping us move the camera
The type of land and sand is different here
When it rains the water raises to the point Iaimed
During that time you won't have access to this area
Even now they are giving restricted entry for tourists due to the fact that you are moving to tribal area
As you know that there are some doubtful areas so this is part of Korean Management
Good for blood circulation, body pain and joint pain as you will lay for 15 minutes
They say that it's the sand collected as volcanic ash/sand
So they will cover you with sand and it's like you are dead and being burried
This is really unique for us as they will also step on us.
I may not be able to explain when they treat me
Not sure what happens when they step on me
Anyways the sand and setting is clean and neat
So I changed my outfit and this is their uniform
So I am about to lay in the sand
The sand is really hot as there is quite a temperature form the bottom
