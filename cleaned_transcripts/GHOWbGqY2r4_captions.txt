forward open your eyes
[Music]
i can't fight dude i'm i'm a [ __ ] i
i'm a [ __ ] dude i don't even know how
to stand
at the beginning of a fight
you know i mean like when they're
yelling at you i just
[Applause]
i'm a [ __ ] dude
i can't fight dude if you don't know how
to fight here's the thing don't take
self-defense classes don't buy a gun
don't do anything just just scream
who's gonna find a guy screaming at the
top of his lungs
like right when he's about to punch you
just
[Applause]
who's gonna find a guy screaming like a
[ __ ]
i'll pull my pants down and start peeing
up
[Laughter]
i am a [ __ ] dude i don't care
you guys are laughing but you're
thinking to yourself that might work
[Applause]
i wish we could fight like monkeys man
when monkeys get mad they crap in their
hand and they throw it
how cool is that
who's gonna find a guy with a lump of
crap in his hair
think about it
the final stop right when it begins
it's like are you sure you want to do
this
it's a lot of corn i'll throw
no one's going to fight a guy with a
lump of crap in his hand
even a guy with a gun will be like hey
put that crap down
put the crap down no
i'll throw it
any new parents out there this is my
only suggestion right now this is the
only thing i can give you as another
parent is take a lot of pictures and
take a lot of video tape as much as you
can and actually every time your kid
goes mommy pick me up daddy care me pick
them up carry them don't look at them
girl you got legs walk don't do that
[ __ ]
because they grow up that fast and
there's gonna come a time where they
don't want you to pick him up anymore
and you're gonna miss those [ __ ] days
i'm gonna hold my son until he's 20. i
don't give a [ __ ]
we're gonna be at the mall my son's been
like dad this is ridiculous
it's ripping burp side
take a lot of video capture every moment
it's called evidence
everything that makes your son cry or be
sad get it on tape use it against them
the worst day of my son's life was his
first day of school
he didn't want to go to school kept
crying till three o'clock in the morning
crying all night i don't want it what is
good daddy
i always
[Music]
[Music]
go to
sleep it's three o'clock in the morning
going to bed baby you're gonna have fun
in school you get to learn things in
school you get to meet new friends in
school you get to play with your new
friends at recess you're gonna have fun
baby
daddy's gonna take you to school so why
are you scared i'm going to be there for
you
and then i was like oh [ __ ] i got to get
the camera
i got to get all this crying on tape
that way when he gets older and starts
talking [ __ ]
i got that tape
because you know how little boys are
when they're 16 they talk [ __ ] to their
dads it's like dad why are you with dick
all the time i go really and i pop the
tape in what about that
[ __ ] but that didn't happen i brought
him to his first day of school my son
grew up just like that right before my
eyes turned into a little man teacher
said his name he walked right past me i
tried to kiss him he did that matrix
[ __ ] on me
standing in the single file line like
this holding his backpack and these two
little boys that obviously went to
preschool together they're in the same
class and they run up behind my son this
is gonna be fun we're gonna have a
kindergarten we're gonna have fun
my son doesn't even know these kids but
he keeps looking at him trying to engage
in some type of conversation like yeah
this is gonna be fine
i'm gonna be your friend
look at my ting ting
i'm across the auditorium i'm recording
everything and he sees me so i mouth to
him i go i love you
i love you
and my son goes like this
what a dick right
and then the teacher goes all right
we're going to take your kids to class
and even if your kid starts crying don't
come with us because we're trying to
break that bond parents stay in the
auditorium i go all right now my son's
going to cry reality check daddy's got
to leave so i run up to my son i'm
trying to squeeze one tear out of this
[ __ ]
i'm saying mean [ __ ] too like daddy's
gotta go
that's a lot of scary people here
my son goes like this so what daddy
just go
get out of here
and i was like this
okay
you don't you don't have to say so loud
i just want you to know i made you a
sandwich
and i put gogurt in your backpack
and it's a caprese
and uh if you are still hungry daddy put
three dollars in your pocket so you're
gonna get
i leaned in and kissed him like this and
he put his little baby hand on my face
just like that so cute
and he goes move
he [ __ ] pushed my face
and walked out that door with those two
boys he just met in line and now they
think he's king [ __ ] cause he just
bitch-slapped his dad
so i stopped him you're not going to
punk me i don't give a [ __ ] if you're
