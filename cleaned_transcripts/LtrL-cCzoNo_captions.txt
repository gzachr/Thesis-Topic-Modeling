Hi everyone!
How are you guys?
we're doing part two
reacting to Jollibee commercials
our first video will be perfect pair
the second one will be parangal
and the third one will be choice
let's get into it are you ready
i'm ready are you sure
are we prepared got this yeah we're not
going to cry i'm not going to cry
no tear tear here.
we will see if she's going to cry
all right let's do this
so perfect pair. yes
what the heck
remember that yeah he did it to her what
i was so confused because she is
is that a different girl?
yeah this is
is that the same guy?
yeah same guy different girl though it's
his friend
oh that's what happened remember?
wait i'm confused i'm confused
what happened
okay so the first video
she doesn't get married to him she gets
married to someone else and he got whole
friend zone which hurt
and he basically ditched his friend who
they were literally perfect for each
other because they act literally the
same
for his girl crush and
that's it's like this little trifecta of
broken hearts
that stinks wait let's see there's still
time let's see hopefully he's not as
dumb as he has been
that's too much
so that's her friend yeah that's his
friend the other girl is his crush that
is his friend
that's a friend 
someone's gonna
i'm hoping 
now my heart isn't breaking for him
anymore
99 pesos - $2
that makes sense
all right
well what do you think that was a
happier ending i like that a lot i
thought i thought that guy's going to be
lonely at the end
oh yeah especially when she she probably
separated her himself
herself from just
that's a better plot twist than the
first one though i like that a lot
better i'm glad she got married so that
way he could
all right that was better that was
better that was better so
we're gonna go to
parangal (award)
no, what is it
tribute or award
oh tribute
all right so the second video let's watch it
let's go oh it's just two minutes
so this is after the
mother and the child. the valentine oh no please
don't cry
oh it's mother's day
oh yeah
happy mother's day to all the beautiful mothers out there
that's crazy
happy mother's day
and it is actually mother's day that was
that was a beautiful ending it was
beautiful we're lucky for our parents in
general our mothers worked so hard but
so do our fathers
but father's day is next month so we
contribute to that next one yeah
i just want to say before we move on
that i want to say thank you to my mom
she's a very
sweet caring loving beautiful person
that
she worked hard
i mean we saw i had my dad at home
he was there always taking care of us
loving us but
my mom works hard my mom always worked
hard
she always made sure that she was there
for everything thank you mommy or salamat mi (thank you mom in Filipino)
i just want to say happy birthday to my
mom
happy birthday
i love you and happy mother's day
you're my superwoman anyways so in the
philippines you know they're showing all
those like education and stuff in the
video right and the difference between
america and the philippines america has
like student loans
like you can borrow money from the
government but in the philippines like
you have to pay the full tuition fee
yeah and
you know that's why it's
educational in the Philippines is very big
for us
i mean education is important everywhere
just most of americans are lazy
i'm saying that as myself i
went to christian college for one
semester i never really
had a one i just i didn't see myself
pursuing anything that needed a college
degree so
i mean things that
i love and enjoy are things that i can
just gain experience on and
would be better to have experience in
and to learn by
hands-on experience rather than
schooling yeah in the philippines
schooling is very important you know
which is why you went to college so yeah
i mean that's
one of the way to get out of poverty
we are gonna go to the third video
it's gonna be
choice
ready?
i'm ready there's a lot of people
requesting this one i don't know if it's
gonna be good or not we shall see
you don't trust people who say that
sorry it's just
it's a no for me already
you are my one and only
I got a bad feeling
Yum burger. Yummy. They are yummy
is that the other guy? I don't know
oh no
hmm
no please no please
i got a horrible feeling
hold up
what do you think is gonna happen?
i don't know i don't know because she's
she's either gonna reject i mean it's
already bad from the start the fact that
they're both doing like boyfriend things
for her
no kidding
who's the actual boyfriend? I don't think either one is the boyfriend
oh
no
no
poor guy
at least they have jollibee
well
at least she made a choice and didn't
play them
oh no
that's
i'm sorry i judged you
there wasn't a lot of context there
though you can't judge me you guys are
good
wow
stick to the heart what happened so that
was probably her boyfriend before then
the four years ago wait so she
chose that guy?
she was with she probably didn't know no
that was in her past and she had been
dating him but then he passed away and
then she probably just blocked her heart
after everybody until she met that guy
at work so they it wasn't even in the
same time i don't think
it hurts!
dang two videos made me cry you guys are
good
oh why'd you have to make me cry
can't we do some laughing ones so so all
those six videos that we watch from the
first
reaction to second
what's gonna be your favorite one
the ones that don't make me cry
actually this one was a good one it broke
my heart i don't know
i'm still kind of
about it i like all of them but the
cheesy ones
