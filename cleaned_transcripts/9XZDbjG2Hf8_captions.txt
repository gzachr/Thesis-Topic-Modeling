So let's begin this episode by looking at Malaysia the Malaysia is divided into two parts Malaysian, Borneo and Peninsular
Malaysia Malaysia is a 45th most populated country in the world according to the world population
Review and that population is at thirty two point zero four million people the population density is ninety six point eight six people per square
kilometre and the total land area of Malaysia is
330 thousand eight hundred and three square kilometers the Philippines is what is called a unitary sovereign state and
island country in Southeast Asia
But the majority of Philippines population actually live on just eleven primary islands the population of the Philippines
currently sits at
106 million five hundred and ten thousand people and currently that makes the Philippines a twelfth most populated country in the entire world its
Population density is 311 point one two people per square
Kilometre the LAT area of the Philippines is three hundred and forty two thousand three hundred and fifty three square kilometers now
Let's get into the money of these two nations the currency in Malaysia is a Malaysian Ringgit and in the Philippines
They use the P so and when we take a look at stats from
2016 Malaysia expert at one hundred and eighty four billion dollars making it the 20th largest
exporter in the world and import one hundred and fifty six billion dollars
Malaysia's GDP is around two hundred ninety six point four billion dollars
And his GDP per capita is nine thousand five hundred and two dollars and sixty seven cents
So now let's look at the top exports of Malaysia and now the first one was integrated circuits at twenty five point six billion dollars
Then we have refined petroleum at ten point nine billion dollars and palm oil at eight point nine four billion
Malaysia stop imports also include integrated circuits that sit at eighteen point five billion dollars
and then refined petroleum at eleven point four billion dollars and
semiconductor devices at three point two nine billion dollars moving on to the dollars of the Philippines now so the Philippines is a
41st largest
export economy in the world their GDP is three hundred and four billion dollars and the GDP per capita in the Philippines is
Around seven thousand eight hundred dollars looking at the top experts of the Philippines now
Philippines have integrated circuits as its top at thirteen point six billion dollars
Then there's computers at four point four seven billion dollars and wood carpentry at two point seven eight billion dollars
the Philippines imports now also includes
Integrated circuits at the top at nine point five billion dollars cars are second at three point nine three billion dollars
And then refined petroleum is third at three point five six billion
now looking at the cost of living when we compare them to each other we take the capital cities of both countries and
Compare the cost of living so when we look at the cost of living in cholera umpire
Malaysia and compare it to the Manila in the Philippines
we see that food is 17% higher housing is two percent less clothing is seven percent more and
Transportation is thirty three percent higher personal care is 25 percent more expensive and entertainment is 9 percent more expensive
So the cost of living in Calamba is fourteen percent more expensive than in Manila Philippines
And now looking at the debt of these countries Philippines national. Debt is 125 billion dollars u.s.
and the debt per capita is one thousand thirteen dollars now Malaysia's national debt stood at
175 billion u.s.. Dollars so that concludes this side-by-side comparison of Malaysia and the Philippines
