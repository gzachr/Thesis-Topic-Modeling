hi this is Tim Tayag and this is the
foreigner's guide in how to participate
in a Filipino fiesta. Fiestas in the
Philippines are like sunrise there is
one every day we have a fiesta for Saints,
Jesus, baby Jesus, black Jesus, the black
baby Jesus, for carabaos and even
fiestas for rice, reenactment fiestas
fiestas for flowers we have fiestas for
just about anything you can think of so
in your trip to the Philippines it is
highly likely that you will be in one of
these fiestas and you might want to
learn what is acceptable behavior so
here's your quick guide to the proper
etiquette in a fiesta the first rule is
you gotta eat
fiestas revolve around two main things
the procession and food you can skip the
procession but you can't skip the food
unless you want to insult the whole town
and they will be insulted if you don't
eat their food some of the finer points
in eating in a fiesta are
don't make a face if the food looks or smells funny
something Filipino food doesn't really
smell good but it tastes really good for
example "tuyo" so don't judge the food
by the smell and you guys eat cheese
right? Fake it even if you don't like it.
Don't be the first in line in the buffet
have at least one person in front of you
and if somebody gives you a plate pass
it on to the next guy in behind you it's
just proper etiquette because you don't
want to look like what they call "patay gutom" google it do not eat the
last piece of food on the serving plate
that's called the Filipino piece nobody
is allowed to eat it that is saved for
the gods it's called the Filipino piece
also known as the piece of shame and
lastly accept the take out
when entering a Filipino home always
take your shoes off even if the host
tells you oh no it's okay you can keep
your shoes on don't believe it take
your shoes off it really annoys us
Filipinos when you come into our house
wearing those dirty shoes so leave them
at the door. wear sunscreen and keep your
shirt on please the heat will get to you
at some point but it doesn't give you
the right to take off that shirt
especially if you're really pale because
you're gonna blind a lot of people and
besides you want the other people to
enjoy the parade by keeping yourself
decent the only exception is if you're
part of the "ati-atihan" then by all means go
shirtless and smear your body with black
paint and lastly just drink and be merry
after all this is all about having fun
if you don't drink alcohol then don't go
to a fiesta when the Filipino offers you
a drink you better drink it up because
that is a test of your manliness you are
being judged by your ability to absorb
alcohol if a little girl can drink more
than you then you're gonna be a
laughingstock so I hope that helps and
now you know how to behave in a fiesta
