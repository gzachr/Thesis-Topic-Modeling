Hello, everyone. This is Mr. BulBul.
I shouldn't say bulbul..anyway.
(Finally) I came to the Philippines.
I left my house (in Korea) at around 4 PM.
Now it's 1:16 AM.
Yea..my flight was good.
That's why I like Philippine Airlines.
Terminal 2 is the best place in the Philippines.
Philippine Airlines provide meal inside the cabin
unlike other budget airlines.
 But it's been more than 6 hours (since I had dinner).
So I just came out (to find foods)
Everything closed, but I could find very small 
street style stores
Bread 25php, water 25php, total 50php.
Very simple but I like it.
Is it pandesal bread ?
It's Sunday now..No it's already Monday.
I go back to Korean on Thursday. So I have 3 nights.
Before I came here, I always improvised.
Local food, plutan, San Miguel, red horse...
But the concept of this trip is..
"Trying Korean foods in the Philippines".
Not localized Korean food but
the korean food that Koreans in the Phillipines
actually like to eat.
I googled and I could find a few places.
I can say the big title of this episode is
"Korean Tries Korean Foods in the Philippines"
Came here for Korean foods ?? Lol
because I came here without my wife.
My wife asked my father in law
to be with me during my staying.
He will come this place tomorrow
I also think it's a very good opportunity
(eventhough we are in the Philippines) I can give him some
chances to taste legit Korean foods.
See you tomorrow.
