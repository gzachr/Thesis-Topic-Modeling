good afternoon everyone and welcome back to manila  
uh today is actually a travel day for us so we 
have captured a flight this evening so today's a  
bit more of a chilled one because we don't really 
want to be walking around with our backpacks on  
because they're very heavy and we'll be absolutely 
violent in this heat so we've decided to come to  
the park uh and we've picked up a jollibee now 
we've seen jollibee absolutely everywhere and we  
asked what if we should try and what we should try 
and stuff and we've got a few different things to  
try so we were a bit curious as to why there were 
so many jolly bees and what they actually were  
and turns out they're like a fast food chain 
and they're way more popular in the philippines  
way way more popular than mcdonald's and 
kfc which is obviously around the globe  
tends to be more popular especially in the uk 
okay first of all before we get stuck into this  
we just want to say a massive thank you to all 
the support we've had on our channel so far since  
arriving in the philippines it has really blown up 
it is crazy how fast the reaction as well so like  
we posted the first video and within a couple of 
hours really yeah it just started taking off and  
it was insane it's nuts to see yeah it's all 
the comments as well we really appreciate  
all the comments we read and reply to every 
comment uh so we see all your recommendations  
all your like well wishes and things the 
recommendations that we've had mind-blowing  
there's so many some some some people have taken 
so much time to write their digital yeah there's  
like a couple of paragraphs of things to see and 
things to do and it is it's nice to see his name  
so yeah we just wanted to say a big 
thank you before we get stuck into this  
yeah but yeah should we just start with some 
fries with some surprise i guess nice and easy
oh they're salted well yeah very salty hmm
i don't want to make the initial comparison 
but they kind of remind me of mcdonald's chips  
the chips do yeah i think
chips are very much the same in 
most fast food restaurants you go to  
yeah i think the other things are 
going to be more of a comparison  
like more different yeah are we going to go for 
a bit should we go for a yummy yeah let's go for  
a young burger you could get a young burger a 
cheesy young burger or a cheese and bacon burger  
but we went for just the plain yum yeah oh no 
we went for the cheesy yum burger pretty good
this is gonna sound really silly the burger 
tastes like a proper burger well no like a  
not like a party sort of fast food burger no 
it's just like a really good ground beef burger  
mmm doesn't it it does but just like a thin 
it's so it's still thin like a party burger  
yeah it's still like i don't know you can 
kind of see you can kind of see the uh  
the difference between this burger 
and like a fast food builder but  
yeah you're right it tastes like a bar 
like a one-year-old barbecue almost yeah
i don't really think i don't eat at all
i'm impressed with that exactly me too it's good 
i'm gonna be having a jolly view all the time  
at this rate okay we've also picked up oh 
what's this rice okay so we've picked up um  
chicken joy meal chicken meal and i think there's 
rice in here so we got two pieces of chicken rice  
and this looks like a gravy are you meant 
to try the rice with the gravy i don't know
it's just rice again yeah it's 
just like fresh rice i guess
bear with us when we're doing this 
there's uh just fly he's playing about  
i think i'm just going to go for it just go for it
good that's really good have 
you tried it with the gravy no  
i'm going to rip some off egg oh yeah that is good
and dip some gravy and see
oh oh gosh oh gosh
oh that gravy's good the skin is like quite crispy 
but it's not too crispy and then there is quite a  
lot of meat in here as well i'm impressed so far 
let me try it with the gravy the gravy's so good
oh yeah you could taste that gravy straight away
if you're getting a jollibee well what i'm trying 
to think about this is the second thing i've tried  
and the gravy is banging i like how you can get 
so much variety like you can get obviously you  
can get your burger your chips your chicken but 
then rice as well that's not like a common thing  
you don't get that mcdonald's don't get it 
anywhere i've never seen rice anymore so yeah  
which brings us on to our next thing which 
is spaghetti you can actually get spaghetti  
we haven't even looked at this yeah be careful 
oh god oh it's got cheese on top too spaghetti  
in a fast food restaurant is unheard of i feel 
like in europe it's called jolly spaghetti where  
would you even get spaghetti like a strawberry is 
that stuff there's sausage in it like a hot dog
like uh
i think i'm gonna try the spaghetti on his 
own first oh he's going straight for a sausage  
yeah that sauce is good yeah yeah
oh my god that is delicious
it's like a tomato sauce but it's 
not your average tomato sauce  
okay this might not be messy this might not 
be nice it might be messy this will be messy
hmm
what a tomato sauce in a pasta 
we'd be used to taste like  
i do like pasta as well yeah 
we are big fans of pasta
that sausage is really nice 
i thought it was gonna have  
the texture of a hot dog sausage but it's softer
yeah i'm really impressed so far i'm not 
going to like me too like and we've seen  
that in the inside if you eat inside you get 
proper plates and proper knives and faults  
so it's almost like a fast food sit down meals 
restaurant yeah oh we still have something to try  
i'm happy with the uh with the rest to be honest  
just try it so the next thing we picked up was a 
chicken sandwich i think a chick a chicken witch  
that's a bunny oh it's massive yeah it's 
a brioche bun this time is it boneless  
i'm gonna presume it's born loss 
it'll be a bit weird if it wasn't  
a brioche bun let's go for it i guess 
oh you're just gonna have to go for it
that looks like a proper big bit 
of chicken and it's boneless too
like it's it's a full did you show it yeah it's 
like a full chicken it's not like a breast of  
chicken like throwing mcdonald's you've got 
like a chicken and it's like kind of like  
the same shape as like a burger would be but 
this is like a full full like chicken fried  
thing well that was a big bite i did order a 
tuna pie but i got given a peach and mango pie  
i think unless they've just put it in the wrong 
place it feels really crispy on the outside
i'm assuming it's like a dessert like uh it is 
a tuna pie oh it is oh they've just put it in  
one of those did you put in the wrong case 
it's like tuna almost sort of like a gravy  
it's got some carrots in it
that that made one oh yeah it does kind 
of look like this yeah this may be one of  
the best fast food things i've ever tried 
really because it's a big two no lover  
is that your favorite then you're gonna save the 
two knows your favorite out of all these one two  
three four five five things other chips six six
i'm gonna have to say it is tuna i'm gonna go 
for i think i'm impressed with the spaghetti  
and because you can't get it in any other fast 
food restaurants i'm definitely gonna go with the  
spaghetti and i think i'm also really surprised 
with the cheeseburger i'm going to say the sorry  
the young burger or the cheesy yum burger i think 
the cheesy yum burger might be second those are my  
two favorites i'm gonna say the tuna pie and the 
cheesy hamburger yeah the cheese yeah definitely  
don't think this will be our last oh 100 i'm 
gonna i'm gonna eat this all the time we need  
some sort of traditional filipino foods though 
to try as well yeah we have been recommended some  
i feel like we need more recommendations 
on where to try it more than what to try
i don't know if you could hear the leaf blow 
in the background i hope it's not too loud  
but yeah i'm really impressed i'm excited to tuck 
into this and finish it all off to be honest we  
are heading to the airport because we have got 
a flight tonight we are really excited to carry  
on exploring the philippines we don't know how 
long we're going to be here from no not sure  
we have a one month free visa so we'll 
probably definitely be here for a month  
and then we'll just see how it goes from there i 
think the amount of recommendations we've had we  
aren't going to be able to do them all in a month 
so we might have to extend try and extend and  
carry on exploring the guesswork yeah but we'll 
see yeah but for now thank you so much thanks  
for watching this has been our jollibee first 
time trying yeah we'll see you again next time
you
