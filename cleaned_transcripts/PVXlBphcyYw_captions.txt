Climate change is a very real and present
threat to our everyday reality.
In December of 2016 my town was hit
by super typhoon, Nock-ten.
When the storm hit, it was disastrous.
It was an overnight disaster
that it displaced about 1000 homes.
It destroyed 80% of agricultural land.
And it's not a one time thing.
We have typhoons that
hit our town every single year.
But this one wasâ€“ it was extremely bad
because everyone was impacted
regardless of what they did,
where they came from, who they were.
You know, the day
after it was just this unrelenting
sunlight and no shade, no trees.
And it was absolutely disastrous.
And most of the houses were gone.
It was just a flat expanse,
which is something
you would rarely see in my hometown.
And this super typhoon
was kind of a moment that,
where it clicked for us
that the climate crisis
was impacting our communities
and there was a
need to adapt to these changing climates
and these extreme weather conditions.
And we needed to do something immediately
or else we would risk getting left behind
or losing everything we had.
What we're trying to do
is to make sure that farmers are ready
for the climate crisis and ready to adapt
to the fact that our soils are degrading
and make sure that not only are
they prepared for the climate crisis,
but they can also bounce back
better, recover easier.
And not just that, but also be part of the
stewardship to protect our landscapes
and make sure that we can regenerate
those lands
and reforest anything
that's been lost in the previous storms.
So we work with farmers,
we give them cocoa
trees, which is much more high value,
and we help them build agro-forests,
teach them about regenerative farming
practices and sustainable agriculture
so that they can regenerate soils,
know how to grow organically
and also understand the finance
and entrepreneurial side of farming.
So it's really helping them
start off from the farm planning stage
all the way to post-harvest.
It's just like a very slow, long term
process of working with these communities
to make sure that they understand
the enormity of the climate crisis
and make sure
that they're prepared for it.
We're a very small group.
There's only four employees,
but we are working with over 200 farmers
and we planted over 85,000 trees
over a span of 85 hectares of land.
Our brand is called The Cacao Project
and our logo is basically
you can see cacao
kind of pods, all of these different
colors, and it features our landscapes.
And it kind of helps show people
what these landscapes are
and kind of shows a story of how
we're regenerating these lands and helping
farmers become stewards to our environment
as much as just recovering.
Thinking innovatively
doesn't have to be this cool
new invention
or this crazy idea that comes all at once.
It can be a slow process
and it can start locally, and
it actually begins with existing ideas.
It's just adapting that
and transitioning it into new times
and these different ideas and contexts
that are coming out of our rapidly
changing issues today.
Young
people can definitely make a difference
even in communities like mine,
which are very traditional,
and you can actually work
and have a lot more
intergenerational collaboration
with elders and,
you know , using that old knowledge
to translate for young people.
Because it's also our role to carry
the torch of traditional knowledge
and our cultures in nature preservation.
Absolutely, anyone can do it.
But the goal is that we create this model
that people can replicate
throughout the country
and in different parts of the world.
