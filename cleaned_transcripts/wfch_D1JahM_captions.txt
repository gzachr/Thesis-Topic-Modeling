We're already in Oslob...
where we're going to dive with Whale Sharks.
But first, we stopped to have breakfast...
It's included on our tour.
Both the transfer from Badian and breakfast.
So we're having...
Mango sticky rice...
I got completely addicted to it in Thailand
where it's served with coconut milk.
Here it's served with hot chocolate.
I'm not much a hot chocolate fan...
But Gene, our tour guide, said I had to taste it
Here it goes...
Try it...
Is it good?
100% chocolate...
too sweet...
But I think you're gonna like it...
'gonna try it...
We're waiting for our boat...
ready to go
we've got our life vest
and fins, rent them
so you can dive deep in this salty water
and... we're here waiting for our turn
we're the #150
they called us a while ago
but Gene, our Island Trek tour guide
got us a private boat... way cooler
'cause the boats take lots of people.
This way we're more comfortable
we brought our Lowepro backpack with our gear and
at least we know nobody's gonna mess with our stuff.
Oslob isn't just known for the Whale Sharks.
It also has beautiful white sands beaches.
Everybody talks about Sumilan Island
for its famous sandbar
that appears in low tide.
Despite the wind and the rush hour...
we still went to discover another Philippine's paradise.
We've just arrived at Sumilan Island...
and even though it's high tide
and there isn't a lot of sand...
look at the color of this water!!
I already claimed this piece of land!
Tumalog falls were the most beautiful waterfalls I've seen in the Philippines
When we arrived, we saw only a couple there
They took some photos and left...
they didn't even try the water.
Wonder why?
Our tour guide said this fall wasn't too touristic
because the water was cold.
I had an amazing time!
So quiet...
We stayed a bit...
and then we went for lunch.
It's time to get back to our resort...
we have a one hour and a half car trip ahead
to get back to Badian.
And these were
for me, the best tours in Cebu
to get to know the main attractions.
I hope you guys enjoyed this video!
