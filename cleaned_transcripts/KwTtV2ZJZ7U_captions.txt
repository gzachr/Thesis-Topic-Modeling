[Eating comes first!
The members are out to eat lunch]
We'll eat
whatever you order!
[(It's up to me now.)]
[But...]
[Why is there so much food?]
[There's still more!]
Did you buy the whole place?
[IDOL TRUCK in the Philippines Ep. 2
Let's get started!]
[The Class of Dara's Everlasting Beauty]
- Sandara noona!
- Yeah?
Thank goodness!
[Seeing Dara's popularity
cheered up the members]
[(Can you all see her halo...?)]
I didn't appear in any Philippines show
for over 10 years,
but how did they know me...?
No!
Of course they could know you!
Even when I'm in the US or Dubai,
it's always the same!
Many Filipinos live there.
Oh~
[(What do you know?)]
You're saying
your looks didn't change at all...
[That was her big picture...!]
[The boys were slow to catch
what she wanted to emphasize]
We were too slow to understand...
[But you really didn't change!]
[Doesn't look any different
from 20 years ago]
You're so popular here,
you should visit only with your fiance.
[To protect your travel mates...]
[IDOL TRUCK experiences local food! /
Eating comes first!
The members are out to eat lunch]
[So pretty!]
[It's much cooler in the restaurant]
[Welcome to your first
Philippines restaurant!]
[Enjoy all sorts of fresh
seafood & fruit here!]
[A buffet to enjoy unlimited food]
- Wow!
- It's alive!
[Big and fresh seafood]
[Dara's the expert /
The members ask her to order]
[(It's up to me now.)]
[Dara orders without hesitation!]
[What will they eat?]
The food here,
are not traditional food, right?
[Food from all over the world!]
Fusion?
Yeah, so they suit Korean taste too.
[Understood]
[Here's our menu!]
[The dishes arrive in order]
They keep arriving!
[Meat, fish, chicken, anything you want!]
[High quality dishes that Dara recommends]
Thank you!
Let's enjoy!
If we eat this,
[We can find out what
the local people like to eat!]
[(Roger that)]
[But first, let's enjoy!]
[Filipino food that's perfect for Koreans]
[The members are eating so well]
Dara...
Did you buy the whole place?
[More / Menu]
[Endless arrival of food]
[Generous /
This is how Sandara orders for others!]
I think
I've never ordered
so much food in my life!
But I always order like this.
Whenever you come here?
Yeah, and all my friends are big eaters.
We got everything, right?
[But... Always be prepared for anything..]
[Nope]
[Laughing at Dara's scale]
[1st day of wishing for Dara's Tour]
[New items to sell?]
I think we could sell K-food, too!
[Because Filipinos enjoy foreign cuisine!]
I think kimchi would be the most popular.
As I was eating, I thought
'Hmm? Kimchi would be so good with this.'
[(Meat with kimchi is) / (the best)]
[In fact /
Kimchi is popular in the Philippines]
[WIROFOOD Instant Kimchi Kit /
Make your own kimchi in 5 min,
just by adding water!]
This place, and in the market,
[We saw a lot of K-FOOD in the Philippines]
[Depending on the sales today or tomorrow,
let's see if we can sell K-FOOD!]
[DinDin's suggestion /
Let's sell at the right moment!]
[How will their business go?]
[1st meeting for their business! /
At a Korean brand coffee shop]
[Team Philippines met
to discuss their first sales]
How should we sell? I'm worried...
[(Detective)]
I heard Team Busan's strategy.
[(curious)]
They made flyers.
And distributed the flyers.
[Team Busan's strategy : Flyer marketing]
[So /
What's the strategy of Team Philippines?]
[What can / we do?]
1+1?
[1+1 /
Maknae's ultimate strategy?]
[(teasing) / Just give everything away
to get it over with?]
[(dumbfounded) /
Feeling unfair and unjust]
[(So fun to look at them
fooling around!)]
That would make us a jerk!
It would make us look like
we don't want to work too long!
[Sharing his opinion /
made him the victim of teasing]
[Slight improvement /
Let's sell 2+1!]
[(2+1...)]
[(How is 2+1 any different from 1+1?)]
[The King of Nego /
DinDin's Lecture on How to Sell]
[(idea) / We can sell
the less popular items for 2+1]
[Definitely the King of Nego /
That's a GOOD strategy]
[(See how experienced I am?)]
[Maknae JONGHYEON didn't give up yet]
Or!
[Or / what?]
[(Developing his idea)]
[Giving a freebie for buying 2]
But the products are
from different companies!
[(Oh yeah... Sry)]
But among the 20 brands,
how many products do we have to sell?
Is it like thousands?
Nah~
If we have to sell that much,
we have to file a suit.
[Sue the staff with the Office of Labor]
I heard that for each product,
we have max 20.
[Around / 400 items to sell]
[(Really? That's quite a lot!)]
Then we should sell 1+1!
[(Are you kidding me?)]
[(I'm embarrassed, I need coffee...)]
[(Here's your coffee)]
Hello.
[Korean]
Hello.
[(Oh!) / The cafe owner is Korean!]
Oh, you're Korean.
It's so nice to meet Koreans
in a foreign country.
We feel that too!
[How long have you been
doing business in the Philippines?]
I came here around 15 years ago...
[The grand senior(?) of business]
[Amazed / Wow]
This place is so big, you're so successful!
What's the average number
of customers per day?
A lot!
[(Proud sunbae) /
Thanks to K-POP, he has many customers]
[Interrogation]
Excuse me for asking, but...
[(Excuse me very much)]
How much do you make a month...?
[(woah)]
[Don't be mistaken /
I just want to ask for his advice]
[But it's the most curious one!]
I make around (Privacy Protection)....
[So / Amazing]
A month?
Woah...
[(He really is successful...)]
Like Cha Mu Sik...
[Wanna die?]
[(Not Cha Mu Sik) /
How did you promote?]
[Cafe Owner's TIP /
Promote that they're K-Brand products]
We should promote they're from Korea.
[...I wonder]
[(Yeah?)]
[(obsessed)]
In Korea, there are many 2+1 promotions.
Will this work in the Philippines, too?
I also do that for an event sometimes.
[(A)(h)(a)]
If it's your birthday,
[we provide a cake]
[(I love that)]
Birthday event sounds good!
Give 10 products if it's your B-day!
[(What is that!)]
[Which customer will enjoy
the birthday event?]
[IDOL TRUCK celebrates your special days]
[X Fake / Let's make our poster for events
/ Poster to put up on their sales spot]
[Poster to promote the event!]
I'm terrible at drawing...
[drawing / drawing]
Jinwoo is drawing something artistic.
[Revealed in 1 min 31 sec /
Guess what he's drawing!]
[Working so / hard]
This is how you spell?
[Is it ARon?]
[Not Aron, it's Aaron]
[(fixing)]
[In Eng / Writing down JONG HYUN]
[(Is this right?) / JONG HYUN?]
[Not JONG HYUN, it's JONGHYEON]
eon?
Change how you spell!
[(...Excuse me?)]
That's how I spelled all my life.
[Despite his teasing /
JONGHYEON continues making his poster]
I think you're the best at drawing.
....This is?
That's an A+ among here.
[(Drawing posters reminds me of...)]
[The effort and love of our fans]
But we suck(?) at this.
[(Looking for an artist)]
Unlike our fans...
[Clenching her teeth /
Trying her best despite her skills]
But isn't hand-made too old-fashioned?
[All of a sudden? /
(Woah~ calm down)]
Let's just use our phones
and start a viral promotion!
[(Main Model)]
I'll take a picture of you carrying a bag.
[Making you curious]
Why is Dara in the Philippines with a bag?
[(What the)]
[(model) / (photographer) /
(They really did)]
[Viral promotion tailored to the region]
[Who's better? Let's see! / End of drawing
/ Let's see the members' posters!]
[(Not confident)]
[Let's check out DinDin's poster!]
[Ta / da]
[A poster emphasizing 2+1]
[Let's check out Jinwoo's!]
[(Explaining)]
Idol Truck! This is the truck.
[Quite a childish picture...]
[So what's the theme?]
[Islands in the Philippines /
Truck running with the Philippines inside]
[Stylish]
(The title) Running with the Philippines
sounds good!
[Limited to Idol Truck /
He has good expressions!]
Mine's just...
This.
[Aaron's final work is?]
[Simple poster, emphasizing 80% discount]
That 80% is so eye-catching.
[shy]
And the 5 of us...
[Stick people for a neat finish]
[Maknae JONGHYEON's A+ masterpiece]
He drew all of us!
[(Sandara) (DinDin) (Jinwoo) (Aaron) (Me)/
Look at the striking characteristics!]
[It is good, but]
That's our best drawing...
[A bit shameful quality...]
Since you got all the other information,
I just wrote in Filipino language.
[(100% customized)]
Welcome! Buy K-Products.
[Korean + Tagalog /
She also wrote HELLO in 2 languages]
[Clumsy(?) but neat posters
are all complete!]
[Finding the spot to sell / serious]
The spot to sell today is...
[(serious)]
[What will he tell us?]
This is a bit like a jerk, but...
Where there's many people?
[To stimulate people's desire to buy!]
[No ethics]
For example, in front of a shopping mall..
People shopping for makeup
would see us and come!
[(perfect) / (duo)]
[80% sale]
Ours would be cheaper.
[This is for all the Filipino customers!]
Good for all of us!
But the shopping mall sellers
would be angry.
How about just for today?
[Whether this works /
Let's go a big shopping center]
[The 1st Spot to Sell!]
[Next Episode /
MARQUEE MALL in Angeles, Philippines]
[Sell all the K-PRODUCTS]
[Will they successfully sell everything?]
[It was from this moment /
that something went wrong...]
Just when we're about to sell,
it started to rain!
[Mental breakdown even before the start]
[(hurry) / (hurry)]
[A tent to cope with the
unexpected situation]
[Will we be able to sell today?]
Should I tell them we're shooting?
[Aaron makes an announcement]
[(Oh! Something's up)]
[While he was making his announcement...]
[He needs to tell them they're open /
but the mic isn't working]
[Mic]
It went off!
I wanna go home...
[A mess from the start /
What will happen to Team Philippines?]
