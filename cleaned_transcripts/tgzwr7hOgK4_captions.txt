this week yes but but uh so we went out to the  
stores yesterday and uh we're looking for some 
plastic eggs and all this other stuff and then  
honeybelle  thought huh well i guess we're just 
not going to do easter this year yeah because  
we went to the other store and then another store 
there's none nothing at any of the stores however  
i tried to remind her that uh traditional 
easter had nothing to do with plastic eggs  
we're doing it the old fashioned way we hard 
boiled a whole bunch of eggs and we couldn't find  
any dye so we're gonna color we're gonna paint and 
color these suckers that is that's all that's in  
there nope oh okay who was gonna say i thought 
there was more all right so what we have is
some brush and detail markers with 
fine points and brushes at the other  
side so we can kind of paint and then uh 
for a little pizzazz pizzazz some glitter  
and metallic plastic shake it up to get the paint
