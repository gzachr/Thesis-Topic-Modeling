what a nice dish thank you so much ellen v for 
requesting this uh dish i ate it once or twice  
a long time ago but i remember it was really 
good but i never made it myself so today i'm  
gonna try making kinilaw na isda with tuna so 
according to the recipe i need a very fresh tuna  
that can be eaten raw like sashimi style so now 
i'm on my way to the fish market where they sell  
really good quality fish and let's 
see if they have the tuna guys
um
mark
so we got the fish so this is an amazing 
store guys we can buy any kind of fish here  
and uh everything is super fresh
sige mag luluto tayo is a 
really good piece of fresh
tuna
look at that so when i look at the recipe the 
size looks like this i hope it's all right  
so i cut all the tuna like this and i'm gonna add 
some suka diba okay so in the meantime i want to  
show you a little bit of the city rotterdam 
it's a beautiful city so um please enjoy
so i'd like to show you a little bit of 
rotterdam behind me you can see a famous bridge  
erasmus bridge and this is the boulevard
so and now we're closer to the bridge
hope you enjoyed it right unfortunately 
i don't have a red onion today so i  
have to use white onion instead 
chopping the onions very fine  
not sure if this is needed but 
i'm gonna add one clove of garlic  
as well i'm not gonna make it too 
spicy today so i'm going to use  
half labuyo okay so the vinegar is 
making the tuna a little bit white
so if i'm doing anything wrong just let me know 
okay just put down your comments because i'm  
learning this from you so i drain most of the 
vinegar it's just contain sugar left okay maybe  
because otherwise it becomes too much so now i'm 
gonna add a little bit of sea salt in quite a bit  
okay i think it's time to add all the 
ingredients now so i'm adding the luya
one
so on the recipe i saw that i can also add 
a little bit of mayonnaise i'm gonna add  
a little bit of mayonnaise which reminds me 
of sisig so now let's mix this all together
let me guess you need to eat this with rice
let's taste it i'm super excited i'm really 
curious how this will taste okay let's try guys  
tuna  
wow super set up very nice the flavor and texture 
is really intense it's like a little bit similar  
to sisig but then raw i think so i'm really 
curious to your comments this time stay tuned  
for uh bulalo and lumpiang shanghai coming soon 
and i'll see you next time with more filipino food
