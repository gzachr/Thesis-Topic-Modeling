hey friends Mike and Jess here and welcome to 
Regeneration Nation TV today we are reacting to  
a video by Almira lat who is the bride in this 
video This is called he knows it's an original  
wedding song performed at by her at her wedding 
like what this is this is incredible we reacted  
uh not too long ago to Filipino man A Brave 
Filipino man sings to his wife at her wake um  
it said funeral but we later came to found out I 
was it was at her wake so it was beautiful it was  
uh Indescribable how just he was able to do that 
you know like I'm having a hard time finding words  
for it because I I related it to how I would 
be able to function in that situation and it  
was just it was so hard for me to to Fathom being 
able to do that like he he's a very strong person  
for being being able to do that um there's a lot 
of different things that you guys speculated in  
that video of like maybe they sung together maybe 
this was her last wish maybe you know there was a  
lot of different things and no matter which one 
of them is true I still it's just I have a very  
hard time not letting my emotions take hold of 
me in those situations and then this one came  
up a few people recommended this to us and I was 
like I I just remember how me and you were we've  
been married for 16 years and I just remember us 
both crying uncontrollably I was I was a balling  
mess as she's walking down the aisle I see her 
just balling and then I started crying and I was  
just like trying to go through the whole ceremony 
and I couldn't stop crying cuz it's just tears  
of joy you know tears of joy and just being so 
happy in that moment and it's just I don't know  
it was just such a beautiful moment so for her 
to be able to sing this as she's walking down  
the aisle like I don't I have no idea I have no 
idea how this is going to be possible yeah like  
I I'm excited to see it because I love weddings 
I love the wedding dresses I love everything  
about love I love it so I'm excited to see this 
and just enjoy the moment with them I knew that  
you would be very excited for it I am probably 
going to cry because I I cry about weird stuff  
man okay especially when it's happy moments like 
this I've cried at every wedding that I've went  
to because there just beautiful yeah happy of 
course I can't control them so who knows we'll  
see what's going to happen with this we will 
leave links for the original video for almira's  
uh Channel down in the description go and support 
her directly and yeah let's get into this let's  
do it already yeah this was me on our wedding day 
definitely all me I got to try to right there oh  
it's such a like he's so filled with happiness 
and joy but if you like if you took him and  
put him in another setting and saw him crying 
like this you would immediately think that he's  
devastated by something but it's not it's such 
an amazing feeling that you're feeling inside  
in that moment and you just it's hard to express 
it in any other ways and and the tears just flow  
on their own it's not like you're trying to cry 
you're actually trying everything you can to hold  
it back you want to be strong in that moment 
you want to just you know everybody's taking  
pictures and you don't want to ruin the pictures 
these make the pictures though yeah this is what  
always gets me at weddings too is because you see 
the groom crying and it's just an emotional part
this sounds like it could be a Disney song 
it does she has a beautiful voice she has  
like that Disney princess voice sound to 
her and this song especially the way that  
it's flowing and the instrumentals 
it could totally you could tell me  
that this is from a Disney movie and 
I would believe you definitely believe
it
man what a beautifully Written song beautiful 
and it's perfect for this moment it's absolutely  
perfect for this moment this is everything 
that you would want to say on this day of  
all days it's like wow wow it's just like 
a fairy tale it is like a fairy tale it is  
L like a fairy tale she's doing such a good 
job like I don't know if she's a performer  
of some type she has to be because she's 
doing an amazing job I always talk about  
it like when the performer is able to use 
their body language along with their vocal  
power their vocal technique but she's she's 
just crispy not her voice I'm talking about  
her body language right now she conveys so 
much emotion with her body language right now
wow that was beautiful wow and now we get to 
see her walk down that was absolutely beautiful  
stunning it's a beautiful venue that they have as 
well for this moment like wow wow wow wow that was  
incredible that was very special and they're going 
to have that for the rest of their lives they did  
such a good job with the filming of that as well 
and making sure that everything all the people  
that were there were all taken into account in 
that moment and the bride in the groom there was  
such a focus on the groom and his reaction to 
it and then just the walk down that's like the  
most beautiful part of a wedding of seeing the 
bride everybody goes to look at her but I feel  
like everybody forgets about the groom sometimes 
but there's always that awesome camera man who's  
focused on the groom when she's coming out and 
they get the best shots ever cuz it's just it's  
almost like there's all those people there but all 
she could see was him and all he could see was her  
yes and you could see it it was so beautiful cuz 
he didn't he never left her eyes you could you  
could see that every time you're looking at him 
it was super sweet but what an ultimate Testament  
because for me getting married you get into a 
foundation where where God is the center of it  
and the reason that you get married you say 
those vows um through thick and through thin  
um for better for worse till death do us part 
it's um when she was saying that uh we'll have  
forever and salvation I just love that because 
it's like this this this world is temporary this  
life is temporary but it's one thing to find 
your soulmate and know that forever is just  
it it's it like that's going to be us and it's 
very romantic and it's very just it just shakes  
your emotions from the inside out just that that 
ultimate Testament of love and professing that in  
front of the people that you love and I could 
go on for days I should probably plan weddings  
I mean honestly that was the ultimate Testament 
to their love for their love for their Lord and  
Savior like everything it just had everything 
it was talking about how they've been through  
they've both made mistakes they've been through 
the tough times and he's helped them get through  
it and they're going to serve through him 
for all time and just it was just such a  
beautifully Written song most people are lucky 
to have their song you know their soundtrack to  
their relationship you know we have quite a few 
of them and it seems like every single year we  
hear a new song and we're like oh this is our 
song This is Our Song and this is our song too  
and by this time we have a whole album of songs 
that we relate to our relationship and we love  
to listen to and every time they come on we just 
immediately look at each other but this song like  
this is y'all's song this is literally y'all's 
song and it's so beautiful it is that's such a  
beautiful thing it's originally yours written with 
a few words that you wrote yourself you know for  
your turned into something by a professional but 
still you had your hands in that and you got to  
perform it to your husband on your walk down and 
it's just this is going to go on to become other  
people's song yeah and their relationship and 
that's just it's it was so beautiful it was was  
so beautiful the camera work was amazing yeah it 
was it was just oh man I love she definitely has  
to be a performer or something she's got that just 
that quality about her like you were saying she's  
very good at putting out that emotion of whatever 
she's singing and obviously that was a Proof like  
that was the love for uh God at the same time 
for finding her soulmate and being the reason  
that they're together you know and and the thing 
that they have their relationship based under and  
their love for each other but I just was beautiful 
she has an amazingly beautiful voice and just for  
her to share that Talent with us and and the 
fact that this is filmed and put on YouTube  
I very I feel very fortunate to have seen it cuz 
that's a that's a very private moment you know and  
it's beautiful and sometimes people don't want 
to share that and I think it's beautiful that  
she did share that so yeah that was absolutely 
beautiful like I would like to think that uh she  
maybe had a few people audition to sing that and 
so she could just walk down the aisle and she's  
like you know what I'm going to do this no one 
could do it better nobody could do better I'm  
that good because you are that was amazing you 
did so good you literally sounded like a Disney  
princess she did it was it was a magical moment 
it looked it sounded like a Disney movie like the  
part in a Disney movie at the end where they all 
live happily ever after but yeah that could have  
been in a Disney movie you're right it was you 
couldn't have found anybody to perform it better  
than she just did and the fact that you were the 
bride I don't know it was just so perfect I can't  
say enough great things about this video that was 
absolutely amazing that was absolutely beautiful
