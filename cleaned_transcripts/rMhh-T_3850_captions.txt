hi guys this is vincent from vincent's 
korean class and i'm a korean and i'm a  
korean language teacher uh one of my students 
rick asked me to share my thoughts about  
this issue about believability of tiktok 
approach she had rising sun flag tattoo  
the flag is used by japanese 
military during second world war  
and it's traumatizing korean people korea was 
colonized by japan and so many people were  
killed and raped and tortured by japanese 
military and that is just historical fact
so i understand it i 
personally don't like the flag
it's not because i hate japan it's because the 
flag is used by the military that made war crime  
i understand korean people being upset if you wear 
a nachi uniform imprint holocaust of holocaust  
victim of course they're going to be upset they're 
going to be angry but what i want to talk about  
today is most of korean people's mentality about 
the philippines when i hear about this issue  
i was not upset about the flag tattoo because 
the past is the past even though i i don't  
like the flag many people don't know about the 
black with the history so they are not meant to  
make korean people upset and i'm sure that 
i didn't know about the black because japan  
also gonna colonize the philippines as well 
the thing but the thing that made me upset  
was the reaction of koreans i don't want 
to discuss about if bella is wrong or right  
or already many of youtubers are discussing about 
that so i don't want to discover some of that
but let's just say she's wrong but why 
korean people should blame the philippines
instead of blaming one individual why korean 
people should insert filipino people's skin color
instead of talking about the historical fact  
why korean people talking [ __ ] about philippines 
poor economy korea was more poor country in the  
past the philippine was the one of richest country 
in though not in the world or in asia i mean yeah
all the recent korean people talking 
[ __ ] about philippines the country  
is because korean people are looking down on 
philippines and pinoys i love the philippines  
i have personal history with the philippines 
i am planning to move to the philippines  
i'm a language teacher and many of my students 
are filipino so if the philippines loves korea  
and korean language or korean culture my business 
is gonna be better my life gonna be better when i  
move to the philippines my life's gonna be easier 
when i do my business it's gonna be easier but
i decide to unveil every everything 
because i felt so sad and guilty  
when philippine people were crazy about korean 
food and k drama and all the korean culture  
when they are consuming korean culture and product  
meanwhile korean people look down on the 
philippines and exploiting filipino people  
when i was in the philippines i went to a 
korean restaurant which owned by korean lady  
but the waiting staff was a filipino i hear the 
conversation between filipino filipino workers  
and the lady korean lady they spoke in korean but 
the filipino guy saw korean was not really good
when the korean lady called the 
workers she never called the name  
just yeah which is badass and other swear words
and when she talking to her 
colleagues her korean colleague
after i translated what she said was look 
at how filipino pasta is working no wonder  
why they are poor they have slave genetics 
what the [ __ ] is this what the hell is this
i immediately stopped eating and pretend 
time to korean i just spoke english and i  
got out of the restaurant it was disgusting and 
i decided to never go to korean restaurant again  
when i say korean honestly it's a generic 
mindset in korea it's just common thing honestly  
it's just common thing just it's just not 
few people's behavior if someone married  
the philippine ago they think the guy bought the 
call from paid arranged marriage broker company
when i suffered because of korean army the 
philippines helped me a lot and i'm always  
on filipino side i'm always on believing aside 
because filipino helped me a lot that's why  
i'm talking all these stories that's why i'm 
talking to all my friends in the philippines  
please do not like korea anymore it's your choice 
to watch korean drama movie eating korean food and  
consuming korean product but korean people 
would never appreciate to you another filipinos  
they are actually branded to filipino people as 
a career as a korean person i deeply apologize  
to philippian people i'm really sorry too i'm 
sorry i'm very sorry about all the comments and  
hating speech and all the comments about dark 
skin color and filipino economy they were talking  
[ __ ] about the philippines i'm really sorry 
about that and yeah filipino they don't hate it
