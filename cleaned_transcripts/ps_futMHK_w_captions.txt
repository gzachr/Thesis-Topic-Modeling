It's the same banana
Filipino, European, whatever
- No
No, you have tiny bananas
Gelo: What?!

Gelo: We're average
Hi guys! Today we're trying something new
We have with us two of the most beautiful ladies and influencers in Abu Dhabi
And today, they're going to try Filipino food
So let's get started
(intro song)
Hi, my name is Dana

And I'm a fitness trainer based in Abu Dhabi too
Never
- I did, many times
Gelo: So what's your favorite ones?
So, as I've told you earlier, I have three favorites
I think you would love them
Number one is Lumpia, that's like similar to spring rolls
Probably you've tried something like that
- Of course
Sticky rice
Did you try that?
Is it like fried rice?
No, it's sticky with like coconut milk, sugar - a lot of sugar
I've never tried
And third thing is Adobo
It's like a dish that you'd die for
But I don't know how to explain or what is it
I just know it's good
Okay
- Okay, bread looks good
What is this?
Bread and Cheese Whiz
Cheese Whiz? Is it 'Wheez?'
- Cheese Whiz
Cheese Louise
Oh, wow
The bread looks good
The bread - isn't this Filipino bread?
The bread is called Pandesal
Okay
This is one of the most famous breakfast food in the Philippines
Wow
Oh wow, it's hot
It's hot
This is really good
This is REALLY good
So this is, for me, five
Adnan would love this
Oh my god, we have something similar in Serbia
These are like similar to our noodles
Noodles?
Oh noodles - sorry, donuts
I'm like, 'which noodles?'
I love the bread, but the cheese is like
The bread, it's amazing. I love it
The cheese, let me try
I feel like this cheese is for sandwich
- Okay, I don't want to get full from the bread but 5
5, right?
- Yeah
I would say bread is 5. The cheese it's like good
Nothing different
- I'm not a big fan of the cheese
Same
Yeah, it's like I would definitely put it in my sandwich
Me too
Gelo: So the next food we'll bring you is from one of the most famous fast food chains
Fried chicken
Jolly?
Jollibee?
Gelo: Yes, Jollibee
Anything fried chicken?
- I've never tried it, but I want to try it so bad
Is there fried chicken at the end of the day?
I'm happy
- Dana, I wanted for so long to try this
Is this your cheat day by the way?
This is my like, yeah, cheat day
This is like Dana's thing, fried food
Oh my god, yes
Yes
I'm supposed to have lunch after this with Hisham, but poor Hisham
- Oh my god
Ah, this is sharing? Okay
I'm joking
She wanted it only for herself
Ta da
It looks so good
My type of food. Fried food
What is this?
- What is this?
Yobi: Rice, that's rice
This is rice?
Should we try rice?
Yobi: And gravy
So I just take the whole piece of chicken?
Gelo: Yeah, yeah sure
And then I pour
Gelo: You don't have to finish everything
Ah
Why?
Why?
How do you do this (eating with a spoon)?
Gelo: Ah wait, no no
I don't know
Gelo: They're not used to using spoons
I don't know how to use a spoon
Can I have a knife?
Guys, I love the chicken, I love the rice
I'm worried, I don't want to try the sauce
Dana, we have to have a dance, a good food dance
- Exactly
Like this?
I really like the chicken
- Me too
More of this chicken
And the gravy it's really nice
Gelo: Is it weird when you taste it with the gravy? How does it taste like?
For me, it's really nice with the gravy
I didn't try nothing like this with a gravy, honestly
I like it
Again, total is 5 for me
- 5
The same. 5, 5, 5
I thought Jellybee, Jollibee
Not Jellybee, Jellybees are jelly beans
Oh my god, what is that again?
Gelo: Okay, so the next food is again from Jollibee. Don't worry, this will be the last one from Jollibee
Gelo: It will be the Yum Burger and their Jolly Spaghetti
Like real spaghetti?
Gelo: Yeah, like real spaghetti
- And, how did you say? Yummy burger?
Gelo: It's called Yum Burger. It's one of their signature burger
Gelo: In Jollibee
Oh, okay. Let's do that
Ah, this is cute. It's like a McDonald
I love it
Yobi: Most of the kids love it
Kids, right?
Yobi: Yes
Okay, cheers
Cheers
Okay
- Looks good
This is yum
It's so nice
Mayo
Everything I love
This is good
Is this chicken or beef?
I think it's beef
Okay
Yobi: It's beef
It's beef, right?
It tastes like both actually
Look at this
I told you it's mayo
Go shawty, it's your birthday
It's someone's birthday today
Yeah
Happy birthday
We look like we're fighting over this spaghetti
Okay
It's going to look so messy. Oh my god, I'm sorry guys
These are so good
I love them
Really good
Gelo: So how's this spaghetti different from the regular ones?
It's sweet
Oh right, there is some sweetness
Gelo: Yeah, because Filipinos always love to make their food sweet
Because you guys are so sweet
It's really nice, I love this. I love both. I would give 5 for this
5 and 5
I'll give 5 to this (Yum Burger). This one (Jolly Spaghetti) 4
I'm not really used to a lot of sweet on like
- Ah, on the food?
Food, yeah
I like that combo. I like when they put -
But it's really good, actually. That's why I gave it a 4 only because I'm not used to having sweet or sugar Yeah
I'm telling you we're going to wash dishes at the end
Gelo: So we gave you some barbecue sticks, and that's how you'll eat it
So one stick for each of us?
Yobi: Yeah
But don't you use sticks like a
- What is this? Why am I worried? I feel like there's a surprise inside
Is this sweet?
Gelo: That's the sauce
Dana, why are you scared?
I don't know, I don't trust Angelo
Oh
What is this?
Oh, it's like meatballs
Gelo: So it's called Squid Balls
Squid Balls?
Ah, so it's not meat
It's squid?
- It's seafood
Ah, you don't like seafood?
No, I told him
She's not a fan of sauces
Dana is like looking at me like
She's like, 'what are you eating?'
How's it?
I feel like it's 3 or 4
I mean, I like it but
- Not your favorite
Not my favorite
I think I would give this 3
I think 3
I do like squid but I feel like it's too much
- For you, okay
Yeah, for me
But it's cool
Dave: Yeah, typically when we eat it in the streets they usually fry it
Gelo: It's deep fried
In front of you?
Dave: Yeah, in front of us. Then, we're the ones who will actually pick it out ourselves
Oh
Gelo: So we get our sticks and then after he fries it, he puts it on a container and then we're the ones who's going to pick it
- Choose the pieces
Gelo: Yeah
Oh, oh oh
These are Lumpias?
Sweet Lumpias?
Gelo: And the next food, it's called Turon
Turon?
Gelo: Turon
Spring Rolls but Sweet Spring Rolls
Yobi: There's a twist, yeah
Gelo: Just try it
I'm going to find shrimps inside the sweets
- No seafood
Of the Turomb
Not Turomb, it's Turon
Turon
Turon
What is this?
Is this chicken?
No Dana, it's sweet how can it be chicken?
I wouldn't know
Banana
Ba-ba-banana-right?
Is it like Filipino banana?
It's the same banana
Filipino, European, whatever
- No
No, you have tiny bananas
Gelo: What?
It's not true
I'm sorry guys
Cut
Gelo: I have a question for you Suzanna: Have you ever tasted Filipino banana?
Why do you know it's small?
Cut
I really loved it, but for me, without the topping
She likes bananas
I love it but without the topping
- Me too
I feel like the taste of the syrup on top it's kind of strong
Yobi: It's brown sugar, actually
Ahh
- But for me, because it's crunchy and it's sweet already, I don't want to put any extra topping
So, I would actually rate it 5 without the topping. But with this sauce or sugar, I'm going to make it 4
For me, I don't like the topping but I like everything else. So, let's vote 4
Dave: To be honest, that's not a topping. Turon is actually fried in brown sugar
Dave: It was deep-fried in sugar
Yobi: And it's not the typical banana, that's called the Saba (sweet plantain)
Yobi: It's like a local banana in the Philippines
Gelo: Next food
- Bread?
Gelo: It's called Puto
Are you swearing at me, man?
Shame on you. Guys, don't listen to him
Is this a muffin?
It's a mini muffin
Gelo: I'm not joking. It's called Puto
Is this ginger?
- Stop saying that
This is nice
This is really nice
I like this
For us Arabs, like if you give it to my aunt, she will give me a cup of tea with it and she will actually eat it
With this?
- Yeah
Like a dessert?
- No, I feel like having a cup of tea with it. It's something that we do
But this was so nice, actually
It's light, it's not heavy
It's really nice
- It's like a combination between muffin and bread
And there is sweet and cheese, right?
Sweet and salty
- It's not too sweet, it's not too, yeah
Gelo: So how would you rate the food?
5, this one, 5. I rate this 5, actually
I said 10, but it's okay. It's 5
Yeah, 5 for me too
I think this is like really close to the bread that we ate in the beginning
- Yeah
This was a really nice surprise
I like it
- Yeah
What's this, Falafel? Angelo?
Yeah, Falafel. Filipino falafel
I like the name
What's the name?
This is a very cute name. Silvanas
Silvanas. It's like Spanish
Gelo: Yeah, it's like Spanish
It's not Puto
Silvanas. I like the name already, so
Dave: So we have three different kinds
I'm going to have the cookies and cream
- No, you don't. You're going to have matcha
You're wearing pink/purple
- And you're wearing green so
Okay, we can share. We can share
I'll try to break it
- Okay, break it. Let's try it together
Angelo
Okay, we got it
This looks nice
Surprise
This looks like it has ice cream inside
That we can talk about
This is really good
Dance. 3, 2, 1
This is so good, right?
- This is really good
It's like a biscuit, with some like
What is it? It feels like it's ice cream
Cream
It's delicious
This one is delicious
This one
It's actually not bad
What is the difference?
I don't know. But this one feels like there's pistachio
- Pistachio, right?
It has pistachio?
So good
This is really good
Delicious
Delicious
So my favorite is cookies and cream, then the pistachio, then this is my least favorite
Yeah. For me, first the pistachio because cookies and cream is like, I already tried so many things cookies and cream
- But it's different
It is, it is definitely
- Totally different
I would give pistachio and cookies and cream 5. And this, I would give it overall 5
Overall, 5
5. and I love it. I feel like it's so refreshing when you eat it, right?
I can even add some ice cream on top
- Yeah
I wouldn't mind. It would actually taste so good
Silvanas is delicious
Gelo: So the last one is a dessert
Gelo: It's called Halo Halo
Okay, ohh
This is haram?
Gelo: No, Halo Halo
Halo Halo
Yobi: Halo Halo mean mixed
Hala hala
Halo Halo means mixed?
All: Yeah
So we should eat like
- And do you know what's Hala Hala?
Like Welcome. Hala
Ahh
This one's Halo Halo, hala hala come to me
Dana's teaching Arabic today
Yes, I learned a few Filipino words
Dave: The reason why you call it Halo Halo is because, before you eat it, you need to mix it first
Yobi: We mix it like this
I'm giving you the honor to do that
- Me?
I will make a mess
It's like milkshake with juice, fruits and some ice
It is Halo Halo
What is that green stuff?
Yobi: That's gulaman
Gulaman
Yobi: Yeah, it's like a jelly
Okay
I couldn't do more. Is this okay
- You did your touch here
Let me dig in, I want some mango or something
I love this
Brain freeze
Oh my god, this is good
- This is so good
It's really nice and refreshing. I would have it while I'm in the beach
- Summer
But only in the beach, and that's it
But it's summer
Because it's again too sweet for me. I'm not going to lie
This is not sweet at all
- No, for me it's too sweet. Maybe the mango is what was sweet when I had some
But it's so refreshing, actually
Like, I can imagine that I'm sitting in the beach and I'm having it
I can have it every day
I wouldn't mind to have the burger every day, and the bread
And what was that again? The small muffin
You guys, this is so good
All: Ahh, Puto
I don't like the name, let's change it
I would rate this 4
Hey, stop it
Today, she's losing control. What's going on?
- Cheat day
Cheat day, guys. Bring the food back, bring it. I want to see Suzanna eating the burger, everything
I love this. I love it
I love seeing Suzanna like this, by the way
I swear, this is so good
Gelo: And usually we serve this during the summer in the Philippines
So, this is the time?
It's so good. It's so refreshing and I don't feel like this is too sweet. I feel like there's much more ice than anything else
Maybe the piece, the part I took
- Yeah
It feels like it's, you know like a candy when you were a child eating those like jelly beans or gummy bears
And with ice. Like the perfect combo
Yobi: And sometimes they put ice cream on it
What?
Dave: Ice cream on top
Next time we're going to have Shawarma together
You guys, this is so good
Enough is enough, Suzanna
You're going to regret this
Gelo: So now, out of all of the food that you've tasted, which one would you recommend
- To my audience?
Yeah, to your audience
To my followers
First of all, the bread is amazing.
I really want to go now and buy two bags because Adnan, my baby, he loves bread
Every day in the morning, with cheese. I usually make it with cooked cheese or something for him.
It's really good. I would actually have it every day, I don't mind
So that's your favorite?
Gelo: It's called Pandesal
And of course the burger
I think we Arabs love burger more than anything and coffee
But the burger was really really good
I know your point which is it's a bit like McDonald's burger but it's not the same
No no no, it's not
The mayo is different, the beef is different
It tastes something between beef and chicken, but it's beef. That's why it's very unique
And the swear word, Puto
Swearing word, Puto
Mini muffin, or I don't know what it's called but it's really light and yummy for me
So, those are your favorite
So, number 1 is bread
- The bread. Because I can have it like as a snack with coffee
Oh yeah, that's true. And it's hot
I would say my favorite, what is the name?
Gelo: Halo Halo
Halo halo
It was my favorite, bread definitely, and that Puto
Also Puto?
So, ice cream, not the ice cream
- We actually forgot about something that we actually like
Gelo: Silvanas
Silvanas
What is - oh, Silvanas
So we loved all bread and all sweets
It's really tasty, Filipino food. It's really tasty
So I really like everything, I would actually recommend
- Not only the, only the squid we didn't like
I didn't try it because I don't eat seafood
That's why I'm like (doubtful)
Thank you guys for inviting us
- Thank you so much. I can't wait to watch the episode
Watch the episode guys
And eat Filipino food, okay?
Call Angelo
Halo Halo
Bye!
