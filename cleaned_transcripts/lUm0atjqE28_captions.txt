Hello and welcome to the Vivre aux PHILIPPINES channel
Today, a short tour of the city of
Dumaguete
We are on the boulevard in the city center
Rizal Boulevard
Usually it is very crowded
People go for a walk with the family, take a stroll with the doggie
It is Sunday afternoon and there are really not many people
Thank you COVID
There, we are on the northern part of the boulevard
The boulevard is separated into two parts
The main part in the city center over a length of 800 meters to the port
And the northern part we are on
currently
Bohol Sea, Philippine Sea
On the far left you can see the south of
Cebu Island
A panoramic view with the South of Cebu Island
To the south, the town of Oslob where you can see the whale sharks
The biggest fish in the world
There, we start to see Siquijor
There you go, the island of Siquijor
At the bottom, we have the island of Apo
Barely visible
The Sunday meeting for bikers
Head to one of Dumaguete's markets
Daro market
Here we are on Rue Blanco
The advantage of 2 wheels, once again
Youppie, it's parked, it's done
Music like everywhere in the Philippines, even in the markets
There are not many vendors and there are
there is not a lot of product either
It's not the best day
The police
We arrive on the national road South of
Negros
With fairly sustained traffic
Dumaguete is a city of 120,000 inhabitants
and there is no traffic light
Just fit into the traffic at
good time
Here we are on Rue Blanco
Little stop at the neighborhood mini-market
Of course, the mask, the disinfectant
Here we are on San Jose Street
Return to Rue Blanco
