professional singer and a vocal coach and

special day because i want to give my a wholehearted
congratulations to philippines because as
a few days ago philippines officially have
their first disney song which is sang by one
and only and my absolute favorite casey tending
goodbye by casey tendingin is a filipino version
of lead the way which is an official song
to disney movie aria and the last dragon i
am just so incredibly proud first of all i'm
very proud that she got to sing it in her
mother tongue in tagalog and at the same time
i'm really just overall proud of her because
she is now really acclaimed international
artist she always have been one of my most
favorite singers so i am jews all over the
moon from my girl if you are interested in

first ever disney song in filipino for the
movie raya and the last dragon
oh this is so cute look at her she's so
[Music]
happy [Music]
oh her voice is so stunning in that song like
casey has this beautiful tone quality that
is just so unique it's so incredibly unique
also i just want to go and hug her i just
want to go and hug her oh my god i'm so excited
for her
[Music]
foreign
[Music] orange is very very fast uh her voice
is absolutely stunning within that song she
has not only a very typical tone quality a
very unique tone quality but at the same time
her singing style is very unique as well never
push too much into her belts she never goes
really overboard she focused on the beautiful
development of the tone and you could hear
it on the very last one how she started it
and then beautifully opened it and then like
finished it with a very slow heavy vibrato
[Music] oh god beautiful absolutely stunning
yeah also at the tagalog or in the filipino
language within the song it's absolutely different
the phrasing is so much different than english
language and uh it's just it has that spirit
way way imagine if it would be sang in english
language if i would go to cinema to see this
movie i would love to have this version english
is not my native language and filipino language
is not my native language but i would love
to see this i would love to hear this because
that's the spirit of that movie is in that
song it's in that language it's in dead culture
such a beautiful tone there too [Music] very
open still very very strong and then she switched
into a very thin head voice beautiful
absolutely 10 out of 10 for the writers of
the song i really have to say because all
the high beautiful open tones are on an open
vowel most of them are ah which is just absolutely
fantastic for the singer there's like a dream
vowel to have at a very high belting tone
it's a dream wow you can completely drop your
jaw have everything relaxed and just open
the tone let it shine and in her fashion she
likes to open it let it shine and then add
a little bit of heaviness till the like end
of the phrase and just make it a little bit
more heavy just creates a little bit more
texture there [Music] oh 
then red one's beautiful it was on e so it
resonates a little bit more in the front it's
well fixable
very very very very cute i love that [Music]
point
i'm so happy for her oh my god [Music] again
that up beautiful open tones are on such a
well done vowel very well written song i know
there's a version in korean i know that uh
there is also like english version of the
song and i'm not sure what a vowel is put
there and who re texted and made the lyrics
for the tagalog version but whoever retexted
it and made the new lyrics are like the filipino
version of the lyrics very well done very
very very well done [Music]
the whole song for me just has exactly that
vibe that i was kind of expecting from uh
her casey so she kind of stayed very true
to her style she definitely brought her essence
into uh this song at the same time it's it's
really uh very obvious that it is a disney
song like you can tell the disney vibe is
still there as well it's very very very full
of like a life force it's so obvious she put
a lot of passion into that [Music] [Applause]
song
[Music]
[Music] that was a hard phrase because it
was somewhere between oh and [Music] it's
very and difficult to place it to be able
to also at the same time open it
[Music]
the high tones are just so stunning especially
with her voice maybe i'm biased after listening
of the song i cannot i cannot imagine other
singers singing this like they can technically
every singer should be fine nailing this song
but i feel like she was made for this with
that tone quality oh my god
[Music]
oh look at her she's so proud i would be as
well i am proud of her a lot [Music] this
is definitely an insanely big step for her
and for everything she represents proud [Music]
this happy cheerful tiny human being i mean
do i have to really point out that i really
enjoyed the song i really enjoyed her singing
uh looking back at the song i cannot really
imagine anyone else taking over that role
i think she was really built for it and she
was really ready for it i saw she's been making
moves you know and i was very proud of her
back then but i never even imagined that she's
gonna go and do such a fantastic amazing thing
so i'm very glad that they let a filipino
artist represent their own culture i'm very
proud of that and i'm very proud of her and
i'm uh congratulating everybody i am very
happy that your culture is gonna get showcased
uh i will be making uh more reactions to casey
very soon because i got them planned and then
disappeared so if you enjoyed the video don't
forget to subscribe right here and here is
the video that youtube actually recommended
for you and here is the rest of my filipino
reactions please stay safe and healthy i'm
gonna see you next time thank you bye
