i just wanted to make a quick video about the 
condo that i was staying in here in manila  
and wanted to show you what 400 a month currently 
can get you in manila so we'll start here from the  
hallway so basically opens up uh one bedroom 
apartment we got the bathroom right here
has washer little washer shower a little 
heater uh that washer was pretty good too  
i didn't did the trick couldn't put too much 
stuff in there but it's so nice having a washer  
actually in your unit uh here's a little tooth 
top burner i didn't cook anything but there was  
an option for that comes a little microwave 
mini fridge little desk tv that tv tv didn't  
work they didn't tell me that before i moved 
in but whatever wi-fi little couch got a mirror  
there was a table right here too but it was 
covered in mold so i took that out they have like  
a little armoire right here for the little clothes 
good size you know it's all you need if you're  
traveling um got the bed it's like a full-size bed 
which is like just smaller than a queen-size bed  
a little ironing board uh here's the patio and 
that's the table i was talking about i just  
put it outside because it was covered uh it was 
pretty moldy so i figured that was pretty nasty  
so i took it out uh 25th floor 
so this is pretty high up  
it's got the aircon the thing was always dripping 
on me at night when i was sleeping uh so yeah  
that's i mean that's pretty much it so this place 
i actually found it on airbnb um but then we we  
did a side deal on the side with the woman i 
was talking to on there and i paid 17 000 for  
20 days so basically three weeks seventeen 
thousand three hundred about three hundred  
forty dollars u.s um that included she also made 
me pay extra for she made me pay uh twenty twenty  
one thousand twenty dollars for electricity 
and then like i don't know another thousand  
i think we came to for the wi-fi so total i paid 
seventeen thousand i gave him a fifteen hundred  
peso deposit which i'm supposed to get 
back right now but i'm checking out  
so this was this place was okay 
supposedly you could rent this place it on  
for about 15 to 18 000 if you're actually 
living here like if you're to rent a lease  
so i mean if you're coming to asia and you're 
going to spend any amount of time here do yourself  
a favor and just maybe stay in an airbnb for a 
week or two or a hotel for a week and look around  
seriously especially if you're going to spend 
more than a month or a couple months you'll see  
it'll it'll be a much better experience for you'll 
get a much better deal you get a much better price  
and it's so much cheaper than airbnb because you 
know they have the service charge fee now and  
they have all the taxes that come along with it 
even though airbnb is great especially if you're  
just popping in i still recommend it but if you're 
going to spend any amount of time here more than a  
month i would say it's definitely worth going 
getting on facebook they have facebook groups  
um if you know anybody here ask them if they 
can put you in contact with anybody because i  
mean look at this this is all just residential 
i mean there's no shortage of apartments here  
in manila so my experience still here here was 
pretty good the building's nice it has security  
down there and it has a mall at the bottom of it 
with some restaurants so that was convenient has a  
supermarket down there and it's pretty essentially 
located it's here in makati pretty close to um  
pretty close to everything really around here so 
i had a good time here um i definitely would have  
if i known the late so honestly when the lady was 
bringing me up here she told me that like oh yes  
sir you know we did like renovations the last 
six months it's been empty and blah blah i was  
like okay and i got in here and just i don't know 
what she was talking about so you know she said  
she like cleaned it really good it wasn't clean it 
smells moldy in here you know it's so just little  
things like that you know it's just irritating 
just because she lied to me about it but  
if you can just check it check the apartment 
if i would have checked this apartment before  
honestly i probably wouldn't have stayed here 
um because this just with the mold smell and  
just i just would have gone somewhere else i 
can just so many apartments always check it if  
you can if you have extra time it's way worth 
it seriously i can't say it enough go and check  
out multiple spots as many as many as you can 
you'll get a good deal and you can negotiate  
you can negotiate and you'll get yourself a 
good deal so anyways i hope this this video  
helps you or it's kind of interesting 
for you let me know in the comments if  
that if it helps you or not i'm actually 
heading out today i'm leaving manila on to  
my next destination in the philippines so thank 
you for watching and we'll see you next time
you
