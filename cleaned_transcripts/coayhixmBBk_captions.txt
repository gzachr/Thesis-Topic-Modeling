we are the lockwoods and we're traveling the 
world to experience up close and in person all  
the natural wonders and distinct cultures that our 
kids would otherwise see only in textbooks and TV  
after spending the past few days hanging out with 
our best friends in BGC we're taking a little day  
trip well outside of Manila compliments of our 
new favorite website for Philippines travel and  
experiences we've left this little day Adventure 
completely in their capable hands so the four of  
us are really excited to see what they have in 
store for us over the next 11 hours let's get to  
it as much as they love BGC Manila we are getting 
out of town and driving a bit to do a day trip and  
we booked this through guide to the Philippines 
it was super easy they have so many options in  
the Philippines so we're gonna actually be looking 
for other tours to do with them in the future it's  
about a hundred kilometer Drive which should take 
us about two hours to get to the k-zone province  
so we've got our very comfortable van here our 
driver is tang and our guy on the way down here  
is RJ it's about 100 kilometers to get down to 
Villa escudero and that's where we're going to  
be spending the day so it's probably about a 
two hour drive south to get there on the way  
back it might be significantly longer because 
it's going to be a Saturday afternoon and with  
traffic it can be a little bit iffy we booked 
this little Adventure through the guide to the  
Philippines website and they've got complete 
trips and vacations on there where you can book  
individually for hotels for flights for rental 
cars and for experiences and what we're doing  
today is one of those stand-alone experiences 
completely planned and booked by these folks and  
you can actually get the exact same Adventure if 
you went to their website and booked it yourself  
completely planned and booked by their amazing 
team the communication is phenomenal by the way  
you can book it yourself at followabc.com/gttp 
full disclosure we will probably earn a small  
commission if you book through our link but of 
course we would appreciate that if you would use  
it everything about booking this was really 
easy we just went to their website they have  
tons of options more than I see seen from any 
other resource in the Philippines and we picked  
some that looked really interesting to us and 
then we landed on this tour because of the date  
lining up but their availability and it was last 
minute too so you know you can book ahead and you  
can also see what's available last minute as well 
but once we decided which tour we wanted to do we  
went ahead and booked it and the communication was 
instant we got an email right away from guy to the  
Philippines we also got an email from great sites 
travel and tours we got the contact for our driver  
the contact to our tour guide RJ everybody was 
communicating really clearly so we knew exactly  
what to expect and they were right on time when 
we came downstairs for the tour this morning
[Music]
we passed so many cows on the way in and they 
all have their buddies their Birds because the  
cows attract so many bugs and the birds just 
sit and hang out with them and eat all the  
bugs so they're best buddies it's just like 
us and the Ocampos symbiotic I was gonna say  
that because we complement each other and we 
help each other and we're gonna live together
yeah not in the same house there's a welcome 
drink oh thank you we have a welcome drink and  
this is they say it's Jello it's not quite as 
thick as the typical Jello we see at home it's  
more liquidy there's Jello in it instead of ice 
yeah it's so done it looks like ice cubes in there  
but those are little chunks of jello oh my gosh 
this is my favorite dessert taste this is what  
I think about when I think of like Foods in the 
Philippines or desserts in the Philippines hello
we're getting the VIP welcome here because we've 
got Rosalie escudero and we have her grandson yes  
right Adam yes did I say it right yes that's 
correct Aaron so it's a pretty easy one to  
remember thank you for this uh fantastic welcome 
we can't wait to see all of the grounds here 85  
hectares or 2 000 Acres of Farmland here I hope 
you have a good stay with us and experience yes I  
hope you guys enjoy and learn from the history and 
culture yeah excellent we can't wait to experience  
the culture here so we're gonna we're gonna get 
started we have a lot of ground to cover today  
enjoy thank you so much they have a lot of water 
buffalo Caribou here on their property and we're  
gonna meet one right now actually we're gonna 
put one to work for us right now this is the  
first Erin's carrying the big backpack today 
yeah but it's misleading it's like just a few  
clothing items and a few light towels it's very 
light not heavy at all otherwise Phil would never  
let me carry it he's too much of a gentleman it's 
not like I have the day off or anything I have  
a different backpack and this link so I still 
have my 45 pounds of gear that I'm carrying around
sign is lagaya which is which is name of the water  
buffalo which means happy lagaya Colt 
I'm I'm lagaya are you lagaya [Music]
[Music]  
we're gonna get off here we have live 
entertainment yeah that's awesome so  
we're heading down to the waterfall for the 
lunch experience and you can just take the  
stairs down over there but we're taking the 
more scenic route switch back ramp here in  
the background because I don't know it's 
just more adventurous [Music] so cool this  
is probably the coolest restaurant we've 
ever eaten at and the wettest it's so cool  
everything like our table and the buffet 
is actually in the Water The Leftovers of  
the waterfall all right you guys ready to take 
our table and this way I'll probably come back
all right away thank you buddy what else do they  
have I'm good on board oh but 
that fish up there noodle yeah
the flip-flops make it a little bit tricky to 
walk on the water because of the algae that's  
growing on the Rock so my recommendation would 
probably be to go barefoot my favorite that's  
mango and I have to get some rice I know I'm gonna 
get in trouble by you Filipinos if I don't get a  
ton of rice with my food too the idea is that a 
lot of Filipino food is really salty and so if  
you use rice with it it evens out and balances 
out the flavor pumpkin and green beans yum the  
pumpkin's great for us Americans because our next 
holiday coming up is Halloween but here in the  
Philippines we're already celebrating Christmas 
and then this is beef no this is this is enough  
this is all I need can you think of a cooler 
way to get to your table a cooler way to put  
the food on your plate and a cooler background 
you know what the food here is really good I  
love that they have something for everybody the 
meat dishes the chicken again with the fish and  
the vegetarian with the pumpkin he's just like 
tapioca grills except smaller and a little less  
flavored starving for jicama a lot of people 
don't like jicama you know they could cross  
between a potato and an apple it's a little 
bit sweet tastes very starchy to me this is  
one of my favorite things in the world I would 
prefer to snack on this than almost any other  
fruit or vegetable and I love making salads 
with it I wonder if technically we should not  
be using utensils we're supposed to be having a 
meal with mom duty this weekend where you don't  
have utensils traditional Philippine I'm uh I'm 
doing a mix really good chicken watermelon you  
guys want more watermelon probably thinking this 
is my kind of cocktail because it's huge I don't  
think there's very much booze in it it's a good 
temperature a lot of times these are really hot  
when you're out in the hot environment but this 
one's really cool but yeah I throw a little bit  
of rum in there maybe some fresh lime a little 
bit of triple sec a lot more rum the coconut is  
considered the tree of life here because they 
use every part of it from the palm branches to  
the the room it's the the Coconuts the Shelf 
if you saw our episode at the fantasy Lodge  
in South Cebu you saw that there they used 
the coconut shells that were left over to  
burn the fire under the Kawa baths we have and 
that really is what all of the acreage here is  
used for it is basically a coconut farm and yeah 
you can also use it to make dishes and obviously  
lots of lotions and other skin care products it's 
not exactly a natural waterfall in case you were  
wondering this is a hydroelectric Dam so they 
can generate electricity from the water coming  
through here and hitting the turbines and I'm just 
making stuff up now no I mean it's all true damn
sun's out guns out Colts ready to party and 
we can't leave this waterfall without getting  
lots of pictures and footage and if you want to 
follow us and see what we're doing in real time  
make sure to follow us on Instagram we post a 
stories daily of what we're doing in the moment  
okay super unique way to eat lunch and to fall 
down it's the closest I've come to falling down  
without having cocktails for lunch oh good one 
I I thought I had a joke about the fall it's a  
crazy little Beetle up there or crazy big Beetle 
up there I think it's a cockroach what'd you  
get from me she's gonna have a really hard time 
keeping it from me I'm gonna steal her mango um
wait a minute no this alone is worth the drive 
out here if you're staying in Manila you've got  
to take the time to come out here and even just 
to have lunch because that is the coolest most  
entertaining fun lunch experience that we've 
had but that's not all that we're doing this  
place like Phil told you is humongous and we have 
a lot more to do around the property this is just  
the beginning we're gonna take the stairs back up 
just to you know keep things interesting and some  
keep exercising we left early so we didn't get 
to work out this morning this is our StairMaster  
thank you [Music] this is just one of the rooms 
that they have along the lake it's a coffee shop  
but this Lake it looks like a river because it's 
long and narrow and it's actually a volcanic Water  
by volcanic water basically saying this water is 
spring water that runs down the mountains over  
here which are volcanics uh extinct volcanoes 
beautiful this is so tropical here it feels  
like we're in a rain forest but there's so much 
Recreation so many different places you can sit  
and eat so many different places you can play on 
for the kids they are dying to play in that pool  
over there so we're gonna make it around there 
eventually but there's something that Phil and I  
really want to do first it's definitely unlike any 
other Farm I've ever been on hello they even have  
Cottages so you can stay here overnight check this 
out you've got basically this huge indoor outdoor  
area gosh this reminds me of some other places 
that we've stayed so your own private balcony  
table for four right here and then the bedroom 
in there with the mosquito net which of course  
is going to be comfortable when you're right next 
to a river like this I mean you could just hang  
out right here on the river ceiling fans go in and 
I don't know read a book write a book and work for  
a for a family like us we're gonna have to come 
back and stay here because these stairs go up to  
another room this would definitely be where the 
kiddos stay because it's just the Loft area oh no  
I'm wrong this is the Loft area so they Overlook 
the master no privacy for Mommy and Daddy not  
ridiculous they stay in that other room so imagine 
you can come here you can book through guide to  
the Philippines website to do a day trip or a 
vacation package they have a lot of options for  
full vacations that would include your hotel your 
transportation your flights and flights are trying  
to transfer plates are Transportation aren't they 
they include that twice I guess I could definitely  
see us owning or operating a place like this in 
the Philippines we were just talking to Mom Duty  
the other day about having like a boutique Resort 
owning that and running it because I think it  
would be something that's very on brand because 
it's about travel we could host and and show  
people the way we like to travel and of course 
being in business with mom duty deal Campos would  
be pretty killer if you think we should start 
a boutique Resort or a boutique hotel with Neo  
compost over at Mom Duty Channel please leave a 
comment below let us know and it would be family  
friendly that could be our tagline family friendly 
from our friendly family family friendly from our  
friendly family of course that's the worst tagline 
ever I can't even say well right as we're walking  
into this room this is another multi-function room 
that they use for weddings so you could have your  
wedding here oh my gosh this is a gorgeous spot 
to do a wedding and this is where the bride would  
walk down the aisle in the room and the groom 
to the altar I'm gonna pretend to be the bride
[Applause] this where I am right here is the 
Dance Floor I'm gonna try and dance like Melvin  
am I doing it now then let's go babe I'm doing 
it it feels right it's really the same amenities  
that you have in any kind of a really cool hotel 
I mean you can stay here you can play here you can  
get married here this is the conference Hall 
so they have multiple conference rooms where  
you can do all sorts of things generation 
this means Rosario [Music] so natural here
men if you're staying here
all right they're gonna run off and play 
in the pool in the kids area so they have  
a separate adult area and kids pool area 
and the big main one in the middle looks  
like a little bit of everybody they also have 
jacuzzis jacuzzi jacuzzi it seems that should  
already be plural jacuzzi like one I think 
is maybe a jacuzza jakuzu and then jacuzzi is  
anyway I think they have more than one but that 
doesn't sound very refreshing right now [Music]  
it's seriously a better pool than most Resorts 
we've stayed at kind of makes me wish we were  
doing an overnight stay instead of 
just a day trip out here honestly
foreign [Music]
enough fun and games now we're gonna do 
something that I think might be Aaron's  
and my favorite part of the entire 
day which is the cultural component  
so they've got this huge performing 
arts center right here and they're  
gonna do a cool local authentic Filipino 
cultural performance let's head inside
but first we have to get some refreshments
what's up
most of the dances are about the origins of 
the Philippines and how the tribes came to  
be and developed the Philippines used to be a 
series of Kingdoms of tribes and the the gods  
and goddesses that they worshiped the kids 
thought it was particularly silly that one  
of the dances you could see a lot of um a lot 
of the dancers butt cheeks we're always talking  
about the distinct cultures of the world as we 
travel around but it's also very interesting to  
see so many of the commonalities like the very 
first part of that show you could have plopped  
me down in the middle of North Dakota in the 
U.S and said that that was a Native American  
dance and I totally would have believed it there 
are so many similarities and when you think about  
languages that we encounter everywhere we go 
uh Mexico just below the United States where  
you hear a lot of Spanish travel Halfway Around 
the World to Italy and it's so similar and then  
over here and it's still so similar because 
of all of the mutual Origins and influences  
that you get even in this show they were talking 
about some of the Chinese influences for some of  
the the Garb that they were wearing it's just it's 
neat to see how interconnected all of our cultures  
really are even with all of their differences 
we came in on a buffalo and we're going out and  
uh what is this golf cart we went out in the 
golf cart cool what'd you think of the show
like that bird one I really like that one 
I think it was the the sun was the god that  
they were worshiping and it's power this is my 
interpretation of it about how it's it could give  
you strength or take your power away the bird 
one was my favorite because like that that's  
literally me at 3am that's the ancestral home 
of the family bright pink just like the mission  
which is also a museum there are so many cats 
in the Philippines and everybody kind of takes  
care of them they're almost all wild and they're 
very friendly I'd never known that cats could be  
so friendly and uh cuddly actually every cat wants 
you to pet them this building is a private Museum  
it's like the privately owned artifacts from 
the family and we can't film in there so we're  
not going to show you any footage of what's 
inside but it's mostly flora and fauna from  
the area here and also a lot of artifacts from 
the family their history and all their travels  
they were Travelers like us count your garden 
by flowers never buy the leaves that fall  
count your jewelries by Golden hours never when 
life's worries call count your nights by stars  
not Shadows count your days by Smiles not tears 
that's gonna be hard for me and on every birthday  
mornings count your age by friends not years 
that's beautiful I love it this is a fantastic  
day tour great way to get out of Manila and spend 
the day it can also be booked as a package through
