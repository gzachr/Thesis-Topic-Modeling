Samuel finally makes his debut, basically?
Yeah right?
Samuel's been through a lot, I mean
he went from 1PUNCH then he gone out--he
was supposed to be part of Seventeen
he left with his personal issues
uhh, Produce 101 I heard he got eliminated
and created a big uproar on Twitter
I remember--I don't really follow up with
Samuel a lot.
He's actually-- he's actually sixteen
I know he's, uhh, he's
half Mexican half Korean?
If I'm wrong, please correct me in the
comments down below
He's sixteen.
I don't know how I could relate to this..
since I'm getting older and everybody 
that's debuting is younger -laughs-
