i'm gonna try four different flavors of 
filipino ice cream the first flavor is calamansi  
i have a little bit high expectations of this one 
because i love citrus fruit like lemon calamansi  
orange mandarin you know those are really nice 
and i'll try this one with a chocolate cookie okay  
so this one is actually a sorbettes sorbet
wow the taste is really fresh 
really fresh and sour maasim right  
this would be really good in the summer 
you know and i'm trying with a chocolate
cookie it's really nice stay till the end of this 
video because each ice cream will get a score okay  
the second flavor that we will try is lychee is 
so nice there we go lychee ice cream and this  
one i'm gonna try with whipped cream okay 
wow this one is really delicious i like it  
the flavor is really like a real 
light you know i'm set up very nice  
and i think the combination with the whipped 
cream made it even nicer excited for the third  
flavor which is melon to be honest melon is not 
my favorite fruit but i know in ice creams or  
lemonade for example it can taste pretty good 
so this ice cream i'm gonna just eat by itself
yummy it's very creamy  
wow i like this taste very creamy rich flavor like 
with the lychee it really tastes like real fruit
now before trying the fourth flavor the most 
delicious so far i find lychee okay and number two  
i like the melon the most okay so now 
we're gonna try a real filipino flavor ube
you know to make this a really filipino experience
i'm just gonna eat this one with bread excited for 
this one because i never try ice cream on bread  
okay exciting it's a very good 
combination actually ice and bread  
wow it's nice and i love it you know 
ube is really one of my favorites  
this one is not so matami's hindi matamis 
okay so the ones that i like the most in order
