we are back in the Philippines we spent a
month in Palawan earlier this year and now
we are back exploring new islands in this
beautiful country we have just got to a brand
new island it is a little bit rainy at the
moment but we're gonna head to our first spot
I think you're gonna love this place let's
go
so guys we've just been driving and we drove
through the rain it just started hammering
it down and obviously on a bike it is terrible
I am literally soaked as you can probably
tell I'm pretty dry because Joel took the
brunt of the wetness but we're going to a
really cool spot I wonder if you can guess
this island just from this this island is
full of palm trees there you go that's all
I'm going to give you foreign
so this is Palm Tree Road Lookout and as you
can tell there are so many palm trees behind
us like this is insane if you don't know we
are in Siargao and I'm so excited to be there
this has been on my bucket list for ages now
and we're here we're in charigo there is so
much to do here and I'm just so excited to
show you this tropical beautiful Island
buckling up and hitting the road let's go
to the next spot which is going to be more
palm trees because we're on palm tree island
also known as Sharia
[Music] so we've just arrived at Madison River
and this is the famous spot in charigao with
the rope swing but I'm not sure if it's here
anymore I haven't seen it yet you can also
get a little tour to a secret Lagoon and on
one of these boats for 550 pesos right guys
let's go check out the top jump which is about
seven meters probably let's
[Music]
[Music]
swung the cow under [Music] yourself I don't
know whether they're building a dam or something
because the water level is quite low when
you're jumping you can't jump too deep because
it's like a little bit Shadow isn't it it
is a little bit I didn't touch the bottom
but you did yeah you have to put your hands
out and jump in a certain spot but yeah it
is safe it is a little bit safe so we are
now going to go on one of those little boats
that we've seen and they look really low to
the water but we want to check it out because
they're going to take us to a secret Lagoon
let's go
so we're just floating along this River and
it is so peaceful isn't it it's
really reflective as well so you can kind
of see the whole jungle kind of vibe [Music]
so we've just arrived at this little Lagoon
we're going to go there in a bit we're just
waiting in line because there's a bit of a
cue and but there's pigs here and they're
so cute they're like baby piglets and they
are adorable you're stroking a pig yeah he's
so cute they're like puppies
hello hello hello hello
so we've just come into the secret Lagoon
and it's so clear in here it's really blue
considering how green it is everywhere I would
definitely recommend getting the boat here
because it's pretty cheap it's 550 for the
boat and it can fit like maybe three people
on so yeah good deal
so we're now heading back on the boat to where
we left our bike
he's a happy boy this is a cool Island I love
this island so we have just left that spot
and that was awesome honestly 550 pesos it's
about eight pounds definitely would recommend
it it's an awesome spot but the sun is just
setting so we've just come to this spot but
at this spot where we were earlier to check
it out and the lighting looks
but this place it has had a lot of tropical
downpours you only get them for like 10 or
20 minutes of just pure like just loads of
rain and then it kind of ends but as you can
see in the distance there is maybe a little
bit of rain so yeah but then you've always
got a bit of blue and good Sunshine over there
good morning so it's the second day in Charro
and we are going to head out to some cool
spots and we really want to show you this
is our room this is where we're staying we're
not sure how to pronounce it but it's called
sea yog hotel or yeah accommodation it's costing
us like 30 pounds a night but so it is a bit
more expensive but we are in a beautiful place
in sharingale so let's jump on the bike and
let's hand out to this first spot [Music]
so guys we have just arrived at the Rock pools
and it is an honestly a crazy name I'm not
going to try and pronounce it but I'll put
it down below so the entrance fee was 125
for two people and then the parking was 20
on top of that for a scooter and it looks
like we've got this kind of beach and then
over here in the distance you've got like
the jump rocks and The Rock pools which is
where you I don't know where the main event
is one thing to bear in mind if you are coming
here you need to come here at low tide at
high tide you cannot get to the pool so keep
that in mind when traveling share a girl I
think this is one of the nicest beaches in
sharagal that we've seen so far yeah some
of the beaches are quite difficult because
there's so many rocks there's not like super
nice beaches like in Palawan but palawan's
just spoiled with nice peaches isn't it look
how clear the water is it's so beautiful isn't
it oh we should have brought a mask we didn't
bring on Moss we did oh we did we really unpacked
them Absolute hero so you have to walk through
the water to get to the Rock pools and it
is a bit Rocky but it's all right oh it's
getting a little bit deep here I've got a
phone in my pocket so we have just arrived
in the Rock pools and this is beautiful the
water is so clear it's really turquoise as
well get a shot of over there wow so I think
you can jump off these rocks which we're gonna
do obviously in a minute
so you could probably see this guy in the
background I think he's about to jump off
it suddenly gets a lot deeper so you can do
a bit of a jump and of course we're gonna
give it a go aren't we Emilia we are as long
as it's not too hard to climb up those rocks
yeah look there's a rainbow how amazing does
that look although it does mean it's raining
in the distance I can't see rain though so
hopefully we'll be okay yeah the waves wave
is amazing I'm gonna do a little jump because
it looks like it's too hard to jump off those
because you've got to climb like the crazy
rocks
so this is the point at which you climb up
I'm gonna try and do it without the GoPro
in a minute foreign
[Music]
jumping in but I highly recommend shoes because
it is quite difficult climbing up those rocks
if you want to jump in so yeah bring shoes
if you come in here so guess what we've got
coconuts we've got coconuts these were 70
pesos for one and oh it's been a while this
is Island life at its finest they are so good
and the good thing about the Philippines is
they don't use much plastic this is a paper
straw it's just so good knowing that they're
looking off the environment here in the Philippines
it's good make sure when you're having a coconut
you get it cut open so you can eat the middle
because this bit is so good and this one is
super super sweet which is how I like it the
smaller the smaller the coconut the sweeter
it is
[Music] so guys we've finished up here at
the Rock pools we've just been chilling a
little bit at the beach but we're now going
to head to another spot we are heading to
Cloud9 which is one of the most famous spots
in Sharia yeah so let's get on the bike and
let's go so we've just stopped off because
we've seen that there's crocodiles this is
home to Croc the Philippine crocodile which
is actually a critically endangered crocodile
so there you go should we go spotting no thank
you I don't want to go near the crocodiles
yeah maybe we'll come back and have a look
at that another another time so we have just
arrived at Cloud9 to enter now you actually
have to pay a hundred pesos each which is
like a fair amount in the Philippines I think
the money might go towards the boardwalk which
is a rebuilding which actually got destroyed
in typhoon Odette earlier this year or last
year which is a shame so I think they're real
building that yeah so which is kind of fair
enough there are so many palm trees around
here I mean look at them all it's crazy this
island is just full of palm trees we love
them and she's hugging them and so this is
actually a really famous surfboard and the
boardwalk we will show you later maybe towards
Sunset but this is a beautiful spot you can
see in the distance everyone's like surfing
learning to surf this is one of the best surf
slots in the world so yeah if you want to
serve shower girl is your place in the Philippines
[Music] so we just watched a beautiful sunset
and honestly some of the best sunsets I've
ever seen have been in the Philippines look
at the color behind us it looks beautiful
it's such a cool Vibe here at Cloud9 where
you've got the big broad War everyone's like
surfing either side of it it's just such a
cool Vibe everyone's really chilled out and
if you want to do surf lessons you can do
them here which is pretty cool there's lots
of guys asking if you want to do sir so it's
pretty easy to find and here best Sunset spot
I've well so far in shower girl which isn't
long so bear with us but yeah let's go so
we just got back to the hotel from Green waves
Cafe and and I highly recommend the pasta
there it was so good but honestly guys we
are absolutely loving shower gal this is one
of our favorite Islands probably in the Philippines
but maybe also southeast Asia is just amazing
all the palm tree is super tropical the blue
water as you saw earlier it is amazing I'm
so excited to show you more of this island
because tomorrow we're going on a good old
boat trip the classic Filipino boat trips
so that is going to be the next video and
I'm very excited to show you we haven't done
it yet but I just know it's going to be awesome
