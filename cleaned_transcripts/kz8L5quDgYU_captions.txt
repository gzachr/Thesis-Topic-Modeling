cooking the silly gum
uh filipino food that has been really
loud so we're gonna cook it now but
first i have to
take care of myself put my hair in the
bun
so that no hair will get into the food
while i'm cooking
that's how we do it and
then let's get cooking okay
all right i have onion this one
have onion and i have
um bay leaf the sun
and we will use peppercorn
that one and i have sinigang
sinigang sasampalo pinoy
this is the one that we put we filipinos
put this one
if you cannot find this one there's
another also wait
here is another brand also sinigang
that one if you don't have the other
sinjang but this one it says hot
so i'm gonna not use this one because it
says hot
and husband don't like hot food or spicy
foods and
so we're gonna prep i have my
okra from last year frozen okra
this one and i have beans
also i'm gonna put beans
and of course we're gonna put uh some
chilies i'm gonna get the chilies
all right we have the chilis and i'm

um how you call that
do
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Applause]
[Applause]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
pick up this and put here pluck
[Music]
it
[Music]
there's so many
yeah just be careful
be careful myself
there's so many of those little little
red green ones
okay
careful stella your hands is gonna be so
[Music]
[Music]
hot
[Music]
and since this food is um how you call
this one sour
so whatever greens you put in this uh
soup
it will turn brown after
so that's why before putting the
tamarind mix
or this one that makes it sour sachikai
you cannot be seen
this one that makes it sour i have to
put the
green first and blanch it and take it
out and then i will put this one
so that my greens are still green it's
not gonna be brown okay
[Music]
[Applause]
let's put this sinigang
put as sour as you want it to be
so i'll put half of the packet
it's made out of shrimp spices
um
this is what i said that pagman
camina sinigang or this one the leaves
or the greens
will throw brown so ayan po look
it turned brown already it's not green
anymore
but look that the one that i blunt this
one is green so
that's the big difference maybe you will
be afraid like oh my god it turns brown
so it's because of the sourness of the
ingredient or spice that i put in there
that makes it like that the color
dada is here yeah it took me a while
what did you prepare for my lunch
your favorite
you know i don't feel like eating when i
smell it
nice
[Music]
[Music]
we gonna eat so for us
filipinos sinigang is a bayen or a food
already but
for them it's just a soup so
they put it in that this wine and he eat
it first
but for me i put it in sip uh in a
in a separate one and i put rice in
into it so dada will eat it as a soup me
i will eat it as a food with rice
layla what you're gonna eat this one and
this one fortunately leila don't like
sinigang
but stella loves the greens she will eat
her greens also

the meat
