Hi I'm Kris from Philippines 
and welcome to my channel
so for today's reaction video i am reacting to 
japanese invasion of the philippines in 1941
the japanese invasion of the 
philippines was conducted on schedule  
the first landing was made on december 8th 
and during the two weeks following beach  
heads were successfully secured at six points in 
the archipelago the nepanese assault troops have  
been well prepared for this kind of campaign on 
luzon the principal island the strategy called  
for the forces which had landed at several points 
to drive toward manila and seize that objective  
the main strength in that push was 
provided by the assault group which  
invaded the island that lingayen gulf 110 
miles from manila across central busan
by christmas japanese invasions had been 
made at nine points in the philippines  
and the campaign to seize control of this 
important strategic area was well underway  
after a thorough softening up process 
the invaders pressed onward toward manila  
and what they hoped would 
be a quick victory on luzon  
during the first weeks of fighting on lusan 
the japanese steadily reinforced their original  
assault unit as 1941 neared its end the japanese 
were succeeding in closing in on manila from two  
directions the japanese plan for choking off 
the philippine capital was working perfectly
planes began bombing manila in early december
the air attacks continued as the invading ground 
forces grew closer to the philippine capital  
the japanese raids on u.s airfields took 
a heavy toll of u.s planes many destroyed  
on the ground at year's end advanced japanese 
units approached within sight of manila which  
was still bombed though it had been declared 
an open city in little more than three weeks  
the spearhead of the japanese ground offensive on 
the capital had driven within striking distance of  
the objective evacuated by its defenders 
manila was the invaders for the taking  
the philippine capital passed into the hands 
of the enemy on january 2nd 1942. the nebones  
claimed they were liberating the islands but 
most filipinos scarcely considered it liberation  
japanese propaganda units went into action at once 
spreading the doctrine of asia for the asiatics  
are we not all of the far east they asked 
the advantages of life in the greater east  
asia co-prosperity sphere were dimmed into 
the consciousness of filipinos of all ages
filipinos helped the japanese in their campaign in 
manila streets filipino collaborationists spoke to  
their countrymen in tagalog the philippine native 
tongue the conquerors blamed the philippines  
troubles on the us but their campaign was 
not an overwhelming success most filipinos  
remained unconvinced they remembered the story of 
japanese rule in china and manchuria the greater  
east asia propaganda continued throughout 
the occupation but it needed strong backing
in mid-march with the enemy in control of almost 
all of busan general douglas macarthur the  
american commander left the island on orders from 
washington and assumed new duties in australia  
the general arrived on the down under 
continent to take over the preparations  
for mounting an offensive against 
the enemy at the earliest opportunity
in manila the start of the japanese occupation 
was celebrated by the invaders with a parade  
through the center of the city the seizure of 
the philippine capital gave the nipponese more  
satisfaction than most of their other conquests 
most gratified of all was the japanese commander  
general masahiro hamad to whom this day was one 
of the most memorable of his military careers  
general huma would have found it hard to believe 
that this city whose people regularly paid him  
deference on japanese proclaimed holidays 
would four years later be the setting for  
his execution for war crimes but during early 
1942 it was hard for the filipinos to see  
beyond the japanese occupation to visualize their 
country again free from the yoke of the conqueror  
under japanese rule some filipinos openly 
collaborated with the invader in late  
april 1942 corregidor in manila bay was the last 
outpost to resist the japanese invaders of lusan  
for almost a month the japanese bombarded the 
island fortress with every weapon at their command
finally on may 5th 1942 japanese assault units 
crossed the narrow channel separating luson from  
corregidor and stormed the rock's dirty defenses 
after nearly 24 hours fighting on the island cease  
on may 6th that afternoon general jonathan 
wainwright the american commander met with  
general hama on nearby bataan peninsula to 
effect the surrender at first the american  
commander surrendered only those forces on 
corregidor and neighboring islets in manila  
bay but not the american units still fighting 
the japanese elsewhere in the philippines  
later however general wainwright was forced 
to surrender all his philippine units  
and in a tremendous voice he announced his 
action to them over the japanese controlled radio  
the historic statement was 
recorded by the goating conquerors
to fully stop the further useless sacrifice 
of human life on the fortified islands
and today i tendered to lieutenant general 
conrad the commander-in-chief of the imperial  
japanese appointment in the philippines 
the from the surrender of all american  
and 17 honest groups in the philippine islands  
this decision on my part you will realize were 
forced to find me by me entirely beyond my control  
hama the beast of bhattan soon set out 
to visit the scene of the epic battle for  
the island fortress after a difficult 
campaign which had lasted five months  
the invaders had finally succeeded in overpowering 
the remnants of the american luzon force  
the final battle had been one of the most bitterly 
fought defenses in history the victorious japanese  
inspected the area with interest the valiant 
stand made by the us fourth marine regiment  
with a mixture of soldiers sailors and filipinos 
attached will never be forgotten by the japanese  
who participated in the battle for corregidor the 
victors were especially curious about the weapons  
which had caused them so much trouble before 
the assault troops overran the island's defenses  
after the capture of corregidor the japanese 
quickly gained control of all the philippines
in the united states a month later the philippine 
commonwealth government was represented by its  
president in exile manuel cason the first steps 
toward philippine independence so hopefully  
planned seven years earlier in washington 
had received a staggering setback but with  
the support of the united states oh that was cut 
well philippines is the battleground of america  
and japan and some filipinos were pro-japanese 
they're helping japanese campaigning that japanese  
were an ally and japanese took control the whole 
philippines in 1942 that some japanese are helping  
filipinos and if you have seen my reaction videos 
to filipinos reacting to japanese kamikaze not  
all japanese are bad filipinos also have friends 
during that time japanese friends well another  
interesting video about world history thank 
you for watching with me i'll see you very soon
