this is the best thing i've 
ever eaten the philippines is  
a vibe we are going to get totally stuck 
in today i don't even know what to expect
10 out of 10 100. this is the world's 
oldest chinatown dating back to 1594  
when the chinese settlers came to the philippines 
this is the ultimate street food paradise today  
we are going to be tasting all sorts of filipino 
chinese street food and to this day this chinatown  
is still full of hustle and bustle and chaos and 
we can't wait to show you everything let's go
it is so crazy here there is such a hustle and 
bustle like chef said so much traffic but i love  
the influence of the chinese and filipino together 
i just want to get stuck in i just want to see as  
much as i can it's crazy everybody is so friendly 
and waving as soon as we get the camera out  
filipinos just come alive thank you to you 
guys because so many of you recommended that  
we come and visit and try the food in chinatown we 
always appreciate your recommendations so much and  
we just wanted to say a huge thank you because 
we've been overwhelmed with the amount of support  
comments the recommendations that you have given 
us so thank you so much and from what we can tell  
you already the philippines is a vibe if you 
have never come here before i highly recommend  
it we are going to get totally stuck in today i 
don't even know what to expect but i am hungry  
already i'm feeling like i'm in it you're just in 
it everywhere you go here in manila you just get  
sucked in so much energy and yeah let's go i'm 
ready let's go what are we on about let's go  
so this is the street i 
wonder who we're gonna find  
our first stop on the list is a place called dong 
bay dumplings and it's actually one of the most  
recommended spots that you can find here in 
chinatown it's known for its really really  
delicious authentic handmade dumplings and 
we absolutely love dumplings so that's the  
first thing we're gonna try right now this is 
the epitome of a hole in the wall restaurant
literally we always like to find these 
kind of hidden spots because we know  
these little hole in the world 
restaurants always make the best food
yes your best seller okay i just won
so we just ordered literally through the glass 
door but we ordered some pork and chive dumplings  
and she said that was the best seller we 
ordered 14 for 200 pesos that is wow what a deal
wow there we go that was easy so excited for this
look at this this is not normally what we see 
for the soy sauce it's normally like in a little  
container or a little bag but this is actually 
so cool i think you're supposed to like bite it  
bite and go just buy the ghost oh they're piping 
hot oh you can see the steam come off of them
should i just bite it let's just try oh  
it's definitely vinegar is it good it's so 
good that's one way to do it that's one way  
to do it and i'm just pouring it all over 
the dumplings that's what you gotta do right  
okay i'm gonna try my very first dumpling 
here in chinatown let's see how it goes
oh yeah look at this on the inside you 
get like an immediate burst of flavor  
and the chives work so well i also like 
the vinegar i think that's the highlight
best dumpling i've ever had hands down i just had 
to put the whole thing in my mouth it is so good  
so much flavor so soft this 
is a good way to start our day
this was a good one highly recommended it's on  
yuchingu street i hope i said that correctly 
but we'll put the link in the description below  
these are so good if it were up to me i would eat 
them every day and i would eat about 50 of them
look at the traffic here in chinatown wow
that's scary
oh this looks cool cafe mezzanine 
looks like it's upstairs
look at this literally hole in the wall
so we're having some calamansi juice
i don't know what it is but it's really sour we 
just researched that a calamansi is a philippine  
lime or something like that we're really enjoying 
this kind of cute cafe we're on the second story  
and then we're gonna go around 
and tour more of the chinatown
we can see how much people love the taste for 
food the filipino flavors mixed in with a chinese  
fusion it has been absolutely incredible so far 
if somebody can please tell us the name of these  
because they are so cool these tricycles and we 
really want to try them but we don't know what  
the name is yet one thing we have learned 
after being in manila for only a few days  
is there is no time when it's quiet it's always 
busy it's about midday today everybody should  
be at work and there is always traffic always 
always traveling what is it sugar cane i think  
wow so cool so we've just turned on to the 
side ali street and it literally looks like  
food heaven they're fresh vegetables 
fruits oh my goodness i have to go and see
i love how we've just ended up on some side 
alleyway but this entire chinatown is just  
covered with these small tiny streets and there's 
so much history and everywhere there are either  
street food fruit and vegetables or there's 
these hidden restaurants in the world
so now we've got something called lumpier which 
is very common in this part of southeast asia  
and apparently it's normally a snack but they've 
made it into like a burrito it's so big so we paid  
95 pesos for this so it is filled with carrots 
and different vegetables and rice yeah it totally  
looks like a wrap yeah it looks like a giant wrap 
so apparently it's a snack but this is like a  
full meal the outside is almost like a little 
thin pancake it's very very light and flimsy  
soft and fluffy that's how i 
would describe it is a huge  
stuffed spring roll probably one of 
the healthiest burritos i've ever had
i hope we can find this everywhere in 
the philippines because i think this  
is like my new favorite i think i'm full 
already but i don't want to stop eating
we've just had the warmest welcome from 
all the filipino people they've just made  
us feel welcome in their country which 
is so amazing everyone is just saying hi  
greeting us waving so we 
really really appreciate that  
and for all of you that have watched and welcomed 
us to your country we really really appreciate  
that we cannot wait to just explore and see 
the beauty that this country has to offer
how are we gonna crush
oh my this
wow there is so much history here in manila 
it's been awesome today to just kind of walk  
around and soak up parts of filipino history 
and culture this is beautiful this is amazing  
definitely reminds me of like 
colonial spain and it's stunning  
we should try this i've heard about it but 
i heard about it we found it i'm so happy so  
we have come to shanghai fried xiao pao 
and i wanted to try this for so so long
and it looks so good it's only 30 pesos
so we have just got our ciao power only 
30 pesos and we're gonna try it right here  
outside the restaurant in the busy streets 
it is high ping park they've got like big  
pots where they are making hundreds 
and literally the turnovers so quick  
that they are making a whole batch and they 
are just getting sold straight out the door  
wow wow so this is the filipino version of 
like a chinese steamed bun that looks so  
good so we have some pork and some chives inside 
look at this wow look at that filling on the
so good inside taste some of the bun good it's 
sweet very very sweet it is so soft and full of  
flavor i am loving this only 30 pesos so 
that is less than a dollar for one of me  
i couldn't let devon have all 
the fun i needed to try it myself
it's absolutely delicious this is the best thing 
i've ever eaten my whole life 10 out of 10 100  
i could eat like 10 of these so as we said we'll 
put the location to all the places that we visit  
today in the description below thank you for 
recommending because we're having a beast  
we are so full i think we've eaten so much 
today this is the best way to kind of end off  
this awesome street food tour in the next video we 
will finally be leaving manila and we are going to  
the island can you guess where let us know in the 
comments below and we'll see you in the next one
