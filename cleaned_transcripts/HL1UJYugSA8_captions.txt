Okay.
Thank you brother.
Good afternoon, everybody from Cebu.
Here in the Philippines and we are island hopping.
We are actually heading to Bohol, um, which is
another amazing island here in the Philippines.
Apparently we can buy tickets over
here and it's like a two hour, uh,
journey over to the lands of Bohol.
We're gonna be spending a couple
nights there, beautiful beaches.
Uh, they've also got these chocolate
Hills, which are these like thousand.
Of, uh, like natural Hills that are super cool.
Anyways, let's see.
We, this is supercat to Ormoc. Which one do we go?
I'm gonna actually, uh, here, I think, yeah,
I need to go Bohol to, uh, which one, ocean jet?
All right thank you.
Ah, this, oh, this one.
Oh, wow.
One big line.
Such a big line.
Oh, how much, how much extra?
You know connections?

Normal price, 800 normal.
Yeah yeah.
How much?
Yeah, yeah.

Sorry?
Well, how much is the ticket?
1,200.
And that is normal class or business
class or, uh, tourist class.
Tourist class.
Yes.
Let me see how much it is, how much
I'm paying for this express service.
What is the normal ticket?
Like how much are you?
If I, if I wait in the line, how much will it be?
Oh, so you get 200.
Yeah, one person.
So if I, you can get the,

All right.
And it leaves at 1:00 PM?
Wow.
Type your name.
Okay.
You know, time is money everybody.
And if, uh, Luke Damant.
Hello, uh, time is money.
And this actually seems like it's gonna
be a big, big line and, uh, it's hot out
here and I'd rather buy the ticket, know
that I have the ticket and then all right.
Know that I have the ticket
and then I can just, um,
then I can go explore for like 30 minutes.
Hey, good boy.
How are you?
What is this?
A lighter
where, what are you guys?
Oh, you guys are making bombs.
Are they gonna light it?
Oh my God.
This reminds me of times that
I lost my fingers in India.
Be careful.
You might not have all your fingers after this.
Oh,  this is actually giving me PTSD.
Look at these kids.
Oh my God.
Oh, magic.
Magic.
Magic.
People are so friendly here.
Anyway.
Where's our boy going?
So I'm actually, I, I, I believe
that the ferries go every hour.
So from around 5:30, 6:30, 7:30, uh,
like there was the 11:40, one at 1:00 PM,
which is the one that I'm catching.
Uh, and I
saw the online, uh, it was like 500 for regular
class or something and 1000 for business class.
But, uh, like since I arrived, this
line literally has not moved, so I'm not
too, uh, fuss in paying extra buck, let
me know how much it would actually cost.
Uh, if you guys like the local people here.
Uh, but I'm more than happy to pay,
a couple extra dollars to avoid this line and
we can just go chill out at 711, eat some
street food, or maybe even explore the area.
As I was saying, time is money everybody.
And so are dogs down, boy.
Uh, how long will, how long will the ticket take?
It's leaving at 1:00 PM?
Yeah.
Uh, where, which.
This one here?
Oh, so just through the it's
like the ferry terminal.
So you guys have the connections
inside to skip the line?
You know.
The same price because if you do the online
or cause very because you know, online and
then you can go to the express -
Very good.
You're from, uh, Cebu or
Bohol or where are you from?
Huh?

Uh, because I get the
expressway.

Okay.
I don't know why I've been
having my bags on the whole time.
but finally decided to put them
down after speaking to James.
Really cool guy.
Super cool guy.
Uh, we've been waiting like 10 minutes.
That was one of the guys
that talk to me, but, uh, I think the other
guy must be coming, uh, later on as well.
Very good.
Anyways, let's wait shortly and then
we'll see if we get this ticket.
Oh, these are the people
waiting for express as well.
This is, uh, my ticket?
Let me see.
Uh, yeah, Luke Damant seat number 24G

Oh, so what time do I need to be here?
- Now
You go inside.
Oh, I go in now?
Oh, okay.
All right.
Fare,
total 800.
So they're getting 400 commission.
Okay.
And they leave it's it's better
than waiting in the line.
Right.
Do I get, do I get YouTube discount?
Yeah, we do.
We do collaboration.
There you go
1,200.

Boarding.
Okay, perfect.
Yeah, let's do it.
All right, so it's 12:30 PM.
Got my ticket here.
Uh, as I was saying, it actually costs 800
if you were to line up in the whole thing.
Uh, but I really don't think that I
would've gotten there in time because
it obviously departs at like 1:00 PM.
But you have to be boarding, uh, shortly.
Hello?
Hello.
Again, I just want to see in your -
This is my new friend.
So you are, you're not catching the ferry.
You're going, where are you from?
From Cebu?
- Yeah here in Cebu.
So you live in Cebu.
Yeah.
I advise you to go in
Siquijor, nice place.
Where to?
Siquijor island.
- Uhhuh, secret island.
Yeah yeah.
It's off
Cebu? 
It's very close to Bohol.
It's an island.
It's secret
nobody knows?
Oh, now everybody knows about it.
Yeah yeah.
I'm waiting for your video.
Thank you so much.
Thank you for watching the videos.
I really appreciate it.
Where, where do I go for the ticket?
I just give it to him and they, they guide me?
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah okay.
Thank you so much.
Nice day idol.
Thank you.
All right, here we go.
Let's give our ticket.
Hello?
Where do I go through here?
Okay.
Thank you.
Wow.
Look at all the ships they have.
So there's so many like companies that do this.
I think the one specifically
I got ocean jet, right?
Yeah I think ocean jet.
And they have one, uh, every hour or so.
So you can just come here, uh, pay
the extra buck to skip the line
and then you go into the big port.
Look at this.
What is human trafficking?
Human trafficking is the act of
forcefully transporting recruiting
persons for the purpose of exploitation.
Well, I'm glad that we have
that sign to let us know.
Ah, terminal fee 25 pesos.
Maybe we ask this, this person.
Hello, where do I go for?
Terminal fee.
All right. Let's line up 25 pesos just to enter, surely
they could just chuck that on top of the,
the fee of the ticket that's around what?
50 cents or so?
Hello.
Thank you.
I go this way.
All right.
Terminal, officially terminal
official entry receipt, 25 pesos.
I go, this.
Oh, thank you, man.
Guys, I have not caught a boat for a while.
The last time I recall was potentially in coachy
back in 2019, maybe, or like an actual, uh, ferry.
Obviously we caught like the boats in
Iraq, where we went out on the water.
Um, in, in Pakistan, we went on the jet ski
and the little boats in lake Attabad.
Of course.
Yeah yeah.
Where are you guys going to Bohol?
How far away is it?
Oh Leyte.
I know I've heard of Leyte.
You're from Cebu or you're
from, uh, Leyte?
From Leyte, you're alone?
Yeah.
I'm just by myself going to Bohol.
So where are you going?
Bohol.
Yeah, I'm going to, Bohol also July 5 - 7.
Can I have your Facebook?
My what?
Facebook, Facebook or number?
Yeah, I have Facebook.
Yeah Instagram.
Instagram is best.
Can I have your number?
Usually it's the guy that asks
for the number.
No, no, no.
Is it just a friend.
Oh my God.
No there's nothing's like -
there's nothing like a, yeah.
You can message me on Instagram,
because that is where I'm most active.
That is, uh, me there.
Okay.
All right I need to catch this ferry.
I might miss it.
Okay.
What's your name?
Nice to meet you guys.
See you.
All right.
Let's go in.
Hello?
Excuse me.
Not allowed to video.
Okay I stop.
Hi, I go this way.
Just ask -
Thank you so much.
Hello.
Do you know what gate I'm going to for?
Uh,
Gate eight.
I can, I can board now? Gate seven and eight.
All right.
Seven, eight.
All right we're finally, in the terminal, I feel like
this vlog has just been all over the place.
It's so hard traveling, uh, with bags
and stuff, and always trying to like
have the camera in the best positions.
But as I was saying, we finally got our ticket.
We got into the terminal, I spoke to
a fellow over there and he said, uh,
gate number eight, there's so many, uh,
like people there's no seats over here.
So I'm just chilling in this other area.
Uh, but 25 pesos, it was worth the, uh,
the terminal, I guess you don't have like
any other option if you want to board the,
uh, board, the boat, but the terminal.
We've got wifi, it's got food, it's got drinks.
And most importantly, it's got AC and it's super
hot outside, especially when you're sitting
in the sun with all these bags and whatnot.
So, uh, it's around 12:40 PM at the moment.
And, uh, gate number eight is just over that way.
So, uh, I, when I walked over
there, I couldn't see the boat.
I don't think it had arrived.
Obviously it's bring passengers from
Bohol to Cebu and then they all depart.
And then you hop on.
So I imagine 10 or so
minutes, the boat will arrive.
People will get off and then we'll have the opportunity
to board on the ocean jet express.
It's not allowed to video.
Oh, okay.
I'll I'll stop.
Sorry.
Okay.
I'll stop on the, on the, on the ferry I can do.
Okay.
All right, guys, gotta keep the camera low.
I've got a second warning for filming in here.
um, so I'm not gonna film much more.
Uh, we just film once the boat arrives and once.
Am on the, uh, on the ferry.
Uh, so until then, we'll see you there
All right guys look at this boat here.
So this is our ride for the next couple of hours.
They're packing in all the luggage and whatnot.
Look at all that at the back.
Hopefully there's no waves or also peoples.
Okay.
We can board here?
Yes.
All right.
We're first on.
We're first on into the new entrance.
Look at all these bags.
All right, so what seat are we?
Let's see, uh, seat number 24G.
 A B C D E F G.
We're somewhere on the right.
At the front section.
Sorry, smart move.
Let's get across
24.
Here we go.
24 G.
So this is our ride for the next two hours guys.
24.
Let me just double check
that we're in the right seat.
Yeah 24 G.
You can see that there 24 G alright, nice
AC reasonably comfortable seats, little
bit, uh, lack lossed with space here.
Because I got my, my two bags, which are
increasingly getting heavier and heavier as
I travel, which is not how I like to travel.
I always like traveling light, but uh, I don't know,
we're getting too many shoes and we're getting
too many singlets, too many cricket jerseys.
Stuff's starting to, uh, to get
big in the old baggage, but.
I'll give you guys a tour once we're, uh,
once we're moving, maybe we can hang out the
side or go out on the, like the top deck.
We'll see, but, oh, I'm glad it's
AC I'm so much more cool right now.
It's uh, it's good.
So this is our ride for
the next couple hours guys.
All right, guys.
We are on the journey.
Thankfully got us spare seat next to me.
So, uh, that's always a pleasure, uh, a
pleasant surprise when you catch an airplane
or a ferry, the extra space that you need.
Uh, but as I was saying before,
it's like a two hour journey.
Goodbye Mr.
Mr. Port, I'll catch you guys later Cebu on the
next trip, but, uh, yeah, once we get going
for a while, we'll head out the back, meet
some people and uh, we'll hang out side or,
you know, get a little bit of action out here.
It's gonna be a fun journey.
I love, uh, maybe the trips
have a little, or do we chips?
I'll have, what do we have?
How much are they?
35.
Okay, I'll just have this one please.
Cheese chips.
Wait 15 or 35?
Okay.
Um, uh, do I have five pesos I think so.
There you go.
Thank you.
Alright guys, grab some, uh, some
cheese flavored potato chips on the
packet said 15, but I got charged 35.
So it's kind of funny how it's like
literally written there as well.
So don't have less tourists.
Part is Jack and Jill.
So I'm not sure if these are like Filipino,
they are Filipino approved, which is good.
But you guys know how much I love cheese.
So these are,
this smells just like a cheese paratha,
but on the inside, you can see like here,
give you a quick
little they're kind of, uh, like, uh, thinly
cut ones, not like the -
So, uh hmm.
They just smell really good.
So,
They're nice.
They taste kind of just like Doritos
cheese, um, cheese, Supreme Doritos,
the ones that come in the red packet.
So, hmm.
They definitely got the recipe right.
For, uh, these ones, Jack and Jill,
Jack and Jill went up the hill to
fetch a cheese paratha.
Or a cheese bag of chips.
Welcome to Bohol everybody.
And welcome to the rainy
season here in the Philippines.
It is, uh, oh, security and stuff.
What is this for?
I do need a taxi.
Yes, please.
Yes.
I'm going to Madala beach resort.
Our rate going there for one car is 800 pesos sir.
800 pesos.
Yeah.
And it's like it's private.
- 30 minutes.
Yeah it's a private.
- How far away is it?
40, 35 to 45 minutes.
Yes.
I go with
you guys.
Okay.
I was looking at grab and they
don't even operate on this island.
So I go with you?
Uh, yes, sir.
Okay, cool.
But, um, This is like the
first time I'm experiencing.
Hello brother.
I go with you.
All right.
Nice.
Uh, I don't wanna be running out in the rain
trying to get a cheaper price, so I'm happy
to pay 800 it's around $16 and it is like a
40 minute ride to my hotel, um, which I was
gonna film I'm there for like two nights.
Super nice place on the beach with like 200 whoa.
Police almost hit me.
It's like $200 a night, but, uh, I
might wait until the rain subdued.
So maybe tomorrow morning we'll do that video.
But overall guys, the ferry, I
was actually freezing in there.
It got so cold.
Um, but.
I didn't really get up or anything.
I was kind of like sitting down.
I fell asleep, actually.
This one?
Here, here, here.
This one?
Yeah.
All right.
Cool.
Thank you.
It's 800 right?
Yeah.
Yeah.
What's your name?
Jong Jong.
Jong Jong.
Ah Jong Jong Miasco.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Oh, you do the whale sharks.
The fire flies.
Yeah, very good.
Anyways guys.
So quick little rundown on the ferry.
Super cold on there.
Um, because I was obviously in a singlet
that I almost start to pull out a
jumper, but fell asleep on there.
Um, it was raining basically the whole way.
There weren't really any like viewing areas.
I wasn't near the window.
So there wasn't really much,
uh, exciting things to film.
Um, so I kind of just like sat there.
honestly, I will be surprised if
this video makes it on YouTube.
I feel like this is the
worst video I've ever filmed.
Uh, went to bed at like
3:00 AM, 3:00 AM last night.
So energy levels are severely depleted, but
guys Bohol, a wet and old rainy day here.
Bohol.
That kind of is a common theme during
rainy season here in the Philippines.
It's nice during the day and then the
evening showers and the evening rain come by.
Um, but oh, plenty of food there.
I'm a bit hungry, but, um, yeah, if
this video makes it off on YouTube,
thanks watching , um, chase your dreams
and we'll see you guys in the next one.
Goodbye.
