don't know what to expect but we're excited i mean  
we're gay just so you guys know so we have to like

that a small town like liloan would be celebrating  
us the lgbt community it's insane and you could 
just feel the energy this morning also it's 7  
30 in the morning so for the lgbt community to 
be up and doing this this early in the morning  
shows commitment but they're also it's also july

excited for pride yes yes of course how long have 
you guys been doing the pride here in the lawn  
actually we're preparing this one for three 
weeks three weeks yes okay it happens every  
year like normal actually this is the first time 
oh no way the first time yeah wow that's awesome
it's about time then okay good good  
i had to step away from all the excitement and 
just talk about how happy it makes to both of us  
to see the turnout here at lilon it's our first 
prize here in the philippines as well side and  
it looks like it's about to start so let's go 
ahead and get started and see what's all about
oh
what's your name my name is jin 
all the way from philippines  
we find ourselves walking in the parade now 
and this is awesome yeah it's their first  
year having it here we were just cold and 
it's not like a huge mega but guys it's it's  
it's perfect it's the right size it's representing 
people it doesn't matter how big it doesn't matter  
people seem to be very responsive along 
the streets which is nice honking et  
cetera et cetera so we're all about it and 
apparently this is a two mile parade so
but you know what we're up for it 
we're all about the pride loving life
something about how it is
shade because you know how it is here we just 
gotta get some uh some relief so two miles we're  
gonna be trekking along so uh yeah it's fun we're 
it's good to see people prideful and proud hey  
my gay little heart to know and see how prideful 
the community of lilon is for the lgbt community  
there are a lot of allies here a lot of people in 
the community just parading down the street and  
you can just tell that the locals 
are very supportive as they stand  
on the side of the road just cheering on and 
watching us go as we sweat our way like it's hot
we got our workout in this morning and it was 
awesome guys it was again it might not be the  
biggest of the greatest to other people but it 
matters and it was fun and it's beautiful and  
again at the end of the day it doesn't matter if 
there's two people three people or five thousand  
people like having recognition and support of 
who you are and just seeing somebody else like  
you or an ally it's important and if it is and i 
wouldn't change a thing about it makes us happy  
it truly truly makes us happy to see how how a 
community this small compared to a bigger city  
still shows the love and support for our community 
and power to everyone who put the time and energy  
into their floats like their clothes are awesome 
and they're resourceful and they still look good  
as heck like it just proves like you should be 
creative and anything's possible so we made it  
to the sports complex where they're going to 
open up with the ceremony and they're going to  
do the judging for the floats and let's just 
tell you let me tell you i have my favorite  
i have two favorites three favorites we're 
gonna see if we can like make our way to the  
judging panel or something oh my hand's shaking 
we're not but it's fun let's see what's about guys
let's start to see
honey give me everything yeah
ah she's not letting him have it
work
in this category
all the judging the hooting and the hollering got 
us hungry and we're so amazed by the fact that  
they're providing food for all the spectators and 
judges and everyone who participated so they got
and before that we were just sitting there 
people came up to us asked about our channel  
we were talking got to know her name's 
becca she's so sweet so if you see this  
video thank you for your kindness like honestly 
it means a lot to us and then they offered us  
waters and burgers out of nowhere like come on the 
hospitality filipino people we can see it over and  
over and over again but to experience it guys it's 
insane like in the best way possible judgment time
i think buster 7 is going to
congratulations by the way you're amazing 
congrats so our friend here liloan introduces  
us to ricky here and i figured we'd 
give ricky the time to talk about  
what's happening here in liloan 
because it's truly like amazing okay  
so what just happened right you just witnessed 
uh the combination of our pride month
the beautiful ladies dressed in with all 
the flowers and what have you and also i  
initiated a program for the corrupt crime we're 
in uh all the members of the office for rocks  
here you you'll get to know 
you can find a way for rockets
so i initiated the pearl pride where 
they had to decorate this center with  
the rainbow colors just show cry and love for 
all that healthy and at the same time just you  
have witnessed we have also launched the nutrition 
month here in the philippines nutrition month is  
always july of course you have to be conscious 
about nutrition and health care for our kids  
and tonight we're going to be with you more 
oh we're excited we're going to put on their  
dancing shoes i'll try stilettos yes as you 
have seen earlier there were a lot of lettuce
all right so uh it started well here in asia 
basically the lgbt community has always been  
tolerated of knowledge a little 
bit tolerated and acknowledged but  
with our president mayor uh five six years ago 
she she has included everybody there was already  
inclusivity uh for everyone not just the regular 
citizens but also the you know the senior citizens  
the lgbt community the youth so we we were 
blessed with a mayor who is very progressive  
good and uh and got into the idea of being 
enthusiastic right so that's why we are putting  
kailashi or the government right now in milo and 
is putting highlight and accepting the community  
we've never really talked about our own personal 
stories i'm kind of a late bloomer in terms of  
coming out i didn't come out i was like 27. 
here's the thing at a very early age at age  
what three four i was going to kmart every friday 
and my parents would let me pick out a toy correct  
every toy i picked out was either 
a barbie or a my little pony  
my mom didn't care my dad didn't care in fact 
my dad would take me to this one store after  
school every wednesday or something it's like a 
resale shop and he would specifically point out  
the my little ponies like i will never forget 
that at all i grew up in a small town so we  
didn't really like there were a couple gay 
people openly gay people there was like  
they were older um so you didn't really like 
there there's no comfort in being who you are  
like you're always scared that you know people 
because you know when you're in school kids are  
saying oh that's so gay they talk down on 
everything and i'm already like one of very  
few black people in the entire community which 
they they were very like kind to me and accepting  
my point is i'm already like i already stand out 
and now let me add that layer of funness to it  
but i came out 27 to my mom i actually came up 
to my nephew and my sister first and they're  
like okay like they already knew it so thank 
god i grew up in a home that was very accepting  
i came to my mom i called her on the phone i 
was waiting for my sister outside and she like  
she's like okay i'm like mom okay and she 
started crying and then i started crying and  
she's like i love you just come home so i went 
home she came outside to the car got in the car  
and then she just gave the biggest hug and we 
were just crying and we went to go get dinner  
just drove around talking about it i never got to 
tell my dad um that i was or had that conversation  
with him before he passed but he knew uh he 
kind of alluded to it before he passed away  
that he knew and he left me for who i was which 
is really great and i guess the worst part of  
it is guys is that i wish i would have said 
something earlier but i didn't because i was  
scared of like everybody else when the reality 
is it's the people that are closest to you that  
i value their opinion more than anybody else's so 
i i grew up in a home that's very accepting very  
loving so looking back i wish i would have said 
something much earlier and even if they didn't  
accept me for who i was at the moment i know for 
a fact i would have at some point if you knew  
my mom especially you knew i could do no wrong 
whatsoever um recipes mom recipes dad i love you  
guys my story started at a young age i came out 
at the age of 18 but it wasn't intentional it was  
on a day when i was out with my friends and my 
brother was playing with my ipod yeah ipod and  
he found an app on there a gay dating app i'll 
let you guys answer that and he took the ipod  
to my mom just you know not knowing what 
it was and from there on later that evening  
when i walked into my home i got a different 
feeling like the environment was somewhat hostile  
and all i heard my mom say is like hey like 
your dad wants to talk to you when you get home  
or when he gets home from work uh later that night 
so he had dinner and soon afterwards he called me  
up to the front of the living room and if you guys 
know latinos are very strict they're very stuck  
to their ways and their religion being catholics 
they're you know it's a sin to be part of the lgbt  
community so when he brought it up to me there 
was a lot of disappointment and grief on his  
end because i felt like he was the one that failed 
the family for not raising me to be the man that  
i should have been and it was very hard because 
they didn't understand at that time and it was  
right before i was going to college so that summer 
i was put on like very strict roles of who i hung  
out with oh i went out with and so on so forth 
and it took about six years for them to finally  
understand who i was and that was just by seeing 
how happy i was with my job what i was doing i was  
living on my own no i wasn't living around i was 
living with them but they knew that i was seeing  
someone and i kept well as a secret for like five 
years five years six years five so they kind of  
insinuated who i was and we didn't really 
talk about it all they said like as soon  
as you're happy we're happy for you that's 
all we want in life and to hear those words  
felt really invigorating because that's all 
a child wants to hear from their parents  
it took them a while but i guess it was also they 
needed time to understand what it meant to be  
part of the lgbt community and as long as they 
see me happy then they'll be happy for me yeah  
all right guys so we showed you the parade which 
is amazing so now we're going to show you some  
of the perak so you can see the pride and all of 
that just so you guys know a barak is a smaller  
district within a neighborhood so every district 
every perak had the opportunity to show their  
pride by some form of art and we're going to see 
some of them and yeah just see the love that they  
put out all right let's go chase those rainbows 
let's go chase the rainbows rainbows and unicorns
be free with me
this was a nice surprise like the president of 
this barack invited us here like kind of come  
see all of their decorations and their showing 
of pride and she's going to tell us a little bit  
more about the lgbt community initiative within 
their district and show us what they've been up  
to as far as the resources and activities they 
have going on for the children here honestly like  
it's great to see it at a smaller scale of how 
accepting and welcoming they are to the community  
and how they want these children to be safe here 
in lilon this is only built a month ago oh my gosh
they said be yourself too 
that's one one of the art  
and then they have also came up with the 
pride month and this one they said it we  
should not be ashamed because we should 
love each other what is this eggshell
okay you guys take the cake 
i'm being very resourceful  
oh my god i love this i grew up we were very 
resourceful we didn't have a lot so we had to  
use whatever you could use so like this warms my 
heart because it just shows you don't need like  
lots of money to be creative or show something 
like it's all around us literally yeah yeah  
what made us like really happy yesterday was to 
see all these young filipino um boys and girls  
represent the community and whether they're part 
of the community or just allies to know that  
like this is the direction the philippines 
is going with we were geeking out so  
we appreciate it a lot and it's just 
going to get bigger and bigger and bigger  
every year we'll be doing this every june or 
yeah is it going to be june is always quite fun  
yes so i think we will start to be innovating 
more upgrading whatever we have the previous month  
because we want to be number one 
number three no we're number one  
all right guys that concludes our first pride 
in the philippines it took us by surprise to say  
the least i mean we have very we didn't have 
the highest expectations while we were here  
knowing that it's a small town but they showed 
out and just to see it in a smaller scale really  
shows like the improvement that's happening within 
communities for supporting the lgbt community and  
that just makes me happy i think the best takeaway 
from it all is that we've been to pride events  
before in chicago and they are mass evil like 
they do everything but you don't i think with  
the lilo on the smaller festival is that you get 
to actually see what it's all about i don't know  
if that makes sense but my point is you got to 
see the actual community members that are involved  
face to face you got to learn about why they're 
doing it how it's of the community the people  
that are actually fighting for these programs in 
the community it was just a more intimate thing  
and we had the best time we had the best time i 
felt very like a proud parent the entire time even  
though i had nothing to do with it whatsoever but 
and we're going to take that parent very literal  
because there was a dance later in the evening 
and by 9 30 we left the magella like we were  
so tired i'm like we're dad's here everybody else 
is so young and like we just look like dads yeah  
yeah we're not cool and a really quick shout 
out to carmen who is the president of the prop
yes roses means rose right yes okay yes thank you 
so much for inviting us to your community to come  
see what the youth put together to show their 
pride for the for the proc it was so resourceful  
and we love what you're doing and we hope every 
other community can like follow you soon and  
bring that to their communities as well at the 
end of the day we couldn't be any more proud for  
the filipino community here in lilola for their 
support in our community and i'm encouraging  
everyone out there to show their support not 
just the month of june but year-round because  
hey we're gay year-round not just in the month of 
june it shut off jose would not even exist after  
or before june no i'm kidding but 
like thank you and to anyone that  
out there that sees us whether you're 
gay straight whatever ally thank you  
if you are someone like that's gay lgbtq plus 
community be you be weird be feminine be masculine  
whoever you are be you there will 
always be people that advocate for you  
there will always be somebody out 
there that will like be your friend  
that has a love for you be you at the end of the 
day and if people don't accept you that's fine  
because there's so many people that will do it and 
this little community has shown us that there are  
just they're where you least expect it so yeah as 
lady gaga once said you were born this way baby  
referencing her we only reference britney on this 
channel but we'll reference her because it sounds  
really good but yeah thank you to everybody who
