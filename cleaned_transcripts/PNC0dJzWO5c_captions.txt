go to intramiros can we get a jeepney there 
we can also ride with the Jeep to interview  
us or we can get the LRT so there's two 
options oh we can get a grab but we'll  
go for the cheap option the traffic here is 
so busy it's crazy but this is a huge City
it's really creamy with the 
egg in the middle color flavor
here
good morning we're in Manila this is our first 
full day we arrived yesterday but we didn't have  
much time to see and do stuff but the traffic 
here is so busy it's crazy the population here  
is about 18 million so we're not going to be able 
to see a huge amount a day but we're certainly  
going to try and see as much as possible but 
you can see here this is it I think this is  
a jeepney so to get around in this city this 
is one of the most common forms of Transport  
so we're heading north today and we're heading to 
a place called intramuros that's our first stop  
we're staying in an area called Makati 
and it's going to take us about about  
an hour just over an hour to get up north 
to intramuros so we need to find the train  
station libertat so we're using Google 
Maps to try and get there but we'll show  
you a little bit of Manila and share our first 
impressions with you on the way there let's go
oh yes
spot next to next to the junction
I like it
so we have to drive that how much it costs 
yeah I think I'm gonna ask the guy oh okay
wow these roads are so busy
it's about 11 o'clock and we came out 
a little bit late because we thought we  
would try to miss rush hour but it's still hectic
hello do we pay now do we pay money 
now okay you pay now thank you
thank you
okay thank you
it's really easy yeah I think if you know 
where exactly we want to go just get this  
yeah but the thing is the problem is we 
don't know what is right should we find  
out yeah so it looks like all of the jeepneys 
have got their destination written on the side
so we need to head to a place called libertad  
to the train station we need to just 
move along here for the other people
we need to head to a station called libertat 
and then from there we're going to jump on the  
MRT line I think we need to wear a face mask 
I'll just put this on how long to deliver time
okay and then from there we want to go to 
intramuros can we touch the train to intramuros
thank you thank you yeah we can also ride with 
the Jeep to intramuros or we can get the LRT  
so there's two options oh we can get a grab but 
we'll go for the cheap option as always exactly
fascinating when you pay the uh when you pay 
the fare they just put the money and you have  
to hand out and I'll hand out until you get to 
the driver yeah I bet the driver want to get a  
chance to have a chance but now I'll touch it and 
we have to attend today and be another passenger  
yeah it looks like Jerry's got a job working on 
the jeepney now taking the cash from the customer
all right well that was easy we've made it to 
libertat and it was a 15-20 minute ride and it  
only cost 12 pesos which is really really cheap 
but from here we've just been taught that we can  
either get another jeepney to intramuros or 
we can get on the train so we're gonna find  
out what's the easiest option we're gonna ask and 
see if we can get some information from someone  
but this area is so busy there's so much going on
does it remind you of Bangkok 
at all yeah some area yeah yeah  
it's very different to Bangkok but if I was to 
compare it to another city I would definitely say  
that there's something I think to know these wires 
up here yeah those wires remind me of like Bangkok  
and Phuket and I think because there's so many 
people so much traffic it gives me a little bit of  
a feeling of Bangkok but it's definitely got its 
own feeling in its own atmosphere which is unique
so do you want to get the train or 
another jeepney okay right let me  
see if I can find out from someone where 
I get a Jeep into it let me ask this guy
tramiros can we get a jeepney there
okay we can take this one can we go to intramurals
okay thank you thank you
I love it vlogger yes yeah
it's called Always on a journey  
thank you thank you how much how much is this 
one how much should we pay uh okay 12 12.
it's really cheap thank you it is yeah 
yeah it's it's cool I like it it's  
so busy I'm just like oh so many 
things happening yeah it's good
the problem says
tomorrow we're flying to Cebu yeah
do I need to wear a mask
it's nice yes yes optional oh thank you thank you
okay so it took us three Japanese to get to 
intramural but the history of the jeepney is  
really interesting the jeepney is the it's the 
most popular form of Transport in all of Manila  
and it's easy to see why because it's really 
really cheap but I think one of the most and one  
of the easiest ways to integrate into a new city 
for me is to jump on public transport get involved  
mix with the law of people and I definitely feel 
now that I've arrived in Manila but with the GP  
the jeepney has actually been the most popular 
form of Transport since after the second world  
war the American GIS left the GP behind when they 
left the country and then local people started to  
convert the jeepney into a form of transport 
to take the local people around the city and  
it sits about 20 people so it is it is hot it 
is sweaty but it's cheap and I'll definitely be  
doing that again but the atmosphere as soon as I 
got off the jeepney just changed completely that  
gets really quiet and peaceful here but that 
was crazy um all I can say is we're in Manila  
so this part of the city feels completely 
different um it's not as popular as here and  
the atmosphere and the vibe that I get is just 
so much Karma but it's nice having the contrast  
between crazy hectic you could hear this you 
could see the cars and the traffic beep beep  
beep all the time it was really really intense 
but enjoyable I liked it but I feel exhausted
convenient I wonder how much this costs should 
we find out how much this costs to intramural  
it depends on where you want to go so yes okay 
how much is it two intramuros what's the price  
price we're going intramuros intramuros were 
uh we're not sure where we'll just walk are we  
are we not sure we're wearing them sorry oh okay 
we're okay we're okay thank you oh this is already
Okay so I was asking for a tricycle to intramuros 
but Jerry said that we're already in intramuros  
so I don't think we need any transport I think 
it's nice just to walk around and just have a  
look and see what the area is like oh yes yeah uh 
I'm okay thank you we just want to walk thank you
it lies in the heart of Manila and 
is known as intramuros it's known  
as the walled City and it's the oldest 
district and historic core of Manila  
one of the ways to explore intramuros is by 
taking a horse and cart ride these traditional  
horse-drawn carriages will take you on a leisurely 
tour of the old city but we chose to walk
thank you  
so immediately this area feels so different to 
what it does in the city center it feels a lot  
more peaceful that well the architecture of the 
buildings is completely different it just feels  
more laid back more chilled and you can catch your 
breath a little bit here yeah it seems really nice
hello how much is it 10 pesos 10 peso can I 
have one this please all together 2010 30 50.

Restorations throughout the centuries but 
it still retains its Grandeur and beauty

Church sorry oh my God we're just walking to San  
Agustin right in front of me okay the San Agustin 
church was built in 1571 this Baroque style church  
is the oldest Stone Church in the Philippines and 
has been declared as a UNESCO world heritage site
Okay so we've got the tickets for Fort Santiago 
and it was 75 pesos per person to get inside hello  
Fort Santiago is a military Fortress that 
was built during the Spanish colonial era  
it's witnessed several important events 
in Philippine history including the  
imprisonment and execution 
of national hero Jose Rizal
this is also a great place to enjoy a leisurely 
walk along the walls the walls were built to  
protect the city from foreign Invaders 
and offer a panoramic view of Manila Bay
we found a restaurant called pepitos 
and it looks really busy it looks like  
there's a lot of people in there and 
the prices look really really good
foreign
the sauce is delicious
cold water oh that's really nice  
I think you really like the chicken 
because it's sweet and spicy
all night at first you can taste the sweet tea and  
then later you can taste a 
little spicy after oh wow

try this I've read about this this sausage um

it's really creamy nice yeah
I like that a lot yeah
it's really creamy with the egg in the 
middle color flavor I like everything

cheap it was it was 205 pesos I thought it was  
going to be double that everything was delicious 
sausage is definitely my favorite and I'm  
definitely gonna have that for breakfast again in 
the future and this is lovely I would definitely  
recommend coming to pepitos cheap food but very 
delicious okay let's go next floor this is my  
favorite oh really uh it's very spicy rice amazing 
yeah really good that was absolutely wonderful I  
would highly recommend visiting intramuros when 
you're in Manila it felt like I was seven back in  
time it just felt like the buildings are really 
all all buildings and then the tricycles and the  
jeepney and the horse and cart riding around there 
just really Blended in perfectly with the church  
the cathedral and the fort it was wonderful 
and I would definitely definitely visit again
and our next stop we're heading to a place now 
called Rizzle Park it's about a 20 to 25 minute  
walk from here the weather's still perfect so 
we're just gonna walk rather than get on a jeepney  
or get into a tricycle because the scene was just 
so lovely and this is Russell Park actually it's  
a lot closer to intramuros than we thought it 
hasn't taken us 20 minutes to walk here it's  
taken maybe about 10 but this is beautiful it's 
so peaceful the the garden here is really well  
maintained really well kept it's wonderful and 
the weather's perfect for this park today as well
hello hello
thank you for visiting here oh thank you thank you 
it's a pleasure it's very beautiful thank you this  
58 Hector Park offers a variety of attractions 
and activities for visitors to enjoy it features  
iconic landmarks such as the Rizzle Monument 
Chinese and Japanese Gardens and a man-made Lagoon  
visitors can also enjoy cultural performances 
and live music at the concert at the Park area  
Rizzle Park is a must visit destination that 
showcases the Philippines Rich cultural heritage  
yeah so one of the wonderful things that we've 
recognized already is the city itself is just so  
diverse it's like obviously there are parts of the 
city which are crazy extremely busy with lots of  
people lots of traffic then coming to intramuros 
the atmosphere completely changes and it's a much  
slower pace of Life still really busy but then 
look at this and if you want a little bit of  
Tranquility then there's this park it's just it's 
wonderful I didn't know what to expect from Manila  
um I didn't have any expectations but it's 
wonderful we're really enjoying our time here  
oh it looks like we can get some freshly 
made lemonade here let's try this
oh it's mango
I wonder what the difference is between 
the blue blue lemonade blue lemonade
