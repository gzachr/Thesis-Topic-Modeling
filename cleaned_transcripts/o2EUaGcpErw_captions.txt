BALABAC  ISLANDS -  the Philippines final frontier
These magnificent islands where you will feel that time stands still
and you will often forget exactly where in the world you are
a little piece of paradise that looks 
like a remote heaven in Polynesia or Fiji 
is still one of those off the beaten 
path destination in the Philippines
BALABAC islands are considered the final frontier 
of the Philippines because of their location 
they are located in the beautiful SULU SEA in Southern Palawan
and they are considered an integral part of it,
but they are more close to Malaysia than 
any other place in the entire Philippines
Having experienced the 4 days and 3 nights 
Island Hopping Expedition between El Nido and Coron
 in our previous visit to the Philippines (which we absolutely loved by  the way)
this time we really wanted to do the same in the more remote islands of Balabac  
So join us in the next few episodes of our Philippine Series
 where we will tell   you and show you all you need to know 
about visiting this amazing Paradise called Balabac islands
To get to Balabac you will need to fly from Manila to Puerto Princesa  
and usually your tour operator will book a van 
to take you to Buliluyan Port in the Southern tip of Palawan
From there you will board the boat, 
which can vary in size according to the tour you booked 
You can book a private tour or join a tour
Our preference was a private tour as we wanted to film the entire  adventure
So we needed the freedom of time and itinerary
The easiest way to get to Balabac islands is by booking a tour
Nowadays there are multiple companies running 
island hopping tours in Balabac 
We also recommend flying into Puerto Princesa the night before
as the van will pick you up very early around 5 6 am
So here we are in the van towards Buliluyan Port
Sleepy, but also very excited for the days ahead
Once we reached Buliluyan Port, our tour guide Willy 
was already waiting for us us together with the boat men
 The tour can be either 3 or 4 days long
We have  done 4 days, because on your last 
day you will only return to Port Buliluyan  
 and then to Puerto Princesa, without visiting any other Islands
Canimeran  Island - first stop of our tour in Balabac
it's just two more boats, it's okay, it's very quiet
we're gonna explore the island
and we already saw baby shark!
but we well we didn't uh
put her back somewhere more far
Not a bad first stop, not at all!
In case you're wondering you will never 
see me without the aqua shoes again 
So last time when we took the same expedition 
in Linapacan, on a clear water like this  
I was just, you know stepping in the water, minding 
my thing, and then suddenly I felt a very strong pinch
And then it was bleeding and then I didn't 
know what happened 
and basically George was taking a GoPro movie of me - excuse me 
and you can see in the video how crab you know just goes away
at another look it looks more like a stingray 
so if you're gonna observe him now in the top  
left corner not sure if it's a crab or 
a stingray but Whoever has experience  
highly appreciated if you just tell us 
in the comments what do you think it was  
if you're someone in the Sands were 
probably stepped very close to him
and self so luckily I had the shoes but even 
though through the shoes he still managed  
to cut my toe imagine what would have happened 
without it so yeah especially in areas like this  
where there are a lot of sea urchins and other 
creatures like that is vested do as much as you  
can to protect yourself because you don't want to 
ruin your your trip right so you're in a remote  
ish location so it takes some time until you 
can get some medical help and there's George
love me
foreign
there's a glow inside ready to begin
just me
this is where our dreams begins
foreign
Island here we are at our second 
stop for the day Dolphin Island  
you will see soon in our drone video 
why is the island called like this
we asked the guys if we could have some Buco 
so they went up the tree to get some for us  
and we're just gonna walk 
around the island a bit wow
is it
straight up I need shadow right here
oh so sunny
one hour yeah only one hour on this 
island Dolphin Island they say yeah
we're heading back afterwards to the 
base camp which is two hours away you  
know yeah yeah so now it's 2 35 so 
probably around 4 35 we should be  
at the base camp and probably we're 
gonna sleep during these two hours
okay
yeah the water is a bit cooler here I think
I think it's the current but it feels good
where's the baby shark
okay what do you wanted to say
one make their skin less white
foreign
I can't be happier than I am right now 
than I am right now I can't be happier  
than I am right now than I am right now thank you
after spending the day on these two 
beautiful islands it was time to hit  
the road towards our final destination our 
base camp so we made it to the base camp
okay time to move the luggages
so this is our A-frame A-frame for the next 
three nights we're gonna show you around uh  
tomorrow tomorrow morning tomorrow morning 
now it's there's a lot of activities uh  
yeah it's gonna be videoke karaoke and 
uh dinner time so I'm gonna show you a  
bit where are the facilities like shower 
toilet and so on so let's hit the road
we could lay out a blanket on the grass 
look up and let the world fade away
Take the Long Way Home
what do we have here hello come on [ __ ] [ __ ] 
no I didn't convince her to communicate with me
it's karaoke time and also 
sunset time one two three
this is our base camp
that you can rent a few hats goodbye
this is our Hut
so we had our snack which was a very very 
delicious I'm thinking about Buko that's who I am  
saying it because the sticky rice 
and now we cannot end the day without  
another snorkel session we don't have high 
expectations but let's see what we can find
there was mostly seaweed in the 
water next to our campsite but  
we will take any opportunity we can get to 
practice our free diving skills a bit more
so we we are walking a bit just 
before sunset killing time on  
the Main Beach of our campsite white Beach 
just walking around to see what else is here  
and on the on the end on that tip there's still 
a bit of sunshine so we will go check it out yeah
sand is so fine  
foreign
houses
no trespasses
shipping containers from the sea and we wanted to 
check it out I think it's a hotel more more than  
housing so guys this was definitely not a 
housing project but a new Hotel chain being  
built and safeguarded by Iron Man we've been 
told that we are not allowed to even walk on  
their Beach which we found very strange but we 
just bent back to our campsite to avoid trouble
grilled fish yeah it's so good 
and then you have cut shrimps
shrimp stir fry fruits rice
after a delicious dinner it was time to go to 
bed and rest for the island hopping day ahead  
see you guys in our next episode when we will 
be exploring the one and only onok Island
