what's up man what's up what's up 
what's up what's up did you where are we  
in Manila in Manila we are in Manila in the 
center of the people in the center of the world  
we are in the middle of the street and 
we're walking and we already have a club
gold I don't have gold man I'm sorry 
I'm a poor Romanian boy Romania
what's up
another boy outside hello
oh man the fuel are so friendly over here you 
just walked on the street and the random people  
are saying hello to you and kids are running after 
you I'm starting to like Philippines more and more  
if money lies like this I wonder how the rest 
of the country is oh man Gigi I miss this kind  
of commotion and agitation and colorfulness of 
the area around because so far in Indonesia it  
was nice but it was mostly beaches and islands 
and in Thailand as well nice but very clean and  
very quiet and here all of a sudden everything 
started coming back to life I mean you have all  
sorts of things yeah Vehicles you have cars 
you have bikes you have people you have big  
do not delay perishable Goods cars everything 
is happening here and we're in the middle of  
the people and somehow getting run over by a car 
and I found Gigi again the fact that of the street
s
yes they are very wide and very big and very clean 
I mean of course it's a bit of a commotion and  
everything but we've been to other places like 
uh Summit as of India like Karachi in Pakistan  
and it was way more dirty in some places than here 
here look life and the people are friendly right  
easy yeah and I love the fact that on the side of 
the road you have this kind of activity going on  
I mean you have food places you have snack places 
speaking of which I need to get myself a snack
right even though you don't realize
speaking of motherhood mommy Mariana
it's green it kind of reminds 
me of Sting but let's see
okay

very good cobra and if you think I think 
it's my favorite one in the Philippines

chemicals needed for a perfect energy concoction 
this next recording is unknown but in the footage  
we see a guy exploring on the backpack thank 
you so much have a nice day okay let's continue  
GG going through thank you for the banana very 
good banana hello doggy okay and just like that  
we heard ourselves a snack and some juice and 
we're ready to face the day that way that way  
my goodness it's so crowded today it's a lot of 
noise what day is today Tuesday yes he's in the  
middle of the week and all the people have this 
come outside of their house yeah and we're now  
in a kind of a car service kind of place bike shop 
I don't know how did we end up here we just walked  
we just walked exactly so we just walked outside 
of our house and this happened we're in the middle  
of the streets in the middle of the people and 
look at you there's a kitten yeah there's a kid oh
the good little kitten okay 
interesting kind of area we have here
what's up foreign
so far what is your first impression about Manila 
I mean literally we just walked outside of the  
house I want to feel your first first feeling 
about this country like this is the thing to  
be noted here guys we're in the old school 
district of Manila the real heart and soul  
of Manila there are like modern territories here 
in Manila as well because it's a huge Metropolis  
it has more than 30 million people but we are 
in the heart and soul of Manila and this is  
where you come to see and feel they are actually 
the life of the people and uh so far okay okay
interesting random Jeep in the middle of the 
street this is like yeah I don't think you  
can see anything like this in other sides of 
Manila people are super friendly I don't think  
you see anything like this in other sides of 
the world did you I don't know it's first time  
I'm seeing a Jeep like that ever very well 
welcoming people they're amazing I mean the  
roads look really really nice of course like 
the old city center looks a bit like old but  
it's it's quite vast I mean you have a lot of 
space around here to move the traffic is okay  
it's not pretty crazy yet uh that's why I don't 
know if we have here um some sort of an LRT or  
something uh we do remember when we came inside 
the country try to take the LRT but no I'm here  
ah here in this area no idea GG I have no idea 
I'm just walking down the street with no plan
you fired I think we have to go that way
look at this fire truck for some reason 
kinda reminds me of the American types  
okay interesting I heard that a lot of the cars 
here in the Philippines and especially in Manila  
are kind of like American Vibe ish and so far 
this one looks the same even though it's a Hino  
which is like a Asian one okay interesting it's a 
very refreshing feeling here I know like the only  
things I know about vanilla and Philippines are 
is the fact that they were considered once upon  
a time or still are like the pearl of the East 
and uh that the people are very welcoming uh  
and the fact that it's a huge City and religion 
is Christianity well as we saw the people they  
were very welcoming now we're about to see how 
the rest of the city looks like I have a hunch  
that uh it's gonna be interesting based 
upon the scenery around here hello
oh nice okay okay
how would you stay here so 
far so good it's pretty close
no I'm sorry in English
somewhere there people uh I don't know yeah
oh you're in the wrong man
hello thank you Kevin Lowe do you 
know him a basketball player I assume
there we go
do you want to get a tattoo uh not right here
my first home that's it
oh nice okay I think to it's time 
to leave before I embarrass myself
have a nice day thank you bye 
bye enjoy playing did you look  
look this is such a cool graffiti face 
amazing I like Manila I like it a lot
did you take a look at this 
contrast I mean the streets  
of Manila and then you have this kind 
of birds custom furniture and whoa okay
this is a Lambo or some kind of a humble inside of 
a shop that's so cool yo wow this is CBD Furniture  
okay Manila keeps surprising us more and more 
and more and outside it's Brewing up for a storm
