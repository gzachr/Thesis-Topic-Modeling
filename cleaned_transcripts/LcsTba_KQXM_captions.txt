all right today i'm going to try american 
food here in the philippines i am in makati  
which is a city right next to manila 
and yeah if you saw my previous video  
then you know i had a little food poisoning but 
today i'm actually feeling all right again but  
yeah i don't want to stress my stomach 
too much so i thought um i'm going to  
eat something that my stomach is known to so 
i'm going to eat western food slash american  
food today i heard about an american diner which 
looks very interesting let's head over there  
and check it out and see how the american 
food here in the philippines tastes like
actually i also just called the motorbike taxi but 
yeah i don't know why but this app never seems to  
work it's called joyride but i'm searching for a 
long time already and i can't find a taxi and it's  
always like this so i don't know if this app ever 
works like this there are two guys on the street  
uh i don't know what actually they are doing 
waving away the traffic but we do have working  
traffic lights here so i'm actually not sure 
why there are two guys on the streets doing that  
but yeah i need to across the street 
here yeah this is like the the center  
of uh makati at least i think so i haven't been 
here for that long but uh yeah we have all these  
huge buildings here they look actually quite 
modern oh there's a nice pool up there as well  
hello hello what are you selling here what 
is this flower how much you sell them for
thank you so much what do you 
use this for it's for good luck
oh i don't have more small i don't have you can  
ah thank you thank you oh now i missed the 
green light because i got distracted by  
this uh lady selling your flowers here and 
okay then we can cross over here as well
yeah i started to always have some change 
in my pockets when i'm walking around the  
town here because yeah you actually see a 
lot of um poor people here on the streets  
um and yeah they're like selling 
something to make some extra money then uh  
why don't support them a little bit as 
long as they are friendly and not like  
super pushy you know i don't have a problem with 
that um okay everybody is moving so i can move too
okay yeah see this guy is 
like what actually is he doing
and there's a second guy here as well  
i'm not sure why they are here when we have 
working traffic lights here but uh okay
okay that's funny now he just told us we 
can go although we still have a red light
all right and we have the diner over there and 
you know what's funny when you have a look at this  
street on google maps google maps tells me that 
this street is known for being at red light area  
i never saw that advice before on google maps 
and if i look around yeah we have a club here  
a bar but doesn't really look like a typical red 
light area maybe it does in the night i don't know  
but we have arrived filling station burger fries 
steaks pizza hollywood los angeles freeway oh this  
looks very american so far let's see where's the 
entrance actually is it over here i think it is
hello i can come and play do you have someone no 
just one i guess one plus one okay i go upstairs
oh check this out we have a motorbike here  
there's music in the background which 
is sounds like it's from the 60s wow
oh i like it here so far
oh the atmosphere here is 
great so do i enter here now
hello

oh wow can can i sit over here here okay
okay let's have a look at the menu okay the 
first thing i see is milkshakes smoothies  
oh yeah pancakes waffles american breakfast 
here or even a filipino breakfast okay  
oh wow after having a bad stomach for several days  
this actually looks like heaven to me 
at the moment steaks burgers here oh wow  
and of course a pizza and pasta  
all right i have decided i'm going to get 
an american classic pancake and of course a  
burger as well so two american classics i think 
all-american burger imported us beef patties
i would like to have an all-american 
burger and pancake banana
today
wow i absolutely love the atmosphere here the 
music in the background it adds so much atmosphere  
and yet the food has arrived so i look at 
my table now i'm having a huge burger here  
it looks very delicious huge portion of fries as 
well and then as a dessert i'm going to have this  
amazing looking pancake here with bananas on top 
with ice cream on top cute little american flags  
here looks very delicious so this meal after 
a few days of being sick with a sick stomach  
salt and pepper here maybe the 
pies can take a little bit more  
look at the huge beep at ucr oh amazing
wow this is a decent
okay the burger is gone and my stomach 
is already quite full i have to say  
but um the pancake just looks so 
delicious wow yeah i'm not an american um  
i'm actually from germany so i'm not an expert 
about american food but i have been to the united  
states two times in my life i actually have an 
uncle who lives there for over 20 years and he  
went to the navy he's married to an american 
woman so uh yeah i don't really know much about  
american food i'm not an expert about that but i 
know that pancakes is a classic in america right  
so these actually look quite well quite 
nice fluffy let's try bananas first  
for the ice cream
i think it's the ice cream 
to be honest i think it's hot
great
oh no it's not ice cream wow  
i thought it's ice cream so i just ate it 
like vanilla ice cream but actually butter  
so there was a huge chunk of butter in my mouth 
wow that was a tail but yeah fluffy pancake
i'm not sure what this is maybe honey as well it's 
not really that sweet but it's very delicious oh i  
love this meal like first proper meal in a few 
days past days i had a lot of instant noodles  
okay i have to give up the two pancakes 
are too much i finished one and a half  
pancakes and they are so heavy well my stomach 
is about to explode at least that's how i feel  
but wow it was very very delicious and yeah like i 
said before i absolutely love the atmosphere here  
this typical american diner atmosphere 
the fitting music in the background  
wow this was a nice experience but yeah let's 
see how much this speed is going to cost me
okay so i just paid the bill the bill was 750 
pesos for two meals actually i was expecting it  
to be a higher so the prices are yeah of course 
higher than usual in the philippines but yeah  
you pay for the for the atmosphere here and of 
course restaurant food is always more expensive  
than local food all right let's have a look around
