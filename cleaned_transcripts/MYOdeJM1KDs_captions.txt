After visiting the Santiago Fort, Now we are ready to go to China Town in Manila
And we have hired this little Tricycle for 150 Peso which has a capacity of 3 people, let's see how is it
Look at Shila, where she is sitting on Tricycle
it's now evening time, we have reached China Town from that old city by traveling a lot in Tricycle
In most of the countries in the world, there are China Towns, which is why China Town exists in Manila as well
but this China Town in Manila is basically like a shopping mall, let's go inside and see what it offers
But you will see Chinese language signs and Chinese people in the surrounding of this place
This is China Town, but looks like a shopping mall, very unusual, because normally China Towns are not like this
Everything is available here from Vegetables to Cosmetics and garments
We are here at a shopping mall called "999" where we can find the cheapest garment items i.e T-shirts or pants
we have entered this local shopping mall called "999", I think it's a wholesale as well as retail market here
I have to buy some t-shirts here, let's see for how much we can buy the t-shirts here
it is very crowded market, this market has many products to offer especially garments items
There are toys shops, food court here, and see the crowd. it's weekend that's why too many people.
People in the Philippines love two things the most, Food and Shopping and they spend most of their money on these two, you can see the crowd here for shopping.
Massage is also available here viewers
As you can see the market is low priced, similarly the massage service is also very cheap here 150 Peso
If you like Chinese food then come here to this place
There are many wholesale markets here, it's very big market in Manila
okay viewers, so it was a hectic day today, we visited many places in Manila using public transport
We used jeepneys, we used tricycle and also I used Grab to come to my hotel after completing the trip
Noman and Shilla have gone back and I came back to my hotel here in Makati
You can check their channel in description, Shila is also a tour guide here in Philippines, so you can hire her
And the conclusion is that, traffic is very jam in Manila and you have to be very careful about timings
Always try to start your journey before 1 or 2 hours in Manila to reach your place on time
Try to use motor bike which is good to avoid traffic in Manila and it's also cheaper option
Grab taxi is also available here easily, we couldn't use train today, but I will use that some other day
So guys, thank you very much for watching this video and I will see you with another video tomorrow.
