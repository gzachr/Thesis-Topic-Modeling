hi my name's josie i'm in the philippines late 
last night after a long day at the airport we  
landed in the philippines in clarke airport we 
got our luggage and then since we'd never been  
here before we realized we weren't exactly sure 
where to go so we've arrived in clarke and now  
we just have to find a way to get to manila until 
we found some friendly locals to help us get to  
manila so we we're getting help here to get to 
manila from these lovely gentlemen we just got  
here we just got to the philippines i'm really 
excited they're going to help us get to manila  
people are good very good we're 
excited they're so friendly already  
then we had a three hour drive to our 
hotel in mccarty welcome back to my  
channel all welcome if you're new here my 
name is josie and today is my first time  
first day first everything here in the 
philippines i'm so excited let's go explore manila
so this is our first day in manila 
and we're right now in the makati  
area but before we go explore as 
always i need a coffee let's go
oh now's good i need a coffee as soon as possible
okay so we're here in yardstick and we just got 
a breakfast bagel as well as a couple of coffees  
i always start my day with a coffee 
and apparently this was the place to be  
one thing i noticed is everyone is 
so friendly whether it's here or in  
the airport when we got here it's really really 
cool oh another thing i found really interesting  
is that they have banned straws here in makati so 
you get your coffee with like a fold back top and  
it's kind of like a sippy cup i really actually 
like it so we just came from singapore for three  
days and i don't think we were staying in the park 
that had like a really large coffee culture and i  
love coffee so coming from there where we couldn't 
really find a place to get it and coming to this  
which looks like a real coffee well it is 
a real coffee shop but you know what i mean  
in the philippines i'm so excited 
to see how this tastes ready
that is what i am talking about 
so yeah and now i come alive
it's good it's good it's good what else do i say 
it's obviously not as much of a copy snob as me
okay we're full of coffee it's good actually  
how much is it twenty twenty people 
yeah okay hi are you going hello hello
she said we're trying to find banana cute she said 
she only has bananas like here who are you from
what color is 20. do you have a 20 yeah you got 
it this one okay you get one which one's good  
do you pick one any one go for it thank you 
so much so we're on the hunt for banana queue  
but uh i think there's some in these vendors down 
here but i bought a banana anyway i like bananas  
thank you so much for your 
help one of them for death  
oh i'll show you josie where's 
my phone oh where's my phone  
oh yes oh it's in my arm also if you don't 
find a banana you can hide that what is that  
that's uh banana grease banana is a 
brown sugar but it is wrapped oh yeah  
it's it tastes like it also tastes 
like banana what is it banana rum
perfect all right i'll try and look 
for that one as well thank you so much  
thank you thank you thank you for your help
see you bye bye everyone here is 
so friendly tree oh there's a tree  
no matter where we've gone there's someone that's 
helped us the whole way like that's so cool i just  
asked them for banana queue and he like took me 
down the street to these vendors tried to find  
it for me he was speaking to them in like filipino 
to try and like help me find banana queue in that  
airport the other day they were like helping 
us the policeman or the security was helping us  
find a taxi driver as well and he was so friendly 
everyone here the whole day has been so friendly  
alright so i just know from being in thailand for 
six months that the fruit growing in this area of  
like on the globe is just a little bit nicer 
than where we're from but let's try this filipino  
banana smell it's more yellow it does look more 
yellow and it's more it smells a lot different  
it kind of smells like the leaf as well it does 
that make sense that's different all right ready
it's so sweet that is so good i love sweet i can 
pull it through my mask it smells it smells so  
strong the smell of this banana like before i 
even open the skin i could pretty much smell it  
i love that okay now i've had a real banana let's 
go find one of the two sort of sweet street food  
type of bananas you can get here hopefully banana 
cube let's see what we can find what's this  
spring roll how much is it 20. just take one
thank you thank you all right so we've got these 
like spring rolls i think they said they were  
vegetarian and he asked me for some sauce and 
i said the lady i said sweet and i said yes  
and then he said spicy and i i said a little 
bit but i didn't want any so that was my fault  
crazy oh a little bit so this might be fun because 
if you're new here i'm not very good at spicy food  
so let's try oh they're really cute there's 
like two of them in this car all right let's try
oh i really like that probably the most fried one 
that i've had like spring roll that i've had ever  
in my life that's a nice spring roll i really 
like it dumps the sauce in the bottom of a cup  
so you have that to dip in the whole time and then 
i guess you just throw this in the bin but that's  
a really cool way to do it instead of having two 
like containers like one for sauce and one for  
them just put it in there that's really smart 
so there is something i've noticed about the  
philippines and that's the food trucks on the 
side of the road they're quite different to in  
thailand in thailand you'd have like a vendor 
with something attached to like their scooter  
or something like that or their bike but here in 
the philippines i've noticed that there's trucks  
on the side of the road and then you get your 
food and kind of stand and eat on the side of  
the truck but that's a big difference that i've 
noticed um here just walking down the street  
in mccarty already so just on the way now to get 
a sim card i actually got one at the airport just  
so we could get some data to get to our hotel 
and whatnot but obviously what's the first thing  
that you do when you get to a new country is get 
internet access and things like that so if you're  
coming to the philippines for the first time i'll 
just quickly show you what we're doing but the one  
thing else that i've noticed about here is that 
there's so many western or like chain stores hi hi
everyone's so friendly there's so 
many chain stores and things and  
there's like duncans team hortons subway 
lawson there's so many different kinds kfc  
there's so many trains here as well so that's 
another thing that i've noticed all of the  
popular things that i think you might get from 
home depending on where you are are here so this  
is really cool we're walking down one of the main 
streets here in mccarty in manila it wouldn't be  
out of place in like sydney or bangkok or like 
a massive international city it's so clean the  
buildings are like so impressive and extraordinary 
and like just good looking population yeah  
one thing that's different to hear about any 
other agency that i've been to is there is  
bins for your rubbish every like 30 meters yeah 
you never find that in a lot of places in south  
east asia it's really hard to find somewhere 
to put your rubbish or you're holding on to it  
for half an hour until you find somewhere or you 
go to a shop with one there's one here five meters  
away and there's one here about 20 meters away 
i'm aware that not the whole country obviously  
looks like this but this is so impressive right 
here so we're just walking down this main road and  
we're just trying to find the ayala triangle so 
we're gonna go on the way there but before we get  
there as we're on the way consider pressing the 
subscribe button to my channel it really helps me  
with the algorithm and youtube and also like the 
video while we're on the way so let's go thank you
so just walk into the ayala triangle right now 
but we've seen this statue right in the middle of  
the road and i can't get close enough to read 
what it says because there's a gate here in the  
road there so if you know what this is or 
what this means in mccarty and manila let  
me know because that looks pretty important but 
i don't know what it means and i'd like to know
so we're just coming into the ayala triangle now 
and it's so beautiful i can't believe there's  
just a park this beautiful clean green vibrant in 
the middle of this massive city this is so pretty  
and also we just walked past outside and we had 
like guards and security guards being like hi  
how are you hi the people here are so friendly 
everyone's tried to help us say hello and this  
is such a beautiful park they've got bikes at the 
front that i think you can like hire or use with  
an app if you want to as well so if you want 
to ride around on a bike you can also do that
it's actually started to rain 
now so i have an umbrella  
and it's only been a couple of minutes for you 
on the vlog but it's been a few hours for me so  
i need another coffee we're gonna head there 
now and then we're gonna find some street food  
we're gonna find the banana cube and 
we're gonna go from there maybe find some  
local filipino food if we can as well 
for our first impression first day
i can't how are you gonna press the 
button pull it down oh my god i got it
give it here
thank you so we're walking in the rain and we 
found this really cute coffee shop it's really  
pretty but we thought we'd just stop wait 
for the rain to pass have a coffee energize  
ourselves before we go and find some more food 
to eat here because it's now late afternoon and  
i'm starving they brought out my iced cappuccino 
and it's got like four little cats or something  
in the top in the top and then they've got the 
name of it down on the foam in the saucer as well
so we just finished up at the coffee shop i 
was actually quite disappointed with my coffee  
i had an iced cappuccino so maybe that's just not 
their specialty um yardstick from this morning was  
a lot better so of the two i'd recommend yardstick 
but we're just on the way now it's busy so busy  
i was just on the way now to get the banana queue 
and then also some local fruit because we are  
absolutely starving we've 
been out all day so let's go
we found banana q and the other one as well that's 
so exciting so we're gonna have two and there's  
not much there's not ash left so we're gonna get 
two and then one well is this one called again  
yeah perfect and what is it 
it's got bananas with water
oh
how much was it again 40 pesos 
40 pesos all right i have 20.
getting there lots of colors thank you so much 
have a good day this banana is from our brothers  
oh thank you oh thank you so much bye 
thank you have a good day i got bananas
she gave me bananas that was the sweetest thing 
that was what i'm talking about like everyone here  
is so friendly and so nice she gave us bananas 
like for free as we'll walk away she's just like  
have some bananas let's try the turon and the 
banana cube we've been looking for all day so  
we're gonna try the banana q first it's basically 
like oh it's like a barbecue banana they maybe  
they deep fry i don't know leave in the comments 
below but they definitely rub like sweetener or  
like sugar or something over it but it's more like 
a barbecued banana type thing it smells like sugar  
it smells like sugar like
oh that's different okay so it
that's so good is it good yeah it's kind of like  
thick it's like bread sort of i've 
never tasted anything like this
whoa it's so sweet you can taste 
like the sugar and the like glaze  
of sugar or the glaze like the 
sugar glaze or something oh wow
yum so this is banana turon so 
from my understanding it's a banana  
but it's sort of wrapped more in like a like 
a spring roll wrap and it's got the sugar on  
the outside so same kind of deal but i guess a 
little bit different let's try this one somehow oh
okay i like this one you get like 
a crunch like a this one's good
this is nice this is really nice you get a crunch 
from the wrap and it's almost like deep fried but  
it's not the crunch is also the glaze of the 
sugar on the outside as well as they're like  
wrap being crispy and crunchy as well and 
then you've got the banana on the inside i  
think this is less banana you're right it's like 
a little kick of banana which is like just enough  
this is more pastry than banana i love this 
one so tell me in the comments below are you  
team banana queue are you team banana tour 
rock because oh i think i'm banana turon
yo what's a bengus i don't know huh what's like  
local do you think what's 
good what's your favorite
or if you love it oh people gotta get it briefcard
okay so we asked her what was her favorite or 
what i should get and i ended up with the beef  
curry curry curry curry which i'm not sure 
what it is so if you do know let me know down  
below she asked me if i like peanut butter and i 
said yes as well so i think that's what this is  
um i don't think that's what that is i think 
it's in there i don't know what that is um but  
we're gonna try with the rice pick up a piece of 
the beef and the like soup uh curry sort of stuff  
and try it it reminds me a little bit of like 
maximum curry i don't know i haven't had massimo  
curry that often but it's the like soft beef that 
kind of falls apart in your mouth with the curry  
sauce with the rice it does remind me of maximum 
beat my teeth just slides through the beast  
it's like falling apart in my mouth it's really 
really soft obviously tender i really like it  
it's my first like dish in the philippines my 
first like filipino dish this is cool side note  
look how cute my little coke is it's tiny i'm so 
cute i love this because we're sitting here eating  
and everyone else has their tables like facing 
towards the tv and they're just watching the  
news or the weather or something on there 
they're having a great time this is awesome  
it's like a little shop on the side of the road 
right next to where we're staying and it looks  
really local i'm really impressed with this meat i 
really like it so that's it for my first day here  
in manila in the philippines from the food to the 
people to the culture to the coffee to everything
