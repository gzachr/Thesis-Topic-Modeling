and garlic powder and i will massage this into  
the meat spread it evenly now the friend that 
is going to try the baboy today is Chinese he  
knows a lot about delicious food and even has 
experience with dishes from the philippines

ako oh i love the star anise these are so nice  
i'm going to add a few with a few bay leaves 
and shallots these are mini sibuyas i don't  
know the Tagalog word for this but we're gonna 
steam this in the oven at 170 degrees celsius  
for a little more than two hours two hours long 
in the meantime i'm making a delicious salad  
with delicious cucumber and delicious dressing
