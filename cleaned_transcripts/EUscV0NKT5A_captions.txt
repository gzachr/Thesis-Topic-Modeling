hey Rodrigo down like this will
rain freeze too see you Rodrigo
Philippines hello hello and welcome back
to another video my first full day here
in the beautiful country of Philippines
and in the hustling and bustling city of
Manila so guys we're going to be taking
you on an adventure today to share with
you what my first impressions are
exploring this place
while I got a small impression of it
last night I haven't really been able to
explore too much of it just yet oh we
got the big shotgun right there and uh
right on that guard right behind me and
so yeah guys we're gonna be sharing with
you what it's like to explore this place
what it's like coming here with pretty
much not that much knowledge I've seen
some Filipino Vlogs in the past friends
that have been here but other than that
uh never been and uh so excited to be
here so we're gonna walk probably like
40 minutes away over to like Riza Park
area and see what we explore on the way
over there it's about 9 00 a.m so it's
like uh just starting the busyness of
the day here we've got people all on the
streets here walking around and getting
ready a lot of shops are still closed at
this hour in the morning but uh
seems like the restaurants and things
are starting to open up
I'm up kind of bright and early today
got up nice and early so I can make sure
that I'm able to uh explore as much of
this city as I can while the sunlight's
still up
so I'm ready to take you guys with for
this adventure so guys a little more
about Manila if you're not familiar with
the city it is a city that actually has
a bunch of different cities all in the
metropolitan area and the population is
about 23 million people and let me tell
you just walking around this place you
can feel it we're probably wondering
where I am at the moment I'm actually
kind of in the Chinatown area binando I
believe is how it's pronounced and it's
actually the oldest Chinatown in the
world so it's cool to be staying here
got recommended by um my buddy Ian who I
work with who's from the Philippines he
said this area would be a good place to
explore and check out so we're doing the
uh kind of walking tour by foot with a
bit of an open itinerary to see how the
day is going to turn out today I don't
have any specific plans in mind other
than walking to a couple big landmarks
and sharing with you the culture and the
interactions and life in Manila on my
way over there
so it looks like right over here we've
got some uh delicious Street Food
going on freshly made
food here just a bit
just a bit with all breakfast at the
hotel so just need to uh burn off those
calories before I take the next bite
guys we're definitely gonna have to hop
on one of these jeepneys in the next uh
couple days here get a feel for what
it's like to ride the local way
and this is a massive entrance for
Chinatown right there that leads to
I think the bridge that's going to get
us in the direction we need to go in
order to make it over there
rivers that leads right through the city
I would say for being right in the city
there's a little trash in there but not
as much as I've seen in a lot of other
cities uh so it's good to see that it's
not extremely polluted I mean it
definitely doesn't look like water that
I want to swim in but um
it looks uh
I mean you can only see a couple like
pieces of trash uh floating through
there at least from this angle
but yeah guys there's Bridges all along
this area there's a big arch one right
down that way
and a cool design to it all if you look
closely like on the bridge we've got
like lions right here on each one of the
uh poles so that is pretty awesome hello
all right we have made it to the other
side of the bridge and things are
already starting to look different I I
think we can safely say that we have
left Chinatown now and now we are
going to be heading up right through
here the roads are kind of confusing
because you've got like traffic Lanes
coming from Every Which Way fenced in
areas so some of these areas you can
tell it there's very uh limited spots on
where you can walk it looks like we
probably have to go through this park
where all of the uh
what is it called pool Policia
that's how police are set here who
Alicia well here we go we gotta try and
cross this here
so we got a nice little party going on
over here
all right we got a nice little Park area
right over here kind of a mix of tree
roots coming out of here with sand and
a lot of people uh hanging out
so they've got some like Street carts
and things
it seems like
what are they selling over here
foreign
[Music]
no thank you brother
all right we are almost to the park my
friends
and I think right up here is where we're
gonna go no that's not it department of
engineering right there
all right we gotta cross our first
street here in Manila
I don't know if they stopped the traffic
and stopped the pedestrians here so
we'll have to see when's the safe time
to cross
all right looks like this is going to be
our
our opportunity to go right here yeah
always follow the locals they're gonna
know the best ways to uh do it
hey how we doing
got some nice guys there
hello hello
very good
[Applause]
the nice guys up there
all right I think we're making uh good
progress here in terms of finding the
park
it's gonna be right up this way a lot of
nice pedestrian walkways over here and
places to kind of sit down hang out in
the park
this park uh just one block away is much
more like a jungle feel and the other
one was a lot of like sand and Roots
sticking out of the ground a lot of
trash receptacles so I guess it depends
on which Park you're in depends on how
nicely up kept it's gonna be
Manila
all right I think the cross the street
here we gotta go down and under
according to the GPS and according to
where all the locals seem to be gone
all right looks like we got people
playing in here Stairway to Santa Cruz
this looks like the way
we'll try this one out
hello
all right looks like we're the first
people uh coming out here to the day
okay we're making progress walking down
this way
we're getting the exercise in today
okay I think we are just about at the
park here
street food going on right there that is
going to be selling over here
look at this
this must be the entrance to the park
I'm dang Umaga
is exactly what I was thinking a
revolutionary Society founded by
anti-spanish Filipinos in Manila in 1892
and the primary aim was to gain
independence from Spain to Revolution
thanks to a fact on Google there so my
guess was it was a revolution I mean
obviously with a guy standing on the
very top with a sword along with various
different sculptures showing it looks
like areas of Oppression areas of War
areas of disagreement and I mean right
up there it looks like they have canes
hitting the children from above so like
you got a lot of different things being
represented there that's why the first
thing that came to mind was it had to do
with the uh the revolution so a very
very massive uh sculpture right here in
the middle of the city
sitting next to a massive festive tree
what do we got going on over here
brother

two hours
two thousand because tip here two
thousand no way Rodrigo what at the
beginning you said it was 250 per 30
minutes we better be at a special price
350 each for 30 minutes yeah yeah
because my brain is a discount your 100
100 yeah 250
250 per 30 minutes okay okay so do you

2000 you want to charge me forty dollars
okay you said uh per 30 minutes you said

that's one thousand for two hours 250.
30 minutes one hour
one one and a half hours
okay okay
Rodrigo I would have given you a tip if
you gave me the honest price
but I'll give you I owe you money for
the coconut
also
had you given me the right price I would
have given you uh two thousand because
um
not so good thank you brother I really
appreciate the time thank you thank you
thank you goodbye
oh yeah don't want to forget those thank
you Rodrigo uh you that's for you that's
for you brother that's yeah thank you
yeah that's definitely the common thing
here as you guys probably saw in uh all
of the different things that I purchased
today uh the uh right it did say on the
price menu 30 minutes for 350 and he
gave it to me for 250. but then he was
trying to charge me 1 000 per hour when
I got off so I was a bit upset because
Rodrigo is a good man and we had a lot
of fun together but we still had a lot
of fun and got him a couple meals too
and you know he made uh about 20 almost
20 US dollars out of that plus a couple
meals so hopefully that'll help him so
