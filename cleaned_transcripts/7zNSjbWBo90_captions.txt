- In this video, I'm
gonna show you how to make
one of my favorite Filipino
dishes, and that's lumpia.
(upbeat music)
What's good everyone,
if this is the first time we're meeting,
my name is Philip Lemoine,
and on this channel
I plan to post a ton of cooking videos.
Sharing some of my favorite
recipes like I am doing today.
If that sounds like
something you're in to,
consider subscribing right now.
So, growing up half
Filipino and half White,
I kind of got the best of both worlds.
My mom made amazing Filipino food,
and she also cooked all
of the American food
that my dad wanted to eat.
So I kind of grew up eating
a little bit of both.
One of my all-time favorite
dishes though, has always been
my mom's lumpia.
I love lumpia so much,
that I almost started
my own lumpia company.
I was gonna call it lumpia lab,
and I was basically gonna
bastardize lumpia by
filling it with all these crazy fillings
and put it in some sort of
beautique, hipster, pop-up shop.
One of my favorite lumpias
was a traditional one
that I was gonna call The Auntie Arlene.
And it's basically named after my mom,
and that's what we're
gonna make here today.
The Auntie Arlene lumpia is
a spin on my mom's recipe
and it's basically a
combination of pork, beef,
has some carrots, onions, and garlic,
and a few other things
are pretty much mix it up
and bind it all together.
In the description this video,
I have a full list of all the ingredients
I plan to use in this recipe.
So, I already prepped the
ingredients by weighing them out.
The next thing I'm gonna do is pretty much
throw it into a food
processor and blend it all up.
Also, please don't judge me,
but we are using all these
old Polka containers to
hold our ingredients.
I'm gonna do the carrots first,
and the way I kind of usually
do this is I'll do the carrots
and the garlic at the same time.
It's all gonna get mixed up anyways so,
pretty much I'm just
gonna throw it all in.
And pretty much, we're gonna
just grind it up till it's
really fine, small little pieces.
(blender whirring)
So, this right here is
about the consistency
that you're looking for,
for the shredded carrots
or minced carrots.
Just gonna transfer it
all into this container.
(upbeat music)
(blender whirring)
Oh!
So, in this bowl, I already
have two pounds of ground pork,
and two pounds of ground beef.
This ground beef is 80 20 blend,
I would highly recommend
going with the 80 20, because
if you go with something more lean,
I feel like the lumpia comes out dry, so
I think this is probably the
best mix for beef, and pork.
So, to that, add in the carrots.
(thumping)
And then we have our onions.
(thumping)
I'm also gonna put in the
soy sauce that I premeasured.
The soy sauce that I'm using is actually a
lower sodium soy sauce,
I'm using this brand here.
Make sure it's not like that
really dark, thick soy sauce,
use the soy sauce that you
would put, like, on top of rice
or something like that.
If you go with a dark soy sauce,
it's gonna be really salty.
I end up going with a
lower salt soy sauce,
and then I plan to season
afterwards with salt.
I personally like my food a little,
I don't want to say salty,
but I like it having flavor,
if you are sensitive to salt,
then maybe don't put any salt
and you can just stick with the soy sauce.
I have one tablespoon of ground pepper,
and then, I'm also gonna do
two eggs, which I need to grab.
(metal thud)
One.
(metal thud)
Two.
And then to that, I'm gonna
add, maybe, I'm gonna say
two, then I will go three
large pinches of salt.
I think the weird thing about lumpia is
you can't really taste
it until it's cooked,
so, I always say, "You can
always add more seasoning after,
but if you season it out too much before,
you're kind of stuck with it."
And then we pretty much
just mix it all up.
So usually right before I
start, even making the filling,
what I'll do is I'll go and
put the lumpia wrappers out
that way they'll defrost, and
usually around the time that
the filling is done, I can start
peeling the lumpia wrappers
which I'm gonna do next.
So, now that I've got this all mixed up,
I'm pretty much just gonna
throw it in the fridge,
and let it sit in there while I
peel all these lumpia wrappers.
The lumpia wrappers that my mom uses, and
the ones that they just so
happen to sell here in Hawaii
are this brand here.
I'll show you the
technique to peeling these.
Basically, what I do is, I
give 'em a good fold first
kind of flex them, get 'em going.
(plastic bag unraveling)
I personally like to just
go straight down the middle
or, whatever and just, peel 'em in half.
And then from there what
I'll do is go one at a time.
If you tear one, like this,
just try and be careful, and
finish it the rest of the way.
You could still use it,
you'll just roll it from the other side.
Just want to make sure
that their fully defrosted,
that way, they're not still
frozen, sticking together.
Now that the lumpia wrappers are peeled,
I'm pretty much gonna show
you how I wrap the lumpia.
I just cleaned this area by the way.
The way that I actually like to do it,
is, a more traditional way.
So, what you would do
is, you would lay it,
lay your lumpia wrapper
like a diamond, like this,
and then I have this one
fluid ounce ice cream scooper.
And pretty much, put this
right here, towards the middle.
And then, you just kind of
spread it out like this.
And then, this part here will fold over,
and then what I'll do is I
kinda roll it back like this,
a little bit.
This goes over here,
this side goes over here.
And then, this is what we,
my mom calls, the glue.
This is basically a egg, mixed
with a little bit of water.
And, you just pretty much
just put a little bit of glue.
And then just wrap it up.
And there it is, a lumpia.
So, I pretty much put
them all on a sheet pan,
and what I'm gonna do is just go through
and wrap as many as I can,
and fit them all into this sheet pan.
And then what I like to
do is par freeze them,
or I'll freeze them, all separately.
If you're to put them all into
like a bag or wrap in foil
before freezing them,
after they're frozen,
they're gonna be all stuck together.
So, it's better to par
freeze them separately,
and then that way, when
you put them in the bag
and want to just grab a few
out when you want to cook some,
they're not all stuck together.
Basically, gonna just roll
out as many as I can, and
I'll show you how I do it.
(upbeat music)
Once I pretty much finished a sheet,
I'm gonna throw this in
the freezer, and then
I'm gonna try and finish up
all the rest of this lumpia,
and then, freeze all that overnight,
and then tomorrow, what we'll do is
I'll show you how I package them,
and then also how I cook the lumpia.
So, stay tuned for that.
(freezer whirring)
(plastic bag rustling)
(freezer door thumps)
So, it's been a day
since we made the lumpia.
And because, we've par froze them,
so you should easily be able
to pull them apart like this.
Normally, after we freeze a lumpia,
what I usually do is just
package them up in like packs of 10
or whatever, and give them
out to my friends, or family.
For about the past two years,
we've been trying to
use a lot less plastic,
especially single-use plastic.
Unfortunately, a lot of the things
that we still enjoy eating,
come wrapped in plastic.
This is a good example, we
really like these pot stickers,
they just happen to come in this plastic.
Because we no longer use
plastic bags for our trash,
any plastic bag that we get our
hands on is like gold to us,
so, we'll hold on to it,
just in case we need to
throw anything away that's liquid or wet.
In this case, store
anything that we want to put
like, in the freezer.
You can also wrap them in
foil, I use the FoodSaver,
package them in to little
packets, so they will keep 'em
like, packed and no air, but
these are gonna go pretty quick
so, I'm not too worried
about them getting frostbite.
So, I'm gonna pack most
of these in here now,
and then I'll leave a few
out, and we'll cook some,
and I'll show you how I do that next.
(plastic bag rustling)
I'm gonna get super nerdy
technical on how I fry my lumpia,
but realistically, you
just need to deep fry
until it's golden brown.
I like using a saucepan
instead of a frying pan,
mainly because I don't
have to use as much oil
to do a deep fry with the lumpia.
I'll put the saucepan at
the stove at medium heat,
until it conduct to about 375 degrees.
I have this cool little
thermometer that I like to use,
basically, I'll put that to the oil,
and wait for it to come up to temperature.
Once the oil's at temperature, 375,
I'm gonna go ahead and drop
in a few pieces of the lumpia,
and that temperature is
gonna quickly drop back down.
I'll keep the stove at about six,
and then once it comes back up
to temperature around the 350,
I'll go ahead and drop that down to four,
about a low medium heat.
The reason being, is because
the temperature of the oil's
gonna continue to rise if I don't,
and when I go to cook
the next batch of lumpia,
that oil's gonna be at about 450 degrees,
and then those will burn, or
those will cook a lot quicker,
and the insides won't be fully cooked.
So we're just go ahead and
cook the lumpia till it's
to a nice golden brown,
and just flip them over,
you should only have to
flip them once or twice.
If your pan is really shallow,
or you don't have a lot
oil where it can float,
you'll get a little bit of browning,
or dark browning on the lumpia,
because it's touching
the bottom of the pan.
Just deep fry it until it's golden brown.
You can use this
thermometer that I have too,
to check the inside of the lumpia,
to see what the internal temperature is.
I think pork is around 145
where it's considered safe to eat.
If your lumpia is at around 130 already,
you can go ahead and pull them out.
It's gonna carry over to the
140s, even 150s real quick.
So, once you check it,
as long as it pass 120,
I'm pretty sure it's safe
to eat, and like I said,
once you take them out of the fryer,
they're still gonna continue to cook.
So, just leave 'em, let 'em rest,
and I'm sure that'll carry over in to,
well overpassed what is
considered safe to eat.
One thing you want to
make sure not to do is
overcrowd the pot with too much lumpia.
It's not gonna cook evenly,
or it's really gonna drop the temperature.
You also want to make sure
the oil is at temperature
when you put them in, because if it's not
the lumpia will basically
start unraveling,
so when you drop it in there,
you want it to pretty much
crisp up real quick,
but not get golden brown too fast either.
Once the lumpia is done,
pretty much you just wanna
put 'em on a plate, I
usually put 'em on a rack,
fresh out of the oil, that way they don't
soak up a lot of their oil and get soggy.
I have this sweet and
sour sauce that we use
for all of our lumpia,
this is my favorite.
This is what my mom uses,
so this is what I use.
I'm just gonna put a
little bit of this into a
'nother little bowl.
My mom always says, "You
don't need to put a lot
you can always add more,
but you can't put it back in
the jar after you poured it."
And there it is guys, the
spin on my mother's recipe
The Auntie Arlene, my favorite lumpia.
I think in the future, I'll
post up a few other videos
of some other lumpia
creations that I've made.
I know one of my favorites that was
really popular with a
lot of my friends was our
chicken pot pie lumpia,
we also have a macaroni and cheese lumpia
with a tomato bisque dip.
You really could just
put anything into lumpia,
and fry it up, and it's
probably gonna come out great.

please be sure to subscribe to my channel.
I plan on making a ton
more videos just like it.
Thanks again so much for watching, guys.
