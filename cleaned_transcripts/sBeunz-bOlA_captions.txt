- So I'm in the Philippines right now
and I'm gonna try Jollibee.
I have no idea what it is.
(light-hearted music)
Alright, so a few people have told me,
you might be watching this right now,
This is out to you
directly, to try Jollibee
next time I'm in the Philippines.
Well I'm in the Philippines right now,
and I'm gonna try Jollibee.
I have no idea what it is.
So I'm gonna suss it out.
Drive-through though
gives me a little bit of
an impression that it's a
little bit fast-food kind of.
Let's go and check it out.
I'm doing this for you guys.
Let's check out Jolli's.
Let's check out Jolli's.
(lighthearted music)
This is like McDonald's.
I don't know if I can eat
this, not part of my...
I'll do it for a few people have suggested
that I try Jolli's.
It's my first time getting Jollibee's,
my first time.
And the guy over there said
I should go with the chicken,
I should try the chicken.
- [Cashier] Ah, yes.
- So, which one do you recommend?
Because there's like chicken...
- [Cashier] We have chicken with, um
- [Brad] Macaroni.
- [Cashier] And then we also
have chicken with spaghetti.
- With spaghetti, what do you recommend?
This is my first time.
- Your first time I
would recommend you get
the chicken with spaghetti.
- Chicken with spaghetti?
- [Cashier] Yes, it's
better than the fried rice,
getting the spaghetti here.
(light-hearted music)
- Alright, doing it for
the vlog, as they say,
doing it for the vlog.
Basically we're talking
like, fast-food chicken
with fast-food Italian on the same plate.
(background chatter)
It's quite nice!
It's actually quite nice.
I'm also quite starving as well.
Just real quick, I'm just getting through
the spaghetti right now.
The spaghetti tastes like,
for the guys back home in
Australia watching this,
I'm not sure if you
have this in the States,
but SPC Spaghetti out of a can,
which I grew up and used to eat
spaghetti and baked beans
out of a can by SPC.
And I really quite liked it.
It actually has very, very
similar flavour to that,
SPC Spaghetti.
It's actually quite nice.
The spaghetti is quite, I
haven't tried the chicken,
but the chicken looks
like it's from like KFC.
(background chatter)
I don't like it.
I don't like the chicken.
No, don't like the chicken.
Don't like it.
Alright my friends, just
had my first Jolli's,
first Jollibee.
And the aftertaste is actually,
I don't like the
aftertaste of the chicken.
It was pretty brutal actually.
All I got is this oily sensation
in the back of my throat.
So I actually don't
like the chicken at all
but the spaghetti was really nice.
Seems like everybody,
they buy the chicken with
the spaghetti combined,
and that's how you eat it.
That's what they told me anyway.
So next time, I'll go
back for the spaghetti,
no chicken.
Only because I don't
usually do deep fried food.
I'm off, I'm off.
I'm gonna sign off
and that's it.
Hope you enjoyed.
See you guys.
