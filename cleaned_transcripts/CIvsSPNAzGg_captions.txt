Guys recently I was asked by a local if I wanted to come along on a private boat to a private island with shipwrecks
with puppies with mermaids
It's a yes from me.
Just taken a one-hour boat ride to the shipwreck and it's right here right behind me the water is so clear
There is absolutely nobody here just us and the shipwreck
- Let's go.
Poppy: That was very awkward. (laughs)
- I was waiting for you to say something witty.
Poppy: I didn't know what you wanted me to say, so.     This got awkward.
We find ourselves in... paradise.
This island where I am now is called Pass Island. It is extremely small and extremely beautiful.
Something cool is that the regular tours don't come here, so you have to get a private boat in order to come to this island.
So it's not as busy as other islands might be.
Okay guys, we are leaving paradise behind, so say goodbye.
We have gotten to a second shipwreck, and the water is even clearer here!
The second shipwreck was so incredible. I think it was a bigger ship originally, but it was cut in half.
It was amazing. It was a little bit closer to the surface, so you could almost swim inside it.
It was just amazing and so many fish!
It was just an incredible experience.
I loved exploring ruins and stuff like that and exploring the ruins of a shipwreck is just amazing.
So the reason that there are so many shipwrecks in this area is because the Japanese had colonized the Philippines during World War II
And they had a ton of ships in the area. There are dozens and dozens of shipwrecks here of Japanese warships.
So guys, this is MJ, and Chi. And this is who we've been on the boat with today.
And they are so inspiring! They quit their jobs and now Chi
You're a mermaid instructor, right?
Chi: Yes.
And you're a free dive instructor
MJ: Yeah. Pregnant one. (laughs)
I am sure that tomorrow, we will be going to some more gorgeous places. 
Poppy: I sure hope so.
So look out for that.
