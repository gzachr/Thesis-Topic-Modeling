Philippines versus Thailand who does
drag better Philippines they beat their
bit Miss Universe we beat them at
everything just saying I'm joking
of course
well I haven't been to Thailand as well
but I know for a fact that Philippines
is way better wow but I would say they
have a lot of like good supplies there
yeah they have the good supplies
hey guys what's up it's jiggly Caliente
with the cast of drag race Philippines
and we are doing double takes here each
one of us are going to take a question
we're going to answer and give you our
honest real opinion true
it's not really respectable in some way
but now that I'm doing it it should be
respectful it's a profession because
it's a 12 to 13 hour job before drag
race Philippines we were just confined
there are only two major bars like
nectar and obar there are now a lot of
avenues and platforms I was so surprised
they're essential and can't imagine and
this last weekend put food in the table
then that's suck fresh you should not
call me by my government name if I am in
drag it took us a lot of hour tourists
in preparation to look this good come on
with this hair you call me Arthur
no one should call Queens by their
government name when they're in drag
especially if they're trans
for me it doesn't really matter because
it might be really his friends do
seasons that do not feature RuPaul get
less tension from fans based on
experience no you want and drag race for
the girls not bro yes I was telling
jiggly that Queens from Down Under they
told me that they love our season
because our franchise is just
exponentially better Eva has a video of
Sasha Kobe thinking pop off out there
that was kind of cool and Alaska is a
huge Marina fan I was so surprised when
I was in the UK like a lot of people
knowing when they're in the UK she said
makes me a smaller business and calls me
Corazon I will say oh my god do you know
how best investing everything so
drug in the Philippines is comparable to
animals in the zoo what oh
oh
yeah Corazon yeah
well maybe during drag con with our own
Google yeah like yeah in the zoo
technically I mean it depends on who
you're talking to
mm-hmm well definitely we can all answer
the turtle
yeah you heard it right slowly but
surely they're becoming more mainstream
the more people see that there's money
to be made they're gonna take this girl
seriously after drag race we're not in
corporate events or even expressed to
put track on their uh organizations me
precious and Morgana we are Ambassador
for unisa for the vaccines
are back and you're in the TV show yeah
okay here's her question candidate
number two
the lgbtq plus communities only sees as
the comedic Philip or the sidekick that
notion is long gone Vice Ganda has
proven that she's not just a sidekick
she is the box office Queen of the
Philippines I wish though they would
give more serious roles to the LGBT
community
it's a show in the Philippines and they
hired us drag queen means to be like a
sidekick and I told him like moving
forward they should stop doing the gay
guys the best friend of the lead because
we're more than that we have our own
characters we have our own stories
especially when Caledon won best
fighting actress yeah last Metro Manila
film festivals together with silhouette
I feel like that could be on the horizon
for the Filipino actors as well
Philippine drug artists have to overcome
more obstacles than drag artists in
other countries as a drug artist in the
Philippines it's definitely hard I think
I can attest to that for you girls I
feel like it is a little bit harder in
the Philippines for drag artists just
like the resources are very limited
certain things are just easier to grab
here in the Western World I'm wearing an
American dress I'm wearing a five shoes
so yeah it's really hard yes
foreign
