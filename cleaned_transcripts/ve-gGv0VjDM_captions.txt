yeah so I found out that there's a German 
restaurant here in BGC Manila and yeah I've  
been living abroad for over three years now and 
sometimes I just miss my home country's food I  
think all of you can relate to this feeling 
that sometimes you're just craving your home  
country's food any other past weeks you saw 
me trying a lot of Filipino food a lot of  
local food today I will show you some German 
food and I'm having my friend Joseph with  
me today hey he's from China but you've been 
living in the Philippines for how long already
so I will show him some German food as 
well and yeah if you have been watching  
my videos already last year in Thailand 
you maybe recognized him yeah we know  
each other because we study together in 
Bangkok in 2019 and now we are neighbors  
here in the Philippines so let's get a taxi 
and let's head over to the German restaurant
hi we're going to uh Fifth Avenue BBC 
High Street High Street yes 100 100 200.
it's like a three minute ride and he wants 200 
pesos yeah it's definitely less than 100 meters  
why does it want 200 for five 
minutes away it's raining  
yeah okay we find another taxi 
gun oh what's going on over there  
did you see that before Oh I did it what's that 
Street Market that's new it's great for both  
yeah we're in front of the Venice Mall which 
I showed in one of the previous videos already
guys meet up yeah okay
okay we have a meter Taxi yes hello
there is a very rainy rainy day here it's 
been raining for several hours now already  
actually is the first day since it's raining a lot
all right and the price with the media 
taxi now was only 89 pesos so less  
than half of what the other guy wanted to 
have the fixed price that's crazy Okay so
oh we can cross the street here
oh what's going on here do you know 
what's going on here in the weekend  
yeah like there's a sign that the revenue is 
closed everyone rides yeah remember when I was  
here a few weeks ago there was also something 
going on here maybe a concert or something  
Reach for the Stars there's a popular boy band 
here looks like like Korean to me yeah okay
I like that it looks like a like 3D 
huge cat here it's nice advertisements
there are some cool looking bars here oh wow
all right here it is outside 
German beer bar and restaurant
let's have a look we need a place without 
music see if we have music in here  
oh they have bigger vehicle let's take one
so I think it's better if we sit outside 
yeah because we have music in here
so far it doesn't look that 
German to me we usually don't  
have tables like this in a German restaurant
I guess it will be like a Filipino cup 
to it away from the music because I  
can't post videos on YouTube when there's 
copyrighted music in the background so I  
always have to avoid copyrighted 
music and restaurants or markets
oh yeah the area here is very nice  
yeah this is the BTC High Street yes oh I'm 
actually very excited now yeah it's like this  
is a really propagary restaurant for the name you 
know what it means both sides roadside watch means  
bread bread and height means thyme so basically 
translates to uh it's time for bread bread
here is the German word for beer same yeah you 
tried German food before yeah only once the one  
time we tried it together Bangkok yeah oh yeah we 
actually talked about that earlier yeah we went  
to a German restaurant in Bangkok yeah because 
it was the birthday of another friend yeah okay  
but it's like three years ago three years ago okay 
and we can also try German beer here I guess yeah
I would hands

by him Stefan that's a beer
brands we have lion Chef on 
original hell it's a type of beer  
I don't have which in here oh you said 
you like to eat crowd right yes I love  
it I think you should try the sauerkraut 
origin it's like a German pastry yeah with  
a scratch and on the first side by the 
way first we have the different names
oh yeah but I think what we are going to 
do is we will eat the Asian ready right  
yeah yeah so we order different types of 
t-shirts and then we can share everything  
yeah like something that usually don't 
do in Germany yeah in a German restaurant  
everyone eats or others one dish stuff 
you can do it you don't share your value
oh yeah it's this one actually looks good 
I want to eat this this is with crowd as  
well right oh yeah we really like trout

from Japanese okay uh we would 
like to get the Jager schnitzel

Ryan Stefania two small ones 43 yes yes

the sausage this one right and this one
muenberg sausage
very excited because I said with mashed potatoes 
and crowd right oh yes yeah okay okay perfect  
okay thank you thank you thank you sir you know 
how to say thank you for sure it's the easy word  
thank you sir thank you very much in German all 
right and while we are waiting for the food let me  
quickly tell you about today's video sponsor which 
is once again surfshark VPN and if you don't know  
what's a VPN it stands for virtual private Network 
and it lets you virtually change the location of  
your phone or your laptop to basically anywhere 
in the world and that can be extremely helpful I  
am using a VPN service almost every single day 
for basically two reasons and the first reason  
is for security when you are connected to a VPN 
it can encrypt the data that is sent between your  
phone or your laptop and the internet and so your 
personal data and information become more safe so  
I always feel way more secure about my personal 
information when I'm connected to a VPN and the  
second reason why I'm using a VPN almost every 
single day is to unblock geo-restricted content  
some of the content on YouTube for example 
or on Netflix is only available in certain  
countries so you can't access it when you're 
in another country for example watching German  
Bundesliga football highlights is only possible 
for me when I am in Germany so I can't watch it  
when I'm in the Philippines so I just switch my 
location back to Germany and then I can watch  
it and yeah the VPN service that I am using is 
surfshark VPN and I can highly recommend it it  
is the only VPN to offer one account for unlimited 
devices and if you would like to check it out as  
well you can click the link in my description 
on the pin comment and if you enter the promo  
code can you can get 85 off plus three extra 
months for free that is a great deal and they  
also have a 30 day money back guarantee so you 
can test it out without any risk click the link  
down below thanks to surfshark for sponsoring 
this video and now let's wait for the food and  
has just arrived she has to yes German 
beer first as we say in Germany yeah
actually I don't really know this brand 
why and Stefan I know it's really good  
it's a popular uh brand but I don't really know it
yeah I like it as well you know in Germany 
we have thousands of beer brands yeah even  
in a village like basically every town 
in Germany has their own popular beer  
brands yeah so every region in Germany 
has their own breweries that's really  
good and then we have like some brands 
that are like popular all over Germany  
so you like it delicious actually they serve it in 
a glass from paulana which is another big Famous  
Brand one of the most popular brands it's from 
the valley what's this it's a it's a brand name  
as well no this is the name of the beer it's ice 
beer which basically means right beer because we  
also have the the dark beer don't kill beer and 
this is the the dried it's right here that doesn't  
sound right but uh and hell is here in German so 
right here's the right beer translated literally
maybe you want to order the one liter one or the 
empty mask hook the one liter put it with the arm  
pretty different from Auntie Annie yeah you tried 
to Auntie end pressure before me but that's the  
American fashion the onten is like a like a chain 
for different price this one is the authentic one  
yeah this is um usually the predators in Germany 
are bigger but it looks quite authentic here  
so we can actually try this first 
so we just use our hand or we have  
to cut it yeah we can just split 
it in half by with the hands right  
you don't mind if I touch it right oh 
it's so warm it's actually better than
so you can have a half thank you 
and then there's the water oh I  
don't really do it but if you want 
to try it let me just try the taste
um different than auntie Annie very 
different I like the salt the salt on  
the top usually there's a lot of salt 
yeah it's more like almond or cream
I would say it tastes quite authentic 
especially it's still a warm now almost  
hot it's really nice so they're freshly made 
it it's my first time to try the authentic one  
it's really good actually let 
me um I will put some butter
so you can spread the butter a little bit of this
[Music]
so you put the butter on top here
now the butter is melting I love it yeah
even better with the butter come on so 
definitely better than the Auntie anywhere
sausages
muenberg is a town in Germany and the Sausages 
are from that town wow how big is this is
amazing oh thank you so much wow 
check out it's so good so we have  
schnitzel here which is a breaded 
pork you can also get it with chicken  
and then yeah yeah lemon on the side the 
sauce smells really good this usually  
should be cranberry sauce not sure and 
then we have a mushroom sauce so this is  
called a gigash schnitzel which means a hunter's 
schnitzel eager translates to Hunter the hunter  
um this is very popular with the mushroom sauce 
smells so good man and then the potatoes on the  
side super excited then we have the newenberger 
bratwurst and those are sauces for the sausage  
yeah this is a should be custard two different 
types of custard and then this one I'm not sure  
maybe a sweet chili sauce yeah but that wouldn't 
be uh served in Germany made it like uh yeah yeah  
and then we have trout here and mashed potatoes 
really good oh okay oh okay so that's either the  
Asian way like we have our plate so we can share 
everything yeah let's see again it's really good I  
can I can tell it's a real sausage it's real meat 
inside yeah because after years in Southeast Asia  
the sausage I eat these smelly fish sausage 
yeah yeah and there's no meat inside this one  
that should be like proper proper pork meat yeah 
yeah definitely definitely and with the crowd  
honey thing is in Germany I never liked these 
type of sausages I never ate them in Germany  
but I know it's so good I will try 
the sausage now the crowd is so good  
also the crowd I exactly like you know we have a 
fermented cabbage in my hometown in northeastern  
China yeah it's exactly the same as this one 
so this one just reminds me of my own job  
that's crazy that's great I bring a Chinese 
guy to a German restaurant as my hometown food  
wow I never expected that it's so good 
okay all right let me cut the sausage
so this type of sausage is very popular 
when you do barbecue like it's one of the  
cheapest type of sausages so it's very 
popular to like if you have many guests  
of your whole mood and you can just buy 
many of these sausages it's really good
tomorrow
from a German point of view it's a good good 
one okay like I said I never really eat this  
the sausages in Germany because I'm not 
a huge fan of them but as far as I can  
judge I think it's quite authentic to me it's 
very good but you need to dip it in the musket
um
actually we are missing like another 
spoon to uh serve the food right oh yeah
is it good
yeah it doesn't taste so strong
taste if that makes sense 
[Music] together with the sausage
hey hi thank you very much
so I want to try the mashed potatoes [Music] by 
the way let me know in the comment section if  
you have ever tried German food and if you 
did what was your favorite food and if you  
have never tried German food let me know if 
you would like to try something I recommend  
and you haven't even tried the Schnitzel 
yet oh yeah it's so amazing mashed potatoes
because it's not not ready probably it's 
more like a like instant smashed potatoes  
let me try it's not really made fresh from 
real potatoes I think to me it's just same  
as smashed potato in McDonald's or yeah 
but I don't think that this is fresh fish  
made like they didn't like usually you 
make you cut the potatoes you stamp the  
potatoes and then you add some spices but 
I don't think they're just watery I think
different from the others let's see 
if the potatoes are better you also  
eat potatoes in your hometown right yeah 
we eat a lot yeah because the my hometown  
is quite cold so yeah the thing we grow on 
the field is like mainly corns and potatoes  
when he first told me about that he eats potatoes 
in his hometown in China I was really surprised  
to hear that yeah salt in China they eat more 
like rice and those kind of thing where in my  
hometown we eat more noodles and potatoes yeah 
the potatoes are really good by the way yeah  
they have some I don't really know what spices 
they put around it but it's really good yeah I'm  
very excited to try the Schnitzel now usually 
one of my favorite dishes in Germany schnitzel
[Music]
okay so it's just breaded pork
oh wow this is really good okay 
you need to give it a try too
oh it's really tender inside crispy 
outside I like it actually very similar  
you know when you order Japanese 
food the katsudon for example oh  
yeah you get breaded wheat on top as well 
yeah and it's very similar actually yeah
you like a lemon right no yeah like so 
usually you squeeze the lemon over I love it
and then I'm not sure what this is now
maybe that raspberry sauce 
usually it should be cranberry
okay so you tried every dish now yeah which 
one is your favorite oh probably the sausage  
it's about in a sausage okay okay I also 
love this one I mean they're all good it's  
very difficult to say which one is the best yeah 
my favorite because I'm not a big fan of these  
sausages definitely the shots on here oh okay 
let's see if we can actually finish our office
all right and we were able to finish 
everything actually he ate most of it  
because I was full already let's see 
what's the total drill it's a 1775.
so definitely more expensive 
than the average Filipino meal  
of course you always pay extra foreign
oh that's 30 Euros or like 30 US dollar s 
deeper than what you get in here in Germany  
you will pay definitely a little bit more 
for this story probably around 50 Euros so  
like almost almost double the price but I think 
that's actually quite okay for German food in the  
Philippines yeah I was expecting it to be uh more 
expensive especially with the beer and that's okay  
and yeah actually our plan was to also go to 
Chinatown today so I show them German food and  
then we go to Chinatown and have some Chinese we 
have some Chinese food but it was really raining  
so much so we will do that another day and it 
will be in one of the next videos then and yeah  
if you haven't seen the previous video that 
I filmed in this area then you can check it  
out right here stay healthy stay positive 
and then see on the next episode ciao guys
