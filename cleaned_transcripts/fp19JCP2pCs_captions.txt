- Hi, I'm Beryl, and in today's episode,
we're doing another "Trying
Foods That I Don't Like."
I'm somebody who, if you've noticed,
tends to like pretty much everything.
I need to get in there with my hands.
Yes.
Oh, dang.
Yeah.
Yes.
But there are a few
foods that I don't like,
and I've asked you guys
to help change my mind.
We've done this with liver.
Yo, wait, wait a minute.
We've done this with cantaloupe.
And now, we're doing it with bitter gourd.
In general, I would say
that the world is divided
into two types of people,
those who also don't like bitter gourd,
and those who just don't know
what it is yet. (laughing)
So let's start with this.
This is bitter gourd.
It is a gourd that grows on a vine.
It's found in the Caribbean,
in Asia, and in Africa.
It is bitter, thus the name bitter gourd.
This plant has a couple of names.
You'll hear it called bitter
gourd, karela, bitter melon.
It's always the same thing.
This kind of slightly spiny, viney plant
that doesn't taste good. (snickering)
The first time I had
it, it was in a juice,
and I think a lot of people
might have the same experience as me.
It is ugh.
It is so intense.
But the thing is is that
this gourd has tons and tons
of health benefits,
which is why so many moms
push it on their kids,
and try to get them to
eat it all the time.
But I still don't like it.
The artist today is Alexandra Sherman.
My dad actually loves her
art and sent it to me,
and here she is.
She says that she's inspired by nature,
and a lot of her work uses
watercolors and collages.
I'm leaving a link to
where you can follow her
and check out more of her work.
Okay.
Ugh.
Bitter gourd.
(gentle music)
- Hello everyone, I am Morweni,
and I live in Colombo, Sri Lanka.
The dish I'm bringing to you today
is what made me like to have bitter gourd,
and it is the fried bitter gourd salad.
So in Sri Lankan food culture,
bitter gourd is treated as a gourd,
despite of its bitter and
not so appealing taste,
because of its medicinal properties.
It's a rich source of antioxidants
and fights against inflammation,
and it also helps to manage diabetes.
So almost all Sri Lankan
moms, including mine,
tries to sneak in and
incorporate bitter gourd
into their children's meal,
because we all hate the
bitter taste and we refuse it.
Usually, Sri Lankan
cuisines are based on rice,
so this salad is consumed as
a side with other curries,
such as duck curry, chicken
curry, and et cetera.
This dish is not a unique family recipe,
but I guess it is one
of the most common ways
of making bitter gourd here in Sri Lanka.
My mother used to make
this dish all the time,
because that is the only way
I like to have bitter gourd,
and she really needs those
nutrients included in my diet.
I think what makes this
dish different and unique
from other bitter gourd dishes
is the combination of
flavors in the ingredients,
such as the tanginess of
lime, the acidity of tomatoes,
the fishy taste of Maldive
fish, and also the saltiness.
I think it really helps to balance out
and hide the bitter taste
of the bitter gourd.
So, Beryl, I hope you
enjoy and love this dish.
Thank you.
(quirky music)
- Okay, Sri Lankan fried
bitter gourd salad.
When in doubt, deep fry.
I agree with that sentiment.
(Beryl chewing)
Well, I just ate a huge
green chili, so there's that.
Oh my goodness.
Let's do another bite.
I don't see any green chilies.
(quirky music)
Actually, this isn't bad.
There's a lot of other
flavors going on in here,
and I don't feel like it's that bitter.
I mean, I do feel like,
you deep fry anything,
and all the flavor just becomes good.
I'm like, on the lookout
for green chilies right now.
Yeah, I like this.
I could eat this easily.
I am eating it easily.
This reminds me of some
other kind of similar chows
that I've done.
Even the Y Y chow that I did,
you just replaced the Y Y
noodles with bitter gourd.
I mean, it's probably a lot healthier,
although with it being
deep fried, I don't know.
I think that like,
you still get like, a little
bit of that bitterness,
but nothing that I think is
troublesome, like at all.
Visually, these little rings
are pretty cool looking.
(Beryl chewing)
Yeah, it's not bitter.
You know, soaking it in the salt water
with the turmeric might've helped.
There are a lot of ways that people have
to get the bitterness out.
I feel kind of bad.
Like, the very first dish I
try, I'm like, "Yup, it's good."
(Beryl laughs)
You know what? That's okay.
Don't worry, guys.
There's still time for me to
not like something. (chuckling)
Okay, let's do the next dish.
(calm music)
- Hi, I'm Michelle. I'm from Malaysia.
Even though you said you
don't like bitter gourd,
I just think that you haven't
found a dish that uses it
in a way that you like.
Yong Tau Foo, or (speaking
foreign language)
literally means stuffed tofu in Chinese,
but it's actually a variety of vegetables
stuffed with fish paste.
Yong Tau Foo is quite a common dish
in Malaysia and Singapore.
It originated from the
Hakka people in China.
And as we immigrated from China,
we brought it over to
Malaysia and Singapore.
The main attraction of the fish paste,
is the bouncy texture.
And then it's savory and
tastes like fish, of course.
And then it's complimented
by the ingredients
that you stuff it into.
So there's a bitter gourd
that is a bit al dente,
and the bitterness
complements the saltiness.
And then there is tofu puffs,
which soak up the soup that you use,
and there's a soft, creamy eggplants,
there's some spicy chili.
You've all this variety
of texture and tastes
that make this dish delicious.
The bitter gourd provides nice contrast
to all the flavors in this dish.
But I do admit that a lot of
people don't like bitter gourd,
and it's more of an acquired taste.
My family do make it at home
and we all gather together
to help to stuff the fish
cake into the vegetables.
And it's quite common to find it
in health food centers or restaurants,
but of course the homemade
version is much better.
I do like bitter gourd,
I think it's a very unique ingredient,
and it provides a nice contrast
in whatever dish that it's in,
and it has quite a refreshing
taste in my opinion.
But I do admit that it's
quite an acquired taste
and not many people love it.
But it's not a dish, an ingredient
that you eat on its own,
and you always pair with something,
and it's combination that makes it work.
(quirky music)
- Okay. So this is the
Yong Tau Foo from Malaysia.
I cannot believe that I've
made my own fish paste.
Does this look like fish paste?
Talk about going way outside
my comfort zone, but I did it.
I think I did a pretty good
job. I mean, I don't know.
I don't even know if this working.
This is a big piece of bitter gourd.
(Beryl chewing)
Ugh.
(Beryl laughs)
It's too bitter!
It's too bitter.
(Beryl laughs)
The flavor, okay, let me, I'm gonna have,
I did eggplant.
(Beryl chewing)
That's good.
Ooh. My fish paste tastes good!
Okay, that is delicious.
The bitter gourd is not.
I don't like it in this.
(Beryl sighs)
Should I try again for good measure?
Ugh, mm-mm!
(Beryl chewing)
I don't think it balances.
Ugh.
I like, feel it in the back of my throat.
My whole mouth tastes...
(smacking lips)
All right, let's do the tofu.
Mm!
Num!
Everything else in this dish is amazing,
just not the bitter gourd.
The flavors of this are
really, really nice.
The fish paste is not
overwhelmingly fishy.
It actually, you can kind
of taste the white pepper
that I put in there, which is really nice.
I feel like it is like, a
very well balanced dish.
The eggplant with the
fish paste is really good.
The tofu with the fish
paste is really good.
I would say that this dish is delicious.
The bitter gourd, wah.
(Beryl snickers)
(soft string music)
- Hi, my name is Sadie Marie,
and I'm from Rotterdam, the Netherlands,
but my family is originally from Suriname,
where today's dish will be from.
The dish that I would like
to share with you today
is called Gevulde Sepropo,
which translates to stuffed bitter melon.
It's a bitter melon
stuffed with mince meat
in a tomato sauce.
Suriname is a Caribbean country
on the north coast of South America,
and we have a very
diverse population there,
which is reflected in
our beautiful cuisine.
We have Afro and Indigenous influences,
as well as influences from
India, China, and Indonesia.
So they all come together
on this small part of South America,
and created this beautiful
culture and cuisine.
In Surinamese culture, the
use of bitter vegetables
aren't actually that uncommon.
We use them in our foods to eat,
but we also drink them as juices or teas,
as they are packed with nutrients
and have great health benefits.
I remember when I was younger
and my mom would make me drink a sip,
just to stay healthy, and
it was the worst thing ever.
Before you start cooking, you
need to prep the bitter melon
by cutting it into three
to four inch pieces,
hollowing it out, and leaving
it to rest in some salt water.
Then, you boil them and add
some sugar to the water,
all of this to offset as much
of its bitterness as possible.
Then you take them out and you stuff them
with the seasoned mince
meat, you fry it up,
and you put it in the tomato sauce.
That's all you need,
and then you serve it
next to some white rice,
and you enjoy it.
The flavor of this dish is
actually still quite bitter.
So I'm not sure if you'll
like it on the first try,
but it's something that has
to grow on you as you go.
As a kid, I definitely didn't like it.
Like, no matter if my mom, my
aunt, or my grandma made it,
bitterness just wasn't for me.
But now that I'm older and
I've tried it more and more,
I'm starting to appreciate it,
as the saltiness of the meat
really nicely compliments the bitterness,
as well as the spice with the sauce.
It just all comes together
in this beautiful dish.
I hope that you enjoy
cooking and eating this dish.
And I hope that you will
open up your kitchen
to even more of the
beautiful Surinamese recipes
that we have to offer,
because this is just one out
of many, many, many, right?
(gentle music)
- Okay. Stuffed bitter
gourd from Suriname.
And I have to admit that I
actually didn't originally know
where Suriname was in South America.
So I'm gonna show all of you guys,
in case you also didn't know.
It's located here, next to Guyana.
This is a big, beautiful world,
and I'm the first to admit
that my geography is
definitely not up to par.
So I am learning a lot.
So thank you guys so much
for allowing me the space to learn.
Back to bitter gourd.
It smells amazing, and
I've tasted this sauce.
It is so delicious.
Like, it's a little bit
spicy, a little bit sweet.
Honestly, it's like a great red sauce.
I'm just a little bit apprehensive,
because we have another huge, big,
thick piece of bitter gourd to eat.
(Beryl chewing)
It has the bitter taste,
but the meat is really good.
Okay.
(Beryl chewing)
I like it. Oh my gosh.
I'm so excited. (laughing)
I like this.
(Beryl chewing)
Honestly, this is, I love it.
If you can't find bitter gourd,
but want to try this, use a
zucchini, stuff a zucchini,
it'll probably give you something similar.
The flavor of the bitter gourd
in this is really subtle.
Like it's there, but it's not offensive.
Sadie Marie, all right.
I literally ate everything.
This is why you need to just
be open to trying foods,
because literally, you never know.
(cheerful guitar music)
- Hi everyone, my name is Joanne,
and I live in Philadelphia
in the United States.
For today's dish,
we're gonna talk about
Kalonji from Guyana.
So my parents are from Guyana,
it's a small, like, South American country
that's right above Brazil,
but then it's in between
Venezuela and Suriname.
And this dish, I like to
think it's another excuse
and just another way to eat curry,
because the main ingredients of the dish
are what we call karela,
which is the bitter melon,
shrimp, and then it's
basically all mixed in,
like, you curry the shrimp
and then you also make karela
curry almost in coconut milk.
So I just think it's
another way to eat curry,
which I absolutely love.
In Guyana, there's a lot
of cultures that combine.
There's influence from
China, Africa, India,
the Portuguese, the British,
and also the native people
that live in Guyana.
One of the cool things about
Guyana is that every culture
and every ethnic group
partakes in everyone's culture.
So I don't know if this
dish is necessarily like,
a combination, or if it's
something that's specific.
But I would say that karela
is a very popular ingredient
that everybody would eat.
Kalonji is a dish that
I've only had maybe like,
once or twice in my life.
It's not something that
we in my, you know,
immediate family get to eat super often,
because when you're living
in the United States,
or anywhere that's not your
like, home, for my parents,
it's hard to get ingredients that taste
or are exactly the same as
what they would get in Guyana.
So this isn't something
that I've eaten a whole lot,
but I like it.
For me, it just tastes so good.
Even if you don't like karela,
you like kalonji, because it's curry.
(gentle piano music)
- Okay, so normally I
cook these in one day.
This, however, took two days,
because in the video that I
watched about how to make this,
when the person put the coconut
in, there was a lot of milk.
My coconut did not have that much milk.
So I had to go out and get coconut milk,
which probably wouldn't
have been a big deal,
but then, like, I broke the routine,
and all of a sudden I was like,
"Ugh, I don't want to cook anymore."
So, long story short...
Well, it was just to say that
I needed to buy coconut milk.
Anyway, here we go.
(Beryl chewing)
The bitter gourd is very bitter
still for me in this dish.
Okay, wait, let's just get
the shrimp filling out here.
'Cause this...
Yum.
That shrimp filling is so good.
It's like, you know, I'm
surprised that the bitter gourd
is bitter still, because
it got cooked a lot.
(Beryl chewing)
Ooh.
I would like this with zucchini.
You're getting obviously,
like, a lot of coconut flavor.
The problem is just that like,
the bitter gourd in this,
for some reason is still
just very bitter, you know?
Bitter gourd, why you
gotta be so difficult?
(Beryl chewing)
I'm really learning that stuffing gourds
is probably something I
should be doing more of,
because I like it.
I mean, not the bitter gourd,
but I like the stuffing part of it.
Okay.
Onwards and upwards.
(rhythmic string music)
- Hello there, (speaking
in foreign language),
my name is Zoor.
I live in Perth, Western Australia,
but I was born in Laoag City, Philippines.
If you're not a fan of the
vegetable bitter melon,
then maybe us Filipino
can help you with that,
with this humble, yet tasty ampalaya dish,
Ginisang ampalaya, or
stir-fried bitter melon,
is a popular vegetable
dish in my home country.
I always say to some of
my non Filipino friends,
whenever they're trying bitter
melon for the first time,
that once you overcome the
bitter taste of the bitter melon,
then you'll be okay with any
bitter obstacles in life.
In making of this dish,
you must always soak
the sliced bitter melon
in salt and lukewarm water
for at least five minutes,
or until the vegetable is al dente.
I'm not quite sure how
this dish came about
or where it came from.
However, I know this dish
is quite common across Asia,
and every culture and
family has their own recipe
and methods as well.
Growing up in the Philippines,
vegetables were a staple,
because my family could
barely afford meat.
To feed six children in a household,
my mom would often make
us stewed vegetables
with coconut milk, a stir fried
vegetable, such as this one.
The ingredients are relatively cheap
as they can all be grown
or picked from the garden.
When I was younger, I too
wasn't fond of this dish,
because I was addicted
to sweets (chuckling)
like any other kid.
However, you will have
to learn it the hard way
if you have a Filipino mom like mine.
But really though,
the flavor of ginisang
ampalaya tastes nostalgic.
And in Bisaya, before we
start our meal, we say,
(speaks in foreign language)
if you're with your family,
but if you're just by yourself, you say,
(speaks in foreign language).
(cheerful music)
- All right, I feel like
I've now had bitter gourd
cooked so many ways,
that the fact that this was just sauteed,
I don't know.
Here we go.
(Beryl chewing)
It's bitter, but I've had more bitter.
Whoa.
(Beryl chewing)
I like this.
I think it could use a little hot sauce,
and it's not to change the flavor,
just to add a little heat, you know?
(Beryl chewing)
I'm confused, because I feel
like I didn't do that much.
Maybe soaking it in the saltwater?
Like, there's like, a
hint of the bitterness,
but honestly, I like,
don't mind it at all.
It just has like, an
interesting flavor to me.
I, yeah, I like it.
Huh.
Confusing.
(Beryl chewing)
I feel so healthy right now.
Wow. Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow.
Who is she?
Who is this girl apparently
loving bitter gourd?
I'm eating my words. I'm
eating my bitter gourd.
I'm eating my words.
(happy instrumental music)
- Hi, my name is Nimra,
and I'm from Pakistan,
but I currently live in Glasgow, Scotland.
The dish I am going to
be talking about today
is called karela gosht.
It's typically prepared
with sauteed onions,
some lamb meat, bitter melon, some yogurt,
and some mixed Asian spices.
We've been eating this dish
in our family for generations.
And like, for as long as I can remember.
I feel like a lot of people
shy away from bitter melon
because of its bitter flavor.
And it's just not pleasant to eat
if it's not prepared in the correct way,
but my family uses salt
to wash the bitter melon,
and that takes away a lot
of the harshness from it.
So when it's made in the curry,
it sort of adds like, a sweet flavor.
Once mixed with the
spaces and with the lamb,
you cannot tell that it's bitter melon.
People are so surprised
when we serve it to them,
and they're like, "It
doesn't taste bitter at all."
It actually gives off
like, a sweet creaminess.
So yeah, we love eating it in our family.
Typically we eat it with fresh patties
with a little bit of butter,
alongside with some mint
and coriander chutney
that tastes really nice as well.
I feel like this combination of spices
and the preparation using the bitter melon
just makes the most amazing curry,
and I hope you'll enjoy it
as much as our family does.
- We have made it.
It has been a long week of
eating so much bitter gourd,
just so much, but it's been positive.
So we're finishing off
with a Pakistani lamb bitter gourd dish.
(Beryl chewing)
We're ending with a bang.
Oh my god.
This honestly, I can't even
actually taste the bitter gourd,
because the spices are just
so beautifully developed
on this dish.
This is so good.
Let's get some lamb.
(Beryl chewing)
I cooked the lamb perfectly.
(Beryl chewing)
The dish overall just has
a really nice texture,
and the bitter gourd is
still a little bit crunchy,
so it differentiates itself
from the sauteed onions and tomatoes,
but it's still soft.
If I didn't know any better,
I wouldn't even know there
was bitter gourd in this.
Rajat.
- [Rajat] What?
- Come here.
You don't like bitter gourd.
- I don't.
- Right, so just try this,
because I think that you would like this.
- [Rajat] I don't think I will.
- I know, but just try it.
I honestly think that you will like it.
(Rajat speaking faintly)
Come closer, come closer!
Say it to the microphone.
- [Rajat] It's still
bitter, but it's good.
- It's still bitter, but it's good.
You heard it here first, people.
We have converted the ultimate
naysayer of bitter gourd.
I'm an easier convert, you know, like I,
I begin wanting to like everything.
Overall, this was obviously
quite a successful episode.
My mind has definitely been changed.
We do have one more food
that I don't like left,
and it's canned anchovies.
So if you have a recipe that
you think will change my mind,
leave it in the comments.
I will go through and we'll do that one.
A big thank you to everybody
who submitted recipes.
And I will see you all in my next video.
