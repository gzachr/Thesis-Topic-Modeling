(Laughing)
(Music)
J:  Hello everyone. Merry Christmas. 
yeah, we are here at Lugnason
waterfall.  Here's our nice little hats
that we got for Christmas, we got them in
the market in Siquijor town,  we went
searching for three days, and on
Christmas Eve in typical Jamie fashion,
when he does his shopping on Christmas
Eve, we found the Hats.  It was only like
literally 30p each, so 60p for 2 - we was like
yeah, let's do it, let's go.  So yeah, we're on the way down to the
waterfall,  think there's a little cliff jump down here, a rope swing jump,
and yeah really nice, it's just a really
nice day. So
after this we're gonna go snorkeling
apparently in, what I've read online, is
the third best place in the world,
apparently, so you guys can be the judge
of that, and then we're going to end it
all with sunset on Paliton beach,
which is a really nice beach, really
quiet, nice beach with epic sunset.
So hopefully (mumbled) Christmas.  No snow for us, no presents unfortunately
but ... A:  Our present is travelling and being together.  J:  ... travelling and being together ...  sunshine,
so we're very grateful on this day for what we can do,
anyway, let's go to the waterfall
J:  Well!  Alice:  What happened to the water?  J:  Well guys I'm very sorry for
that hike up, that's very disappointing
because, I was here a year and a half
ago, and that was flowing I'm gonna try
and add a picture now when I was here
doing the jump, and this just looks like -  wow.
I've just spoken to a local and all the water has been diverted to a rice paddy, so that
is why there's no more waterfall.  But if you  go that way, and down there,  we've just come
from there, so let's cut to the clip right now.  A:  Nice hot springs.  J:  Hot springs so ...
J:  We couldn't come all this was not to get in the water, did we?  A:  No.  J:  Alice is getting in her little bikini right now ... as you can see bikini?
J:  And here's the spring.  Look at that, little spring
(Music)
Well guys.  it's Christmas Day, we're at a spring with the local people, let's have a little swim.
 
You know when you feel like someone's watching you?
 
J:  You having fun?  A:  Yes - are you?  J: Yes
Christmas Day, it's the best.
 
(Music)
A:  Right guts, now we've had a swim in the hot springs, we're now off to … J:  We're off to
another waterfall called Cambugahay waterfalls, bu tthen also, next to that
that waterfall, there's supposed to be a new waterfall, but I don't want to hype
anything up, Cambugahay, Cambugahay waterfalls, very nice, so
A:  We'll see you there.  J:  We'll see you there guys
(music)
J:  Hello guys, here we are at Lagaan Falls,  I've just done the swing, I'll insert that now.
 
A:  Let go.  (Splash)
J:  Look,  here's Alice about to do the rock slide ...
A:  Ready, steady,  go (screams)
(Alice screams, Jamie laughs, Alice laughs)
J:  Was that good?  (Alice laughing)
Let's go in the cave … come on.  How was that?  A:  That was cool.  I was like … errr am I gonna cut myself?
J:  There's a cave.
(Music)
J:  Are you ready?  A:  Yeah

J:  Go on,
