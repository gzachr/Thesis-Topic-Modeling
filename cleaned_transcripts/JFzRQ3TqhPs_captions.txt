nice to meet you man nice to meet you
you
to okay man thank you so much thank you
so much for your service thank you is
that a cultural thing yes like
like like I said look she's preparing
herself you are you are fine what's
going on guys welcome to another video
in the Philippines this is technically
actually my first day in Manila you
guessed
it it's raining
is raining season here in Manila and I'm
here for the next 3 days I wanted to
kind of check out a few places that I
read about right now I'm in a place
called how you doing morning I'm in a
place called
maati um I thought it was like it's it's
part of BGC upper BGC I'm not quite sure
but I am heading to more of like the
downtown BGC to give something to eat it
is 2 in the afternoon it has been
raining all day and I've just been stuck
in my room so right now we're going to
is that a block of
ice
oh right now we're going to head to uh
BGC get something to eat and start this
video all right
[Music]
guys now if you're wondering what those
are those are tricycles I haven't had a
chance to ride them but they look super
fun I think where I'm heading to they're
not really in the Aira this is kind of
like more of the other part of the
neighborhood where to get through BGC
it's a lot easier to maneuver through
the
tricycles so I'm just up ahead like five
more minutes then we'll get there right
now yeah you can see as we're heading
out of the maati area there's a lot of
food stands
here lot of morning
morning a lot of food stands here a lot
of fried chicken a lot of
bakeries a lot of
tricycles Mocha Cafe
spots food Foods everywhere all kinds of
foods but mostly like fried
food uh treats
desserts you name it it's all here so
now I'm entering the BGC area it's
completely
changed see the tall buildings and
whatnot I literally just came from that
corner over
there yeah I think on a regular day this
would be a lot
prettier but we're I'm just going to
make a quick ride I'm looking for
something to eat I'm so
hungry
oh that's
awesome mall over here that I discovered
it's really cool uh I may want to want
to check that
out not that I need to buy anything but
it it really caught my attention uh last
night this the first time I may want to
check that out to you guys but yeah this
is a it's pretty nice kind of like a
Singapore almost dude I think that's
wild how literally the demographic of
people just changed within just a couple
feet away I was literally walking in an
area where it looked very poor and
impoverished lot of fried food on the
corners and then just 5 minutes down the
road it looks like New York City and
there's a different demographic of
people looking very Posh here that is
wild so I'm here at a Randy's Donuts
really nice spot and I've noticed there
is a lot of dut stands bakeries around
here there's a lot of bakeries here in
the
Philippines uh I'm not sure if I should
just get donuts or kind of like sit down
in a place but this is what they offer
and they have a lot of different types
of donuts I would like the
strawberry that one that's
one
two three so I end up getting the
assorted which is a 700 pesos it just
economically makes more sense and that's
kind of like the ones I wanted anyways
okay man thank you so much thank you so
much for your service thank you okay so
I just had a piece of the donut um it's
pretty good but I made a small
miscalculation I have to head back to
where I'm
staying because I'm literally carrying
this everywhere I
go so it actually would have been
better if I had just bought something
and sat down and ate instead of having
to car this with me how you doing
boss so now I have to walk all the way
back to where I'm staying just to drop
this off and we're going to lose some
time unfortunately so I'll see you back
at the at the spot all right guys just
say hi to the
camera yo these are my new guy friends

and then hey what's up
man so uh yeah I'm just vlogging yoube
vlogg this
ISO you guys are really awesome thank
you he's really polite really polite
really
polite yeah thank you yeah yeah it's a
little humid so I'm about to start
walking I'll be back though okay
thank you I had to change my clothes for
a second because I had to drop my
clothes at the washing machine the
laundromat
whatever
but I'm inside the BGC and this lady
just gave me this thing right here which
is kind of like the new apartments of
they're building but it's actually this
place right
here that is pretty tall I'm not not
exactly sure the target audience that
they're looking for maybe foreigners
maybe Filipinos a lot of money but it
looks like they're still building new
infrastructure here in
BGC uh I don't have a wide map of this
place but I'm going to try and cover a
lot of ground with my feet and really
show you guys this brand new area that's
really the Singapore of the Philippines
now right here in this area you can see
behind me that there's people running
it's like midday right now now and these
are not like Filipinos I'm seen like
foreigners Europeans Koreans they're
actually jogging around over here it
gives you an idea of like how upscale
this area is instead of like really
hanging out working out at like a park
you can just clear visibly see it right
here in the middle of uh downtown which
is the other side of it right
here so this is one of the residence
buildings too I think that's probably
why this the best alternative for uh
working out
this is the Mega World Uptown Mall I've
been eyeing it since I got here I want
to try and check it out cuz I see that
it crosses to a bridge up there to the
other side and it looks like you can
rent these
bikes how to ride find your ride scan
don't forget a helmet pretty simple not
a lot of bikes these are more of like
people who own the bikes not so much
renting so it looks like there's only
three available over
here looks like I found entrance Mall
which is Straight
Ahead at first
glance um we are in the Christmas season
right now so you see a lot of that
here very pretty Mall very pretty
Mall what you guys don't see or actually
smell it smells really nice here it
could be because of all this cologne
right
here very nice pretty top
tier all right oh sorry go
ahead uh I smell like pasta pasta yeah
yeah yeah is this like a pasta is this a
pasta only pasta no
with also like rice milal soup salad
rice meals and salad okay I smelled
pasta from over there and I'm like I see
it like this stuff right here okay so
it's like a pasta and and what else uh
like uh with rice soup salad soup salad
okay is this like more of like a
cafeteria
food I don't think so sir Italian
restant Italian yes sir oh okay okay and
