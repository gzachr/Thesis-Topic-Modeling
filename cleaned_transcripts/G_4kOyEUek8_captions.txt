today i'm going to be heading out to the
market to pick up some goods
but uh
because
this guy here such a process to make i'd
like to get it on the uh on the stove
first
so this is uh called lechon kawali
this takes about
probably an hour to brine and then i
dry it in the oven and then i finish it
off in the fryer while this thing is
boiling we really got to go to the
market the beef has to be on there like
now this is paulie paulie is i guess
he's like my sous chef i guess you're a
sous chef right i guess so i guess so
yeah i've known this guy for i don't
know maybe
over 25 years yeah well you're 42. so oh
yeah at least 20 years while i'm out
he's going to go and start putting stuff
together i think he's going to work on
the minute high five

later just just
sit still all right
look after these guys this guy right
here this guy he's the loudest one he's
the biggest he's got the biggest bark
he was like harassing me

here bobby bobby's my gun man he's my
he's my meat guy he's been here 30 years
awesome dude 27 37. there you go bob i'm
going to pick up some shanks
this is the tastiest thing ever the only
thing is
you have to cook it float in a long time
can i get you to cut it crosstalk by the
bulb
[Applause]
thank you sir i'll see you
right one starts to creep into like 11
that's when the the panic sort of uh
starts to creep in but get the beef on
there
and uh should be on time
should be
first a few of these guys
so what i'm gonna be making right now is
my
for me i just like
being with my friend like you know he's
my one of my best friends and it's like
it's fun just working with him you know
just
get each other's jokes and so and get
paid not enough though not enough
do you hear that wes not enough
so this is what keeps my uh
my lovely locks
lock down
[Music]
okay that smells good man yep you didn't
pick it up right
don't you season it yet no no make it
super super salty man okay so it's 11
15. we really get a hustle we really got
to get this stuff going otherwise
we'll be
scrambling again brother yep how's that
hey put more man put more yeah if you're
not getting the salt you need to put
more all right
so get this guy in there the oven is
already preheated and all we're really
doing is just drying it
so popping this guy in the oven
but i'm gonna start doing the beef so we
just came back from the market
went to go see our friend bobby and hook
this up with some nice
beautiful
shank there you go kind of do it you
know do a little turn is that good right
there bam
to pull this together it's gonna take
about about three hours till we have to
just start rolling now
but the beef that i'm offering this week
is called beef machado our dish are
mainly made with a lot of i guess you
would say cheap cuts but we make such
beautiful dishes out of it right beef
machado is made with this like hearty
tomato sauce it takes about
anywhere between three and four hours to
make the goal is to have all the the
heavy meat dishes on the go by 10 11
o'clock it should already be moving
first thing i'm going to do is i'm going
to start frying these guys i mean we're
a little bit behind today because we ran
in the market but it doesn't mean we're
late it just means we're not on schedule
but i love filipino food i love it i
don't know if i'm allowed to say this
but the one thing that really bugs me
about filipino food and just in our
culture in general is that like our food
is looked at as something cheap you know
and it's far from man it's far from
cheap
a few uh cloves of garlic in there so
all that flavor in there i just want to
lift it that's what i want some tomato
onions
the things that go into it the love that
goes into it the flavors that come out
of the kitchen that translate into this
beautiful beautiful dishes is nothing
less than spectacular see i love how
like the bone marrow is still like
in there so by the time this is done all
that stuff is just
all mixed in
in the sauce there three different kinds
of soy sauce
[Music]
and just let it let it do its thing so
i'm gonna start the pork pork adobo is
another dish that's like if you're a
filipino you need
you know adobo it's like it's it's your
dna so we've pre-cut these guys already
as part of our prep so the first step is
to
cook this guy down
and then get all the uh the oils out
of the pork then you sort of just fry it
in its own uh
fat
there's a lot of stuff that goes into it
uh the most basic ingredient for adobo
is really soy
garlic
onions and vinegar once everything is
done there's about seven to eleven uh
ingredients in there if you're gonna
cook based on measurement you're cooking
based on someone else's
technique the way i cook it's all by
feel right and there's a sense of
honesty that comes out of that right
because you're really just cooking
from
you know
from the heart i guess that sounds kind
of corny but that's that's sort of like
how it is you know
yeah so the final step of this dish is
the the vinegar again i don't measure i
would say that's maybe what a quarter
cup the rule is that you don't stir it
once you put it on just let it simmer
for a little bit
why do we do it i
don't really know i just i was just told
not to
touch it once you put the vinegar so
i do it like that and it comes out
it comes out magic now i can start
staring this bad boy
like everybody knows adobo in our
culture everybody has their own version
often times when you have adobo it's
always you know you'll hear the my my
lola which is my grandma or my lolo
grandpa
makes it the best so my dad makes it the
best but to be honest with you dude
mine's the best
it's like one thousand percent well my
mom's is the best bro
even your mom said mine is the best it's
kind of good that's what she said
it's that right like when you ask me
why don't you stir it when you put the
vinegar well this is why
yeah well this is why
this is why
one of my customers that i'm delivering
to today i could even show you in thread
it's hilarious they specifically wait
for the adobo to drop and then they just
order like three four of them so that
they could hold it for the week until my
next run
so
is my adobo good
right
rice is cooked right i think we have
about three orders of wings uh so that
will be uh
i think we could do that together that'd
be cool yeah like i said we're not on
schedule but we're on track dude
let's go
just basic seasoning here salt pepper
just like massage that guy in there
probably just put in the uh the first
batch and we're doing the first fry
after this we take it out let it sit for
a little bit and then put it in for the
final fry and that's what's gonna give
it the crispiness that we want like all
this thing is so funny dude like you
know how we started
you know we've obviously lived very
different lives you know we we grew up
doing
[ __ ] together right went to high school
together
we did a whole bunch of stuff so
again he's older than i am but we were
in the same class
and like look at us now dude like we're
like side by side like building building
something great together and i wouldn't
do this with anybody else man i have
beer
that's the uh that's the history of us
man so this is the second fry for wings
it's ready for uh dressing this is the
uh this our sweet chili sauce
we've worked been working on the
branding for a while and we finally
start getting uh got our stamps in our
stickers that's a pretty big deal for us
so it feels a little bit more real you
open it
legit i guess like we've always been
legit but it's like yeah it's good
seeing your project come to life the way
that it's happening now it's like it's
pretty special man being on the other
side of that like as a project manager
working on clients to do you know to
work in their dreams it's it's different
let's put a little bit of garlic of
course
you guys know bawang means garlic right
so this is their
anato oil
that's the wings right there man that's
the famous
sweet chili wings that we offer
by 3 30 everything should be done and
then we start bagging four o'clock by
five i should be out of here
yeah good i'm good
and this sort of happens super fast
yeah so these are the the side
these that go with our dish yeah this is
good to go
[Music]
it's all done right it's all good yeah
so now i'm gonna do the the beef machado
take the potatoes that we
double fry
and then
start laying out the meat and that's our
beef machar
that one is stuck
yeah i think the pork is done
like this is
like you could eat it like that
but the way we do it extra extra love
you ready
see how that starts to bubble up there
you see that
that's three hours of work right there
that's why when you say what makes a
fried pork dish delicious it needs to be
crispy man and this is it you know when
i first started this i didn't know what
i was doing i just knew how to cook all
right
and i didn't know the business side of
it i didn't know how people are going to
react to it and now that i've gotten so
many dishes out the door and i've met so
many people the confidence level is
definitely up there to a point where
like man i fantasize about jumping into
a restaurant right and then i thought
about it i'm like wait a minute like the
world is upside down right now it
doesn't make sense for me to open a
restaurant right now
you know maybe not but i think i'm
pretty worthy of you know putting out
something really delicious you know
so that's that's one order right there
so i'm gonna be here in about probably 5
15. right
everything needs to be back by then sure
all right
give me time as long as you give me a
little bit of time so the last part of
this story is now me hopping on my bike
getting my ass to my place pick up the
car and head back here pick up the goods
and delivery
[Applause]
[Music]
just waiting on them
always as per usual
[Music]
at the end of it like we're still we're
still like really good friends
well forget about me when you when
you're like this big right
bro come on guy
oh i you know you don't know
both they both have the tron but one has
wings and one is adobo
perfect perfect now
i'm gonna just help you with the other
one yeah okay grab it cool okay
everything's here yep good yep okay
let's go
good luck man
bro i'm on my way be there in like 10
minutes less i work 14 to 18 hours a day
man a day that's a grind see you soon
you know and i go home with my 10 margin
and i still feel like i don't feel dude
i don't feel deflated at all i did this
out of like love and passion and then
when i see people like actually reach
out and grab it and post it and
celebrate it you know people like
build date nights around my food which
is crazy you know and people that have
never had filipino food before i are
trying it with me for the first time
like who the [ __ ] am i you know what i
mean it's like that's
the last door of the day and that's the
dude that's that's the thing that makes
me feel like yeah i'm actually doing
something that one i love too that makes
sense and three people actually
appreciate it okay peace
these guys order from me almost every
week and that's the thing that that
that drives it home man you know there's
this level of satisfaction that that you
get when you finish your run and then
you have people like that that just
appreciates everything that you put out
just amazing man just an amazing feeling
you know
[Music]
