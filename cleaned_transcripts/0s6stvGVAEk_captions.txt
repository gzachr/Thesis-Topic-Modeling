Hey guys today Rei and I are gonna show you how we cook Kaldereta with an instant pot!
Kaldereta is a Filipino meat stew that is traditionally cooked with goat meat, but for those who can't stomach goat meat, today
we'll be using beef short ribs.First, we're going to saute half a large onion until it starts to look translucent.
Then add four cloves of garlic and saute until fragrant.
Next stir in 1 teaspoon of annatto powder.
Then add about three and a half pounds of beef short ribs and sear the sides a little.
Afterwards add one-and-a-half cups of water, followed by one and a half cups of beef broth, and a half cup of unsalted tomato sauce.
At this point set your instant pot at high pressure on the meat/stew setting for 15 minutes.
And set the steam release to the 'sealing' setting
When it's done quick release the pressure inside the pot until the float valve unlocks. This will allow you to quickly and safely
open the lid. Once you have it open scoop out any excess fat at the top and then transfer everything to a different pot.
Next add four tablespoons of liver pat√© and then one teaspoon of salt.
Allow it to simmer for about 25 minutes.
Afterwards throw in three medium-sized red potatoes and two large carrots.
Let it simmer for another 15 minutes or until the potatoes are cooked.
Now you want to put half a cup of peeled garbanzo beans, one chopped red pepper, and green olives.
Simmer for another five to 10 minutes. Salt to taste if needed.
Otherwise your Kaldereta is all done. Now all you need to do is plate it next to a scoop of white rice and
pour a little bit of the sauce.
And let's eat!
