it's kicking in the sweetness oh
oh i didn't expect that
oh my god that's the twist
hi i'm chantal and today i'm going to be
trying other filipino women's cassava
cake cassava cake a server cake
i don't really eat or cook cassava cake
very often
cassava cake is unique to philippines
cassava is a root crop
it's also called manyok for filipinos we
make it as a cake the ideal cassava cake
would look quite thick and it would have
this brown kind of
surface on the top kind of what you use
in a lot of parties i feel like it's
just that dish that you want to have at
those kind of events because it's not
that quick to make
the most important properties of cassava
cake is
the cassava
the milk eggs and sugar what do other
people say about yoga
of course they love it come on why
wouldn't they
[Laughter]
my cooking is fairly good
i would say microsoft cake is really
really good considering i've only cooked
it twice
looks like a salad cake
smells like a server cake
not much smell
only slight
it smells cheesy
that means there's a lot of cheese which
is going to be like nice and
like creamy and all that stuff you know
it may look simple there's no frills or
anything but if it tastes good like a
favorite cake it will be amazing
i think it needs to add more
a bit more condensed milk texture is
really good dirty
not too
soft
so moist
it's really good
creamy
exactly what i want creamy i think the
top is cheese
to me tastes a little bit like cheesy
toppings i'm not entirely sure
i'm not fan of cheese on top of cassava
cake the look is really good and it's
okay the taste is not too
it's just a little bit more
i feel like i'm just missing um
the music and the people
i'll give this one
an eight
so it's an eight for me
i'll just say seven out of ten
my cassava cake is scrumptious
is that too much boasting
oh
look at the coconuts in there
it smells nice
i smell the cheese
this
topping looks really good but
it's the one thing i don't like to see
it's hard it's not edible it's from the
coconuts
oh
that's nice
this is good
it's really well done look it's almost
like it's fluffy
i like the taste of the top bit
it's so nice and creamy
no it's kicking in the sweetness
i feel like oh
oh
so much texture to it which is really
nice
not too crazy it was nice at first but
when
gradually it kicks in and it's quite
it's
it's i think it's too sweet
really really nice when you eat it it's
just like full of flavor
just need a little bit of that crusty
caramelized on top well i think it's too
much
it's too much it's too thick is there
anything you borrow from this recipe i
would not borrow anything on this i'd
love to learn the glaze how they've done
that
um i'll score it actually six out of ten
i give it a nine this cassava cake is
nine out of ten
[Music]
i'm not going to lie this is the first
time i make cassava cake my cassava cake
is creamy and a little bit citrusy
[Applause]
classic cassava i see
it's got that caramel crust i was
looking for
that's nice
it doesn't have cheese so i'm happy
the top layer looks a little bit thicker
than usual than what i'm used to seeing
golden brown on top that burnt which i
like but also the bird bits on the on
the sides and the top which will add
flavors to it
i'm quite used to it being a little bit
less thick
sweet that's nice
i really liking this one
there's something in it
but for some reason i can taste cheese
i love cheese
but
i'm not a fan of it in cassava cake
i like the burnt side
it's nice the burnt bars and the taste
and the softness i think the main
cassava cake part could probably do with
a little bit more sweetness
it's just it just needs a little bit
more for me more sweetness more
creaminess just not quite enough
maybe just lessen the sugar a little bit
but otherwise it's a really good cassava
cake
eight out of ten
this cassava cake is seven out of ten
eight out of ten
my cassava cake is a lovely beautiful
nice and delicious there is the
ingredient there which is the jackfruit
it's a bit of a difference on the
cassava hmm
this looks like mine
it's solid i like that
it's got that layer so that's quite
exciting love that it's got a little bit
of like burnt bit on top because i think
that gives it a bit of depth and flavor
oh
i've never had jackfruit in my cassava
before
revolutionary
or not
oh
i like that texture
it's very creamy
not fluffy creamy
oh i like the jackfruit in it it's
really good
that's so clever
and the jackfruit really adds something
to it
i like it
jackfruit
can become overpowering i think
slight sweetness of it is coming from
the jackfruit for sure and i love
jackfruit i would definitely borrow the
jackfruit from this recipe that is such
a good idea i've never actually seen
that before
the top
it it just melts
just really really
satisfying
i give this cassava cake a 9 out of 10.
i would give this an eight out of ten i
think it's got all the factors of a
cassava cake
for me
personally wouldn't add jackfruit so the
score i would give this cassava cake is
eight out of ten actually can i change
it i think it's a nine out of 10. okay
the best cassava
there's secret though you see
oh that's
sad
[Music]
you
