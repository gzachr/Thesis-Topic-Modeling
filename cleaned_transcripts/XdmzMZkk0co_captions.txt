(gentle music)
- I met you briefly in 2015
at a travel convention in Bangkok.
I was a newbie travel
blogger with shaggy hair
who wasn't really
looking for a girlfriend.
However, when we first
locked eyes on each other,
I was attracted beyond belief
and I knew I needed to
get to know you better.
Then we started messaging on Instagram,
and a few weeks later,
you picked me up at the airport in Manila
and we went straight to a nightclub.
We were both 24 years old.
And I'm pretty sure that
it was love at first sight.
Over that first week we spent together,
we partied every day.
We ate street food.
I don't know how people here eat it.
Oh-oh-oh, yeah.
You showed me around your city
and we had a blast.
Even if we didn't know
each other that well,
everything sort of clicked.
So we're here at the Mall of
Asia with my friend, Deanna.
- Hi.
- And she's gonna show me
around this huge place.
I'll never forget that
warm, fuzzy feeling I had
while waiting for my flight
to depart from Manila
at Terminal 4.
I was a hundred percent sure
that something very special had happened.
I called my best friend and
told him that you were the one.
And I was hoping that you felt the same
but was worried that you thought otherwise
because I was constantly traveling.
Maybe you thought it was
an infatuation or a dream.
But two months later,
I sent you a one-way
ticket to the Philippines
and then we set off to travel the world.
(bright music)
We went to Vietnam to eat some pho,
Fiji to go scuba diving,
Singapore to binge eat
as much as we could,
and New Zealand to go bungee jumping.
Woooo!
We really didn't stop traveling
because we both work remotely.
Every place we went became our home.
- Aaaah! Aah! Oh, my God.
Oh. Oh, my God.
- It's okay. It's normal.
It's normal. It's normal.
- Ohh. Aaah!
- Cheers.
- Cheers.
- I had spent my entire life
searching for someone like you.
And it just happened.
We both shared that same adrenaline rush,
that same overpowering sensation
that just can't be explained in words.
Deanna, not only are you
my absolute dream girl,
but you're the most beautiful
person I've ever laid eyes on.
I still have to pinch myself sometimes
because I feel like you're
way out of my league.
I truly consider myself the luckiest man
in the entire world.
You are adventurous.
You are hilarious.
(Deanna laughing)
And most of all, you are caring.
You've taught me to be a better person,
to have a bigger heart,
and to always think about
others before yourself.
You constantly pushed
me to reach my potential
and I am forever grateful for
your support as a best friend
and your love as a soulmate.
I am constantly amazed by how
smart and sincere you are.
My manager,
ladies and gentlemen,
(Deanna laughing)
Deanna Sallao.
She's the brains behind everything.
I've watched you blossom
from a corporate employee
into a serial entrepreneur,
starting one of Asia's
fastest growing businesses,
in the last 18 months.
I thought it was
impossible to find someone
that is equally as
beautiful, as intelligent,
but you are the one.
We've grown so much together
over the last six years,
traveling to over 70 countries
on all seven continents.
Hey guys, I'm walking and I'm
with the love of my life here
in Santo Domingo in
the Dominican Republic.
- It's amazing.
- Babe, where are we?
- Oslo.
Lahore.
And the Dead Sea.
Cambodia.
And now we're in Chile.
- I could write a book
with all the memories
we've shared together around the world.
Like that time in Antarctica,
when you saw snow falling
for the very first time.
- It's so beautiful.
- Are you crying?
- Mm-hmm.
- Or that time we visited
all those beautiful mosques in Iran.
What an amazing country.
Do you remember that
community we spent a day with
in a remote town in Eastern Greenland?
Or when we spontaneously
went skydiving in Australia?
On your 27th birthday,
I picked you up from the airport in Paris
and surprised you with a photo
shoot at the Eiffel Tower.
That was one of the best days of my life.
We spent New Year's sleeping
next to the giraffes
in the Serengeti.
We attended the Olympics
in Rio de Janeiro.
We drove across the beautiful
white salt flats of Bolivia.
We got lost wandering around
the temples in Myanmar.
We hiked waterfalls in Mauritius. (smacks)
We saw sunrise in Angkor Wat in Cambodia
and sunset in beautiful Indonesia.
And how could I ever forget
that 24-hour layover in Seoul
where we binge ate our favorite cuisine,
which we still eat twice a week.
Best meal in the world?
- Mm-hmm.
- I can't wait to continue making memories
as we start this next
chapter of our lives,
with our baby boy pug
and our brand new home that
we are about to move into.
Through all the ups,
all the downs,
and everything in between,
I love you with all my heart
and I can't imagine
going through this life
with anyone else but you.
(door latch clicks)
Whoa.
- Ohh. (sobs)
- Oh, my God. (chuckles)
(smacks) Deanna, from the moment I met you
six years ago in Manila,
I knew you were the one.
(Deanna crying)
I'll never forget that warm, fuzzy feeling
I had at Terminal 4
airport when I left you.
And something was pulling me back.
And then I sent you a one-way ticket.
Remember?
(Deanna sniffling)
And the rest is history.
- Yeah.
- You're the best thing
that ever happened to me.
We've grown together so much
in so many ways.
And I can't wait to start
this next chapter of our life
right here in our new home. (smacks)
(Deanna sobbing and sniffling)
Deanna Fae Visperas,
- Oh, my God.
- will you marry me?
- (sniffles) Oh, my God, yes.
Can you slap me?
(smacks)
Oh, my God.
- I love you.
(smacks)
(Deanna gasps)
- Oh, my God, I love you.
- I love you so much.
- Huh. (exhales)
