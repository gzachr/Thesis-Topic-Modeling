hello guys welcome back to Pinoy Planet
so today I will make puto calasiao!
Puto Calasiao is a very nice
merienda or snack from the Philippines
it's also called rice cake and so I
will explain a little bit about the
ingredients that I will use okay we will
be using this puto instant mix 1 cup of
water will use 2 eggs and finally some
butter and brown sugar and for the
toppings we will use a Dutch cheese okay
so I'm gonna open this this instant mix
for puto calasiao there we go
I'll be mixing all ingredients in this
bowl first
okay so I will add the puto mixture
in water it's the first time for me to
make it
I almost didn't notice guys but
inside the pack there was a another
small package with coconut powder so
this one I'm gonna add as well otherwise
it would not have been puto here so
finally I'm gonna add the eggs
and butter 1 tablespoon I will first mix
everything with the spoon and then
afterwards with the whisk so let's mix
this up
ok next I'm going to use the
whisk to make everything more smooth you
might have noticed that the colors
became a little bit Brown so it's not so
white but I think puto they can be they
can come in many different colors right
I've seen white ones and more yellow
brown and perhaps even like ube color
purple so how do you eat your puto do
you put cheese on top or salted egg or
is there any other way of eating it and
when do you eat it, what combination with
breakfast with dinner let me know in the
comments okay okay so next I'm gonna
fill up these cake forms with the
mixture I already preheated the oven at
180 degrees Celsius so how do you make
puto it do you steam it or do you put it
in the oven I would like to know which
is your preferred way so let's fill these
okay sige na I think it's time to put
them in the oven so let's go inside okay
so let's put them in the oven for 15
minutes guys that took them out of the
oven for a few minutes because I want to
put the cheese or keso Dutch cheese
and then I'll put it back Dutch cheese
or keso as you can see they're already
becoming bigger now I'm gonna put them
back for another 10 minutes
let's try guys I took them out of the
oven so here they are puto calasiao
with cheese, keso I let them cool off
for about 15 minutes so let me let me
take the time to make a shout out I hope
I pronounced it right miss Lalyn Sarlatan
Thank you so much for being a
member of pinoy planet so let's have a
look at the puto calasiao I hope
they are good so let's take them out you
see they became much bigger
I hope they look all right
okay so let's taste
wow that's a lot of cheese wow
they're nice they're really good and
I like these it actually it's a it's more
like a cupcake I think so I know in the
