we're the Lockwoods and we're traveling the 
world to experience up close and in person  
all the natural wonders and distinct cultures that 
our kids would otherwise be seen only in textbooks  
and TV today we're leaving our Beachside rooms 
in donsul where we try to unsuccessfully to swim  
with the local whale sharks we're flying to the 
island of Siargao but our first of two flights is  
already delayed by an hour putting our connection 
in Manila at risk will we make it to the laid-back  
surf destination this afternoon or will we have 
to come up with an exciting Plan B let's get to  
it we left Elysia Beach Resort and we're headed to 
Siargao but there is a problem I just got an email  
from the airline and they are delaying our flight 
in an hour that's kind of a big problem because  
our connection in vanilla was only an hour so 
until we get to the airport and talk to somebody  
we have no idea if we're missing our flight 
completely or if they're gonna hold the plane  
or wait to stay the night in Manila I don't know 
not everybody seems as concerned as we are [Music]  
let's see what's gonna happen with this flight
all they want when we go to the airport 
is Kinder eggs every single time
tomorrow tomorrow so our conundrum is this we 
have to decide right now what we want to do about  
the second flight the connection from Manila to 
chargell it looks like our luggage will go all the  
way to Siargao even if we end up having to stay 
in Manila and that's not a great option because  
we won't have toothbrushes or clothes or anything 
like that they said that they could tag our stuff  
our luggage just to go to Manila the problem there 
is we already have a super tight turnaround like  
10 minutes to get to our next flight if we then 
have to go get baggage from the baggage carousel  
go out go back through security recheck those 
bags there's no way we're going to make it to  
our flight unless that flight is delayed we're 
getting a printed certificate the flight change  
making us miss our flight and we are going to 
submit a claim to our travel insurance company  
and so we'll be reimbursed for any inconvenience 
this has if you want to learn more about the  
travel insurance we use go to followabc.com/travelinsurance 
now the challenge is going to be how we  
make the best of this okay so since we know we are 
actually staying in Manila for the night we just  
have to figure out what we could possibly do to 
pass the time could we hang out with guys we have  
some bad news and some good news bad news is that 
we are missing our connecting flight to shark out  
tonight which means we're staying the night in 
Manila and we're gonna hang out with Mom duties
we can't wait to see you have dinner with Mom too 
it's funny how things work out I never expected  
our second collab with them to be so soon this 
is like two days later but there are still some  
other parts that we have to fit together we have 
a resort in siargao that we're missing a night  
on and we're missing a full day in Chicago that 
we had all these activities planned for so we're  
gonna have to rearrange and wrap our heads around 
that so I've got to get on email with the resort  
and the tour company that we were going through 
so it's gonna be a busy afternoon of sorting some  
things out I'm so sorry Aaron's gonna get some 
work done while we're on the plane do some editing  
we've been trying to get this short video up on 
YouTube for the past couple of days but since we  
haven't had any real internet for a couple of 
days it's been nearly impossible so that's one  
nice thing about being in Manila for the night 
we'll be able to get our uploads done we're on  
Final Approach into Manila and I just realized we 
still don't know where we're gonna stay tonight we  
want to try someplace different than the other two 
times we stayed in Manila we've had some really  
good luck in the Philippines with the Shangri-La 
brand so there's one that's right in the heart of  
BGC it's called the fort and it's right off of 
High Street so I think we're gonna give that a  
try but we're just gonna show up and see what kind 
of a rate and room we can get just grabbed our cab  
it's about 20 minutes to get from the airport to 
BGC where we're staying hopefully they have a room
we're here they do have a room for us they 
actually have two rooms for us we're gonna  
get connecting rooms because our travel insurance 
covers all four of us which means we have a little  
extra budget for our room tonight [Music] our 
rooms are great connecting of course and we've  
got the king and the kids have two queen beds in 
there are they doubles or bed please they're twins  
they're twin beds so the kids have twin beds see 
we've destroyed the rooms already because we've  
all taken showers and I haven't even seen their 
room yet we're in a rush because we want to go  
see our friends but we've always really like 
staying at the shangri-las that's why we chose  
it and we've stayed at them before in Boracay 
and Cebu what is with them so we wanted to give  
it a try in Manila all right you guys ready go 
see our friends let's hit the road go [Music]
um [Music]
start off by checking out Samba that's in 
our hotel that might be the easiest plan  
because it's actually Chinese New Year today 
so everybody's celebrating some of the streets  
are blocked off they're having parades and a 
lot of the restaurants are booked or closed  
it's only 4:37 right now most things don't 
open until five but I think we're gonna find  
a seat outside on the pool patio where the 
bar is open at least start with a couple of  
cocktails finally Phil's got some drinking 
buddies sometimes I drink not all the time
you missed our whole dinner and our drinks 
because the Shangri-La does not allow videoing  
don't tell them we're doing it on our way 
out but we're moving on to the next spot  
and we have a lot to catch up on here's 
the plan we are going to explore Manila  
by restaurant hopping a bit so number one down 
that's where we're staying and now we're going  
out and about we've been talking all week 
about how Chinese new year is coming  
up but now it's officially Chinese New Year 
like literally today last night was the Eve  
so a lot of the streets here are closed down 
and they're having a big festivities that also  
means it's pretty hard to get into a lot of the 
places around here so we're not even sure where  
we're going to be able to get some cocktails 
we're just gonna go with the flow roll with  
punches we are making a little stop just 
for the kids that they have been promised  
some boba tea I don't think Colt or Brooklyn 
have ever had boba tea we're going to Yi thing
please
shake it until it's cold and then 
you're just gonna poke a hole like this
winter winter melon winter melon young I hate 
how we keep getting balls do they taste good  
or something so there's tapioca pearls which 
are basically uh they're made out of tapioca  
starch it's warm that's why it's warm and 
then they put in cold are you supposed to
I might do the Wednesday dance [Music]
Talent right there we're gonna try and 
see if we can get into Seda BGC really  
cool rooftop bar but it's a crowded night and 
they're gonna be fireworks tonight so Rooftop  
Bar is gonna be perfect for it but only if 
we can get up there in the next 20 minutes
we made it up here just in time 
for the fireworks and there's
front of them going off Kung Hay Fat Choi that 
means happy New Year in Chinese Nelvine sweet  
talked his way into this big private room over 
here so we're going in there for the rest of the  
night there's a dining room and a living room 
this is an amazing little spread for us to hang  
out in for the night happy New Year again since 
this is a fortunate accident for us and we made  
the best out of what could have been a really 
frustrating situation we want to know what Mom  
duties most difficult travel day was oh yeah four 
days is that from Vietnam that was three days just  
took us a really long time to get from one place 
to another and with kids yeah it's very difficult
new question for mom duty what advice would 
you give to people who feel like traveling  
with kids is too hard oh man well first of all 
when it comes to a family it's not just about  
the kids it's also about the parents and a big 
part of the parents lives is looking through  
their eyes right for us when the parents 
are happy right there's a happy family
[Music]
when you found out that you're gonna be 
traveling the way you're doing right now  
how did you feel I was excited beyond belief 
like I felt so antsy to get out of you know  
our whatever routine we were in that I couldn't 
wait to go and do something different and get  
out of our comfort zone Scotch Scotch Scotch 
we honestly have not partied like this they  
finished this not Rocio and I the boys they 
finished this we have not partied this hard  
or this late in such a long time it is past 
midnight now oh my gosh and now guess what  
we have a flight tomorrow that we can't miss 
so I guess we won't see them for a very long  
time until we miss another flight that's right 
we're gonna see them in like a couple of hours  
we're having brunch together too so they are taking 
us to a favorite brunch spot in Manila [Music]
BGC is an extremely new area of town like 
literally didn't even begin planning stages until  
the mid 90s so most of the stuff that you see 
around here was built in the 2000s and just like  
our friends it's a great hub for travelers and a 
lot of expats want to come and live here because  
they have a really great internet infrastructure 
and a lot of golf courses so there's recreation  
and a quite a number of museums just like the Mind
Museum that we visited a few days ago two of the  
top universities in the country are right here and 
this specific area is called Bonifacio Global City  
and that is named after Bonifacio Fort which was 
the Filipino national army base and it's really  
close to the Manila airport a major Hub it's 
the biggest airport in the Philippines so you  
can pretty much get to anywhere any nearby 
southeast Asia country and of course any  
where in the Philippines Manila is going to 
be your connection and we're just walking  
into Tipsy Pig to meet up with our friends 
for a farewell breakfast for real this time  
and the party continues how you doing 
man good morning long time no see  
so tipty pig is actually like their 
favorite place here for breakfast I'm  
getting a classic Filipino breakfast The 
Tipsy tapa I've seen tapa all over the  
place and I've not gotten it yet funny story I 
took Phil's breakfast this is not Tapas at all  
this is beef Tapas we're gonna have our 
breakfast and we are gonna catch up as  
much as we can before we head to the airport 
and fingers crossed we get our next flight or  
maybe not done stay tuned well it's time to say 
goodbye and I don't think this is going to be easy
we're going to be
friends but I think especially Brooklyn and Nia 
and I'm just so happy oh this is definitely not  
the last goodbye love you guys okay thank you 
that goodbye was so hard but now it's time for  
trying to get to chargao take two it's such a 
shame to leave this beautiful weather it has  
been perfect here in Manila security tells 
us that we are at the wrong terminal for  
Philippine Airlines domestic we're in terminal 3 
which is where our hotel bellhop and taxi driver  
took us but now we're coming way down here to 
see if that's correct it looks like we might  
have to take a taxi over to Terminal 2 Comedy of 
Errors it is a 15-minute taxi ride from terminal  
3 where we were dropped off at to Terminal 
2 where we need to be and we're cutting it  
really close now and I wasn't actually nervous 
about us missing our flight before but now I am
oh my God we're still at the wrong area this 
airport is a little broken up uh there are a  
lot of different possibilities that you can 
fly out of and check into and I'm hoping this  
is the last one it's got to be where we're 
supposed to be series of events it's just  
after 12 and our flight is at 1 30 so that 
gives us 90 minutes to get checked in it's  
the tiny domestic side so it's not going to be 
a problem we made it but we don't have our board
this is unbelievable and I feel like I'm 
getting close to the breaking point but  
they said that our flight had taken off already 
and I don't understand how that can be yesterday  
they told us it was the exact same flight and 
it was at 1 30. so now they're saying that we  
do have that flight at 1 30 but we aren't 
on it that they booked us after the whole  
Fiasco yesterday for an 8 30 a.m flight 
today instead of putting us on the 130  
like they said they were hopely they can get 
us on that 130 flight hopefully there's room  
I needed a minute sometimes things can get 
very stressful and I was starting to give in  
to the stress but you can't do that you have 
got to be persistent with your good attitude  
and keep going because it's gonna work out the 
way it's supposed to I truly believe that it's  
gonna work out the way it's meant to be just how 
it has so far so we're Keeping the Faith okay but
we have to wait and hear she came back to give us 
our passports back and uh she just told us to take  
a seat wait we have an hour till our flight she 
says that they have to coordinate with the daraga  
uh checking counter to see what the issue is 
and to I don't know if they're trying to get  
us on this new flight or not really it wasn't 
clear okay thank you for finding a solution so  
the solution is they're going to send us to Cebu 
to connect to go to chargal I know that Cebu is  
about an hour and a half flight and it's probably 
a really quick jump over to char gown from there  
so it's it's not a terrible solution of course 
there's still a lot of risk here because now we're  
talking about two flights instead of one so if 
this flight happens to be late or have any issues  
we could miss the connecting flight we could 
have a cancellation on the Cebu side I in our  
experience when you're dealing with Philippine 
Airlines and multiple flights there's a lot  
of risk so fingers crossed we're gonna hope for 
the best but we are not out of the woods yet the  
flight they're putting on leaves in eight minutes 
so we're just trying to get our bags on the plane  
I'm not gonna put them on film but I think there 
are like five employees from Philippine Airlines  
working on this right here yeah mistakes happen 
absolutely but it's really great when there are  
people who try to help you out and try to help fix 
the problem let's have a hand for the kids right  
for going through this two days in a row I mean I 
know they love seeing their friends but seriously  
to they are Troopers they are true Road Warriors 
with us and we are so grateful so grateful  
we're getting the personal escort through 
security along with our luggage because  
the flight's literally supposed to 
leave like one minute ago [Music]
so now we're just headed to Cebu but they couldn't 
check our bags all the way through we have to pick  
up our bags when we connect and we also have to 
get our boarding pass for the connection so oh  
my gosh this has been one thing after another and 
we're here in Cebu so far it's going our way now  
forget about a 45 minute layover here 
so we just have to pick up our bags  
go get our tickets go through security rinse 
and repeat that was easy enough boarding is in
and it's so rewarding and challenging at the 
same time but it just goes to show that life is  
going to point you in the right direction and 
when it's challenging just hang in there it's  
worth it you will get through it when you have 
a difficult travel day take it from us the huge  
Silver Lining to this entire experience is that 
we got to spend even more time with our new best  
friends and we were just talking last night about 
how we've been really focused on the importance  
of Brooklyn and Colt being able to find these new 
friends and be able to share similar experiences  
and how that was something that's kind of missing 
from some of our travels but we've realized that  
it's really the same thing for Erin and for me 
at the end of the day there was a little bit of  
a void for us also and being able to connect 
with nelvin and Rocio has been transformative  
for us and we could not be more grateful to have 
made those new friends and we couldn't be more  
grateful to have gotten to spend some extra time 
with them we still got a lot of journeying on this  
trip alone coming up so subscribe and follow us 
along we're finally gonna hit Siargao foreign
Erin, Phil, Reagan, Brooklyn and Colt we're traveling 
the world to experience up close and in person  
all the natural wonders and distinct 
cultures that our kids would otherwise  
be consuming only through textbooks and 
TV we think it's a better way to learn  
and we're working hard to fund this little 
experiment in the hope that our kids will  
grow up wiser Kinder and more grateful for the 
beauty of our diverse planet and its people
come on come on
yeah I'll you're gonna have to cut that 
because I'm gonna give me a transition  
I'm going to do that because I fear for a b or c
not always be changing you can cut that so I 
think it's actually very safe to travel I think  
it's safer to travel with our kids around 
the world than honestly it is where we live  
I'm drinking a lot no no that 
that's a great City to another city
are your elbows tired
a simple jump all right I don't know what the hell  
I'm saying because you're the camera 
is moving and you're laughing yeah
