bigger than you guys?
Small, medium, large

So now, play my intro!"
[lit intro]
-Play my intro!
-What's up my amazing people...
-That's not my intro anymore...

(-Keep dreaming my dreamers)
-"Play my intro!"

And then he does [dink, beomp]
Keep dreaming my sexy beautiful people
[lol he never stops omg]
(laughter) Alright,
SEVENTEEN "Clap" let's get into this, leggo
Teenage Age
I like how there's like 50 guys
True (laughter)
It's like they all use one bathroom and-
This is cute
This is like the clown car where
they all go into the same thing
-Okay that's cute, that's cute
-Aw... that's cute, I like that
I like this concept already
Ah, it's like theatrical
I wonder where they're gonna 
take this beat
It's like slapstick
This is like Tom and Jerry
-Yeah, like 3 Stooges
-Yeah
Yeah, I'm not ready for Jeonghan
-Oh my God
-Jeonghan~
And Woozi...
Oh shit, this is already kind of...
-Whoooo~
-I did not expect that
(more whoo lol)
-Dude they're hot
-Wowwww~
-That's not Jeonghan
-That's so smooth
-The light pink hair!
That wasn't Jeonghan!
[he sounds so defensive haha]
Who was that?
Are you sure?
Yeah!
[it wasn't Jeonghan]
Shh, shh listen
[tell 'em lol]
So swag with the frickin' electric guitar
Dude that's something new there-
There's two that were pink [haired]
The one they showed earlier was the
hot pink
No I was pointing to the light pink though
Oh, I though you were pointing to the hot pink
-Hoshi looks so good!
-Ooh~
-She?
-Hoshi
I don't know their names
Are they speaking in Japanese?
No no no
They're speaking Hangul
I was like damn
You don't even know your own language bro?
They said "ittaeda si"
[sounds like "itadaki"]
"cha cha cha cha"
Oh he winked though
Did he say "how to make a video"?
Yo his voice got deeper what did he eat?
-Okay~
-Yo, they're maturing
uaGH-
He looks so good!
They have so much swag
That's a nice edit
Oh Woozi!
Oh my God
Woozi looks so manly! woOZI~
He always looked manly
What? Just 'cause he's short you 
don't think he looks manly?
-Yo~
-I'm short, I'm manly
-Okay, don't be offended
Yo these edits are fire though
Yeah, look there's like 50 of them now
-Oh, okay
-I like the concept, like the mature...
My God Jeonghan looks so good
He looks SO good
-Ohhh my God
ohHh my GoD
Let's just have a ball fight guys
Yo he's in the front while they're dancing
-I know!
-auGHHHFHH so stressed right now!
He has nice eyebrows man
I wonder where he gets it done
My God his voice is so good
Okay they always do that
[the jump]
They did that last time
(both) "cha cha cha cha"
I really like Woozi with dark hair
I REALLY like it with dark hair
This song is so full
Vernon, I see you
Dude~ those vocals in the background
I don't know if you guys could hear it
"cha cha cha cha"
Are they talking about clap like the
actual "take one"
Oh actually I don't know
-I think that's what it is
-No you're just thinking too much
-No I think it's-
-It's just "ooh, cha cha cha cha"
-Just...
-It's about 'clap'
-It's called "Clap"
They're making a movie in the video
(trying hard to explain)
(keeping it simple)
I honestly wasn't expecting the track
to go like that
You know what I really like about this 
comeback
Because you know how SEVENTEEN
they're still at that stage where like
they're evolving
They look very young, fresh
But at the same time you can tell that
-They're growing
-They're slowly really changing their concept
-And I like this concept
-And you know what's really hot about the intro?
-The electric guitar; towards the ending
-That was dope
-that vocal in the background...
-True
The transitions between each 
member were very clean
Seungkwan's vocals at the end
were just crazy
Hitting those high notes is insane
You can tell whoever's editing the
transitions between everybody's vocals
-That's what I like the most
-It's very clean
It's impressive because...
What, this is second year? 
Two years of SEVENTEEN?
-It's their second album though but it
feels like they're been around longer
It feels like they've been around longer, 
I'm pretty sure they've been around...
2015.. it's almost three years maybe?
But they sound very mature
It looks like they're in like photoshop,
and that's f-cking dope
It looks like he added himself-
(still fanboying about Jeonghan)
I mean, it's Jeonghan, but still..
Hey we're in Korea we can find you guys
like him
No, no one looks as beautiful as Jeonghan
That's true though, he has really
nice eyebrows
That's a sick edit
I was a big, like my bias was Jeonghan,
but I think it's Woozi now
-I don't even think I can pick a bias
-Mine is Jeonghan, and then 2nd is Woozi
then it's Hoshi
(jjag jjag jjag jjag again)
Because Hoshi just... frickin
crushes it
-I don't know who's Hoshi
I wish Mingyu got a little more vocal parts
I feel like he was left out in terms of 
vocal areas
and I really liked his voice in "Trauma"
It's like that husky bass tone
that I thought was really good
But I guess it makes sense for this track
-Who was the rapper in the intro?
-S Coups
I don't have a SVT bias...
His voice sounds so good in this
Yeah, that was S Coups
Are there two different light pink haired?
-Yeah
-Ohhhh
Hey can you add in my mosquito bites?
Out? Or edit them in?
-Edit them in
-Just add them in
Just zoom in
-Because uh-
See like I wanted Mingyu to sing more
Did he sing during that part?
You know what's crazy that I
realized about this comeback?
I never really pay attention to each SVT
member individually
I realized that everybody is a visual
(agreement)
You have that main visual, but everybody
looks like the visual
[is in his own world with Jeonghan]
I'm so shook
Yeah we're gonna find you a Jeonghan
That's everyone's dream
[trueee]
Everyone deserves a Jeonghan in their life
He's not lying
I will fight Form of Therapy for Jeonghan
[:000 there's gonna be a war]
(one clap)
