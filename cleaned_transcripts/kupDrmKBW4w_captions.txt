3, 2, 1. Hey guys I'm Rob, I'm
Justine, I'm Isaiah, I'm Isabelle.
Welcome to our channel we're really
excited to have you here - now the name
behind the channel WE KEEP COMING BACK is from a line from a song called
MANILA we love that song and it goes
something like this so there's a line
there that says we keep coming back to
Manila and we love the line we keep
coming back because Manila is really
where our heart is at me and just seeing
were born in Manila the kids have
visited Manila a couple years ago we had
a blast we want to go back but before
we do we're gonna be going to other
places as well so join us on this
channel as we travel to different places
as a family we'll share with you what we
go through before the trip and during
the trip so hopefully we can inspire you
to travel along with your family make
sure to subscribe to our Channel and
squash that notification bell so that
