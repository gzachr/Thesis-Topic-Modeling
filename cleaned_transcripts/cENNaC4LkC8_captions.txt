killed in the Philippines' drug war.
At first, it was okay with me.
I thought, okay, [President] Duterte’s good.
He’s okay. He’s fixing our country.
But when you’re the one affected…
Sprawled outside the house, the body riddled with bullets.
This is how the victim was found, known as Bonifacio Antonio,
who was drinking just outside his relative’s house when shot.
It’s not easy losing a husband.
It’s hard.
It’s like losing a limb.
At first, I didn’t want to live anymore. But I just thought of our two children.
We were four in the family.
Daddy, Mommy, I have an older brother, and then me.
This is my dad in the picture, “Bonnie” Antonio.
Bonnie was shot in an alley by a group of unidentified masked gunmen.
His family says he wasn’t using or selling drugs and was a victim of mistaken identity.
My only wish is that to those people who say that it’s okay,
I hope what happened to me doesn’t happen to any of you.
No one deserves that kind of treatment no matter how bad you are.
More than 7,000 people have been killed in President Rodrigo Duterte’s anti-drug campaign.
There have been no meaningful police investigations into any of the killings.
