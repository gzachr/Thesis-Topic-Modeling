so for today's video we'll be doing a reaction 
or i'll be doing a reaction to mikey boosters  
filipino mythical features rap so without further 
ado let's hit play so you want to know more about  
filipino mythology huh yes but why do you 
have a british accent no more questions  
it will explain everything
gobbling
magical and powerful
filipinos out there lss is um last song syndrome 
so it's what we say in the philippines when  
a song that you hear is stuck in your head for the 
whole day or for the whole year or whatever but  
great job in the philippines there are mythical 
creatures and i guess like the chorus of it  
the chorus part i guess the part where he talks 
about the thick balance i'm gonna play it again
cause i'm hung like a horse the name 
of this mythical creatures thing
um okay let's let's
like what he said here um it's a thing that 
filipinos know growing up in the philippines  
it's something that you have to be 
careful of when you're walking around  
especially in the rural areas at night especially 
at night in the rural areas you need to  
be respectful of where you're stepping 
and you have to say tabitha people  
or like excuse me so that um the duendes would not 
be offended by you and they wouldn't harm you but  
this these duendes these poonso or these little 
mounds are actually one of the most misunderstood  
mythical creatures or medical beings in in 
philippine cultures in a different filipino  
cultures or different different different 
cultures in the philippines um for one  
we say nuno saponso in tagalog the little nunos 
the little evil dwarves in the ponso which is the  
mound um this is something that the spaniards 
actually flipped and and turned into something  
evil when back then it wasn't especially in in 
kapampang culture so i'm going to be speaking on  
on these things as uh culture bear so from from 
a perspective of a kabampang culture bearer  
that's what i'd be speaking because that's what i 
grew up in the culture that i grew up in tagalog  
but for today um let's start with the mount 
their homes that you should be avoiding at  
night in modern day filipino folklore but 
pre-colonially the poinso or in kapampang  
what we actually called pongsu um were not these 
um evil dwellings of evil spirits or dwarves  
but there was there were actually these um sacred 
tombs the little two mound sacred tombs of our um  
ancestral spirits so when we actually say um what 
we're actually saying is that we're respectfully  
asking for permission to pass or for permission 
to to walk by or to you know to say excuse me  
it's also a way to ask them for pardon for any um 
possible offenses that you might have done while  
passing by the little mounds the little sacred 
punk soul so in a way it's similar to the modern  
day practice of saying tabuta people while asking 
respectfully to pass by um these little mounds  
but the difference is that in the modern day the 
ponzo is the evil dwelling place of evil dwarves  
while pre-colonially the ponzo was the sacred 
tomb that are mimicking them sacred mountain  
that are also home to our ancestral spirits so 
again the ponzo were not the evil dwellings of  
evil dwarves or evil spirits or mischievous beings 
but we're actually the resting place of our nuno  
the nuno is our ancestral spirits so back then 
our ancestors really believed in the power of  
our ancestral spirits and actually um the the word 
puno the word nuno the word ninuno they all have  
the same root word which is the kapampangan 
word nu so what is nu so in kapampangan  
spiritual universe the word new um represents 
these um this how do i explain it it's this um  
this universal force this um universal soul that 
you know permeates everything every living being  
and sustains all life it's something that's 
everywhere around you it's something in you  
but it's also something that you don't 
see but then again it's something that  
you feel how do i explain this so um the 
word new represents this universal force  
which well basically if we think of modern day 
pop culture it's like the force in star wars so  
the word new is representative of that same 
idea of this universal force all around you  
that sustains life that permeates every living 
being and that you know it's everywhere around you  
and it's in you yeah it's basically like the force 
in star wars only um not fictional but more um  
spiritual or and more um intimate more i'm sacred 
especially for you know our our indigenous pompano  
and culture um back then before colonialism 
and even today there are a lot of pockets  
in parliament communities that are still you 
know preserving this this traditions preserving  
these ancient beliefs that you know still follow 
these ancient beliefs so we didn't really lose it  
we just don't see it in the mainstream anymore 
but it's still there so yeah again the word  
new is this universal force um nuno again is our 
ancestral spirit so what the kapon palace believed  
was that once our you know once our ancestors 
our parents grandparents great-great-grandparents  
once all our ancestors once they passed um they 
they're actually you know they reunite with the  
universal new so how does that how do i explain 
that um for one think about traditions you're  
gonna find mythology there's actually a human has 
two souls or two spirits and one of them is the  
new so you have a part of nu in you while you're 
living and then when you pass away that part of  
new inu reunites with the universal new and that's 
why those little mounds are sacred because that's  
where um in a way that's the portal where your 
ancestral news reunites with the universal news so  
nuno is actually our ancestors so contrary to what 
the spaniards had taught us during colonialism  
to be afraid of the nunos to be afraid of the 
ponzo to be afraid of them because they're evil  
little mischievous duendes or dwarves or or elves 
the nunos were actually in reality they were our  
ancestral spirits they were our ancestors they're 
you know they're our roots from where we came from  
and one day we'll be reunited with them too we'll 
be part of it too so that's how um pre-colonial  
indigenous kabul bangladesh traditions were 
around the nuno and the ponzo so yeah there  
you have it one thing that the spaniards flipped 
over and turned into something evil when back  
then these were things that were sacred for our 
people in this song he's he mentioned that you  
know i'm wanting to avoid being cursed by the 
dwindling was if you give them ally which is  
offerings um and actually that's what we do back 
pre-colonial pre-colonial um our culture is to  
really um give offerings to our ancestors actually 
it survived to this day for example in in present  
day in modern day ilocano culture they still have 
this practice of atang sorry if i mispronounce  
it but this culture or the tradition of food 
offerings to the spirit to their ancestral spirits  
and to ward off diseases to ward of evil spirits 
so they still have this this tradition and even in  
kapampangan culture we have this word down and 
daon if you've seen my previous video about it  
many years ago that one is the compound word for 
the day of the dead but the literal translation of  
daoun is actually to offer to make an offer 
to the spirits to our um ancestral spirits  
yeah down is offering a tang is offering and 
these are all modern day or or not modern day  
but these are traditions that have survived that 
have survived from centuries of colonialism that  
we still have today so now let's go back to the 
caprese um let's see what he said in the song
okay so the capra here is depicted as you know 
or the way we see it or the way we know caprese  
today in the philippines as these um mischievous 
evil beings that resides on top of trees that are  
you know smoking cigars drinking all the time 
they've been you know drunk smoking they prey  
on women they prey on on not just women but they 
pray on people and and they're they're not to be  
trusted they're there to be you know you have to 
be frightened of them but pre-colonially these  
capreses were actually what we called and the 
pagod were these tall dark beings that you know  
resided in the in the trees in the forest but they 
were residing there because they're the protectors  
of the forest they're the protectors of the jungle 
they're the protectors the protectors of mother  
earth they're there to protect mother nature 
you should only be frightened of them if you  
harm mother nature if you harm the trees if you're 
harmed any um living being in the jungle and they  
were also believed to be the protectors of the 
indigenous people but they were not something  
that our ancestors were scared of but moreover 
they revered them they respected them they were  
only afraid of them if they did something wrong 
that's why when david fagan was in the philippines  
fighting when he switched sides and joined our 
revolutionary army against uncle sam's army when  
he started protecting the nature or the the people 
the indigenous people in mount araya he earned  
this title of pogo and you can learn learn more 
not learn you can learn more about the mythology  
about the pagod and the capre and david fagan how 
it relates to david fagan in my um old video that  
i made last year now let's go to the next creature 
that he featured which is the thick balancer
these were um similar to what we now know to 
the aztec balance but back then pre-colonially  
that the balance according to kapampangan 
culture in kabul palamytology the tigbalang  
actually has an upper body of um well still human 
upper bodies or human arms human chest human abs  
but with the face of a bird so their head is of a 
bird their body is human but their lower legs are  
horses so yes i'm pre-colonially our ancestors 
were already aware of horses although not  
everywhere but our ancestors were already familiar 
with it and perhaps they were hung like a horse  
but um so yeah that's a thick bala there's 
actually a famous um kapampan folklore about  
that that involved balance one of them is the 
story of tomaring and wikidatu or suleiman and  
the wikidatu and in this epic in this um folklore 
there are two thick balance two twintic balance  
that are that were the guardians of this sacred 
cave full of treasures and they were known as  
the tig balang kuyung or the twin demon guardians 
that kept this sacred cave full of treasures safe  
and you know they were not they were not 
necessarily evil but they were the guardians of  
this cave i guess same with the pugot you should 
only be afraid of them if you're intend to do  
evil if you intend to do harm not necessarily 
monsters that are out there to haunt you  
so yeah that's a thick balance um what's the 
next one yeah let's let's find out the next one
okay
okay so the white lady um white ladies in 
the philippines this mythical scary horror  
um haunting you white ladies in the philippines um  
often times more often than not the stories 
behind these um ghosts that haunts you always  
often involve um sexual assault so a lot 
of them were victims of sexual assault a  
lot of them are victims of rape all of them 
are victims of murder of domestic violence  
so yeah white lady so let's look at the next one 
which is tasirena i like how he thinks this part
okay so serena um is actually a spanish word for 
a mermaid that we use for a mermaid in here the  
scent the way we see serena today is um similar 
to how how mermaids were seen in europe as these  
um you know half um fish half human creatures that 
are not to be trusted that could sing really well  
but not to be trusted and in the philippines um 
apart from having this mermaid in in modern day  
filipino mythical creatures our modern day 
a myth um we have this um shokoy which is  
usually the male counterpart of a serena while 
the citizen is a beautiful half human half fish  
the shokoi is a scary-looking fish-faced human 
body male counterpart but pre-colonially the  
shokoi actually has fruits in frequent philippines 
so in tagalog they're the shokoi in kapampangan  
were mermaid like um beings um that you know half 
human have fish but unlike the mischievous serenas  
unlike the mischievous shokoys um according to 
our indigenous beliefs around the suiki the suiki  
were these water demons they have this power to 
actually ward off diseases they were believed  
to have this this power to prevent diseases 
to prevent people from getting ill to prevent  
illnesses so again they were not necessarily 
mischievous they were not necessarily scary  
but could actually help humans ward off diseases 
help humans ward off illnesses so if you think  
about it we may actually even need the sweeties 
today we need them back to end this pandemic so  
for those who who know it for those who still 
practice the ancient beliefs of the kapampangans  
let's let's find a way to summon the sweekies to 
ward off to end this call with 19 pandemic and the  
next one in his song is the manananggal and as 
i mentioned in my previous videos aswangs were  
effective tools for colonialism in the 
philippines um the priests that the  
missionaries in the philippines used their swanks 
to scare off our ancestors from reverting back to  
our old beliefs and to convert instead to 
christianity so in kapampangan mythology  
or what we have that similar is what is called 
mankukotur and kutud in kapampangan is the root  
word for to cut or to sever so unlike in the 
tagalog malarangal tangal which means to detach  
in kapampangan it's kutud to cut and actually 
madanangar or manko tud are not unique to the  
philippines it's something that we share with our 
saudi's asian neighbors so for example in bali in  
balinese um culture in balinese traditions in 
balinese mythology um they have delay in laos  
they have something similar called kasu and in 
thai they have the krasu these are nocturnal  
spirits doctoral um beings that detaches 
from their lower body um although um they're  
different in different cultures for example 
in the philippines in the madagas they're you  
know all of their upper body detaches from 
their lower body um but in balinese culture
in thai and the casu in in um laos um it's 
something different because for them if i'm not  
mistaken it's only the head that detaches but then 
as the head detach all the um organs like the the  
stomach and other organs are still like you know 
hanging and dangling under their neck um similar  
creatures to what we have in the philippines 
called manananggal in tagalog or mankuku  
again we share a lot with our neighbors where 
we were not isolated we we share a lot before  
colonialism and we still share a lot with 
them today we just need to realize that  
so yeah as you can see there's really a lot 
more that we still need to learn there's a  
lot more that are still left to learn about our 
own culture about our own traditions about our  
own people's beliefs about our own people 
you know there's a lot of things that we  
still don't know even with things like these 
like the swang like the nanga like the kapre
there's still a lot that we still need to 
unlearn and we learn about them these are things  
that we're familiar with today but who knew that 
there are actually deeper deeper mythologies that  
surrounds them and deeper mythologies that you 
know belong to our ancestors belong to our people  
it's our mythology and sadly a lot of our people 
in the philippines and in the diaspora are more  
familiar with western mythologies such as the 
greek gods and goddesses but if you think about it  
our own culture is very rich in mythology and you 
know the the spiritual universe of our ancestors  
were you know really colorful they're really rich 
and in a lot of things we just really need to dig  
deeper and reconnect with our roots we connect 
with our nuno with our new and you know as i  
mentioned in the earlier in the beginning of this 
video a lot of the things that i said today about  
these mythical creatures are actually based from 
my perspective as a historian and as a culture  
bearer from the kabampangan and tagalog people 
so if you want to learn more about um mythology  
and folklore about family history kabampang 
culture or practically anything and everything  
about kapampangan about being a pampangan um 
you should check out aguman sinupunzin sing  
incorporated research institute and center for 
kampala cultural heritage that really safeguards  
a lot of our older beliefs that have been lost in 
the mainstream um narratives so shadow mike tayag
to safeguard our culture to save god 
our heritage for future generations
and for those who have been asking me how do 
you know these things how do you know things  
that i don't know about my own culture well 
for one as a little kid growing up in the  
philippines i listened to a lot of the stories of 
our elders luckily i i am part of a clan that has  
a lot of cultural barriers that kept a lot of the 
traditions alive luckily i had elders who shared  
the stories who passed down the knowledge and i 
really listened to them so my tip for those of  
you who are asking me how do we learn about 
these things is really start from your home  
start talking to your grandparents start talking 
to your parents your great grandparents if they're  
still around you know they have this knowledge 
and just because they're all royal traditions  
it doesn't mean that they're not valid because 
again a lot of our traditions a lot of our  
culture a lot of our history um you know we need 
to get out of this western perspective that has  
to be written all of them are passed down orally 
so we really need to value our oral traditions  
and you know if you really want to learn more 
about it from your own perspective from your own  
families start documenting them start today don't 
wait so yeah um comment down below for any um  
similar mythical creatures similar beliefs 
similar mythologies in your own culture in your  
own traditions in your own ethnic groups um if you 
have something similar or something that i missed  
in this video let us know in the comment below 
i really want to learn from you let's share our  
own knowledge with each other that's why i made 
this video that's why i made this channel to share  
knowledge so yeah um let's share what we know 
in the comments below and you know don't be shy  
um one more thing before i go one more tip about 
learning these things if you want to learn more  
about our pre-culinary beliefs our pre-colonial 
traditions our older traditions and older beliefs  
um you should really check out um the older 
dictionaries that we have you know from the 16th  
hundreds and 1700s all these older dictionaries of 
our languages not just tagalog but like a pampanga  
ilocano visaya all these languages if you find the 
older dictionaries they're basically a treasure  
chest of a lot of terms that you know gives us a 
glimpse of our ancestors belief so a lot of these  
terms have been documented in these dictionaries 
so make sure to look for them if you can find them  
and then no you can start there so yeah i guess
