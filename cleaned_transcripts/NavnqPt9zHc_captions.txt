THEY SPENT MONTHS CAPTIVE IN THE
JUNGLE... HELD BY AN ISLAMIC
TERROR GROUP.
NOW A CAMPBELL COUNTY MOTHER
AND SON ARE TELLING THEIR STORY
TO DATELINE NBC AND WSLS 10.
"KIDNAPPED" AIRS RIGHT HERE
TOMORROW NIGHT AT 10.
EARLIER THIS EVENING... ANGELA
HATCHER TOLD US HOW GERFA AND
KEVIN LUNSMANN WERE CAPTURED.
NOW... HOW THEY GAINED THEIR
FREEDOM.
ANGELA
WHEN WE LEFT OFF... GUNMEN
HAD JUST FORCED GERFA LUNSMANN
TO LEAVE HER 14- YEAR-OLD SON
KEVIN BEHIND.
GERFA LUNSMANN - "THEY PUT A BAG
ON MY HEAD A BLACK BAG SO I
THOUGHT I WAS GOING TO BE
KILLED IN THE OCEAN." ANOTHER
NIGHT JOURNEY... TO
ANOTHER UNFAMILIAR PLACE.
THEY TELL HER TO GET OFF THE
BOAT.
GERFA LUNSMANN - "I SAID I WANT
TO GO BACK I WANT TO BE WITH MY
KEVIN WE'RE GOING TO EAT DINNER
BUT HE'S LIKE GO TO THE
POLICE STATION AND STAY THERE."
GERFA LUNSMANN - "I STOOD THERE
ON THE BRIDGE AS THEY LEFT THE
OCEAN AND DISAPPEARED
INTO THE DARK I KNEW RIGHT THEN
THAT I WOULD NEVER SEE HIM."
GERFA LUNSMANN - "THE LOCALS
DOESN'T SPEAK MY LANGUAGE
TOTALLY DIFFERENT IT'S ANOTHER
DIALECT SO IT WAS
DIFFICULT FOR ME TO ASK FOR HELP
SO I WAS SPEAKING
DIFFERENT DIALECTS TRYING TO
EXPLAIN TO THEM AND THEY
JUST LOOK AT ME SO I JUST WALK
AGAIN AND LOOKING AND
START ASKING FOR POLICE POLICE
FINALLY ONE AND HE TOOK ME TO
THE STATION."
FBI AGENTS ARRIVE A FEW HOURS
LATER AND TELL GERFA
THEY'D BEEN EXPECTING HER. SHE
LEARNS THE CAPTORS WERE
SUPPOSED TO FREE KEVIN TOO.
GERFA NOW GOES FROM MOTHER TO
HOSTAGE NEGOTIATOR... BUT THE
TERRORISTS PUT HER ON THE
PHONE WITH A MAN SHE DID NOT
KNOW FROM HER TIME IN THE
JUNGLE. SHE CAN'T REASON WITH
HIM.
GERFA LUNSMANN - "I WAS TERRIBLE
I WAS AFRAID OF WHAT TO SAY AND
ONE MISTAKE COULD HURT KEVIN.
ALL HE WANTED WAS HIS
MONEY ALL HE WANTED WAS HIS $10
MILLION."
KEVIN LUNSMANN - "IF I WERE TO
GET OUT WOULD SHE EVEN BE
THERE?"
BACK AT THE CAMP, THAT ONE
QUESTION RUNS THROUGH KEVIN'S
MIND OVER AND OVER.
NOT LONG AFTER FREEING HIS
MOTHER, THE TERRORISTS LET
HIS COUSIN GO.
KEVIN LUNSMANN - "I'M ALL BY
MYSELF. THERE'S NO ONE THERE
WITH ME RIGHT NOW I HAVE TO
THINK FOR MYSELF. I HAVE
TO FEND FOR MYSELF. IT'S ALL ON
ME NOW."
"THE MEMORIES OF HOME, OF MY
FATHER OF MY MOTHER AND
EVERYONE KEPT ME GOING. THEY
GAVE ME A REASON TO WANT TO GET
OUT AND WANT TO GO
HOME BECAUSE THESE PEOPLE WERE
WAITING FOR ME AND I WASN'T
GOING TO FAIL THEM IF I WERE TO
DIE TRYING AT LEAST I
TRIED."
THE BOY'S OPPORTUNITY CAME ONE
DAY WHILE WASHING
HIS CLOTHES.
KEVIN SAYS HIS CAPTORS HAD
GOTTEN TOO COMFORTABLE...
HAD STARTED TO TRUST HIM. KEVIN
LUNSMANN - "I WAS LOOKING
OUT AND I CAN SEE NO ONE WALKING
IN THE FIELD OR IN THE
SURROUNDING AREA. IT WAS JUST A
LIGHT BULB MOMENT AND I
REALIZED I WAS MOST LIKELY ALONE
THERE'S BARELY ANYONE
AROUND."
"I HAD KEPT A BACKPACK PREPARED
FOR THIS MOMENT."
"FROM THERE I JUST RAN DOWN THE
HILL AND RAN INTO THE CREEK
AND JUST KEPT RUNNING." "AND
HOUR OR TWO LATER I HEARD SORT
OF LIKE A BIRD CALL LIKE A BIRD
WHISTLE THAT
THEY DO WHEN THEY'RE TRYING TO
COMMUNICATE WITH EACH OTHER
AS SOON AS I HEARD THAT I KNEW
THAT THEY KNEW I WAS GONE."
BUT THEY NEVER CATCH UP.
LATER KEVIN HEARS A MAN CALL OUT
TO HIM.
KEVIN LUNSMANN - "HE HAD A RIFLE
ON HIS BACK AT THE TIME I
THOUGHT THEY FOUND ME AND
THEY'RE TAKING ME BACK. I JUST
TURNED AROUND AND KEPT WALKING.
I JUST KEPT WALKING
FASTER AND FASTER AND HE CAUGHT
UP TO ME AND I WAS ABLE
TO GET A CLOSER LOOK AT HIS GUN
AND IT WASN'T EVEN A REAL
RIFLE."
"HE ASKED OFF THE BAT WERE
YOU KIDNAPPED."
THE MAN GOT KEVIN TO THE
FILIPPINE MILITARY. HIS MOTHER
WAS AT A BASE IN
MANILA.
"I WAS TRYING TO STAY CALM AS I
WAS TALKING TO KEVIN. I KNOW WE
ONLY HAVE LIKE 30 SECONDS. IT'S
NOT A LONG TIME BECAUSE WE WANT
HIM OUT OF THE ISLAND AS
FAST AS POSSIBLE MAKE SURE HE'S
SAFE THE ONLY THING I WANTED
TO KNOW IS IF THEY RELEASED HIM
OR DID HE ESCAPE AND HE'S
LIKE MOM I ESCAPED I DID IT
MYSELF." LAUGHS
KEVIN LEARNS HIS COUSIN IS ALSO
SAFE.
THEN THE REUNION...
AFTER TWO MONTHS APART... HE
DOESN'T RECOGNIZE GERFA
AT FIRST.
KEVIN LUNSMANN - "HER HAIR WAS
MESSED UP I COULD SEE TEARS AS I
GOT CLOSER AND CLOSER I WAS
LIKE I KNOW WHO THAT IS THAT'S
MY
MOTHER
GERFA LUNSMANN - "I WAS CHECKING
ON HIS LEGS HIS ARMS MAKE SURE
THEY'RE ALL INTACT NOTHINGS
MISSING."
AN OCEAN ONCE STOOD BETWEEN
THEM... BUT SHE'D KNOW HER CHILD
ANYWHERE.
