barbacoa one had rice on the other every
Filipinos dream
[Music]
[Music]
hey my name is trans con we are here at
mutt yes the go-to barbecue place here
in Cebu let's go check out what they
have
so here are a different barbecue that
they have here there's usually more
stuff that we barbeque but this is
usually their favorite so I'm gonna go
through them one by one first is we have
the grilled pork belly or the barbecued
pork belly which is what we call the
empo and then we have Teresa which is
our version of pork sausages it's very
sweet
parks barbecue we need that that's one
of my personal favorites and we have
chicken barbecue and always get the
chicken legs
the best and of course we cannot have
barbecue in Cebu without salt which is a
signature here it is open coconut leaf
and rice cooked inside
actually boiled in belief so it gives
off that leafy flavor in the rice
usually they serve this free cotton so
it's open like this as you can see if I
can just grip
the leaf of heart
so barbecues here in the Philippines
usually come with sauces vinegar soy
sauce elements eat
which is
chillie usually I just mix all of these
together but there are really no rules
on how you create your sauce let me show
you how
equal parts
vinegar and
[Music]
see
one or two tiny peppers
and the second one is just minute
along with these two ingredients series
and immensely
add some sealing the booyah
very gently
okay Oh No where do I begin let's start
with
soy sauce
see how easy that is
plates are spoon and heart disease
this I like to use
the vinegar sauce that I dispelled
so you have black part where it's almost
burnt that's where it's nice and crusty
the port barbecue I usually like to have
this alone
barbecue has
naturally
yes to everything I like this one it's
nice and tender it's very meaty it's
very savory and you really taste the
barbecue sauce
and the charcoal which I love
better way to walk down fresh mangoes
Oh incidentally the Silvano's are also
known for the Maine
like Sabu
last but not the least is the chicken
leg usually I like to have it with a soy
[Music]
no so perfectly
great about this places they cook the
food right when you order it so it's all
nice and hot and juicy nothing turns
right I would recommend coming here at
night with your friends because they
have long tables that can accommodate
big groups but it's just a very nice
family place you know it's inexpensive
simple it's very delicious
