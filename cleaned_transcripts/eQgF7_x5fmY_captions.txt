Hello guys it's nice to see you again
and welcome back to Pinoy Planet today
I'm making a nice Filipino dish called
sinigang na isda OK Let,s cook!
I wasn't sure what fish to use today
guys but I have a beautiful piece of
fish here
it's a cod so what fish do you use guys
I'm gonna put a little bit of oil on the
fish and I'm gonna fry it a little bit
So let me know in the comments what kind
of fish you would use for sinigang na isda.
So I'm gonna put it skin side
down to fry it a little bit.
The fish smells really good
it's time to flip it over this dish was
requested by Ask Mary who requested me
to cook a sinigang na isda if you
have any requests for me to do next time
let me know in the comments okay
there we go we're gonna flip over the
fish
okay so I'm gonna add boiling water
we're gonna add about two liters of
water
okay so I will cover this I'm gonna cut
some vegetables yes so again it took a
clean chopping board of course and let
me start you know I was thinking to
start with cutting the vegetables but I
might as well add the sinigang mixture
Mama Sita's already with some patis
which is your favorite sinigang mixture guys I'm using the hot version I
really like the hot version so again I'm
using about half package first to see
how it tastes
last time by the way I made the sinigang
na baboy did you see that I'm also adding some patis this give it some saltiness
time to cut some lovely vegetables guys
how do you call this one in Tagalog I
would like to know it's very tasty we
say in Dutch rettich and this is
eggplant right? Talong we call it
aubergine...
I guess Kangkong is just Kangkong
Pogi is exhausted Pogi say hello to the
viewers so I'm just starting with some
onions Sibuyas in Dutch we call this UI
that's a hard pronunciation for you guys
I try to say it guys
Sibuyas is UI okay guys I chopped
up a few onions
let's add them to the sinigang
finally guys time to add the kangkong I
think when you put this at last let's
chop it up I want to hear from you guys
if I'm doing anything wrong okay so if
my way of cooking sinigang is strange or
missing something don't hesitate to let
me know okay
you guys I think the sinigang na isda is ready so let's do the plating and
tasting by the way did you already see
my Max style chicken fried chicken with
french fries if not yet please
time to taste the sinigang guys some
lovely fish with sinangag
SOUR!
Very sour but nice I think sinigang
supposed to be sour so it is good
