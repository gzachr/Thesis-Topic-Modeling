-Our very posh food, Pig's Ears in Adobo
-Eeeww but Yummy
-Sorry I thought it's for nice dining because of the shirt; it's for street food!
-It looks EEWW but you will surely like this and will make you say UMMMMM
-Mate, have you used cotton buds to clean those ears?
-Of course, and I used Johnsons and Johnsons!
-These are already cleaned. Viewers will say EWW again but these are thoroughly cleaned
-Tokwa't (Tofu) and Fried Pork (mixed with onions, vinegar and soy sauce)
