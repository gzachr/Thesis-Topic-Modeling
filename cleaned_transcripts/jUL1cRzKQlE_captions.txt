good morning
and oh it's raining
oh my goodness look at that sky
good morning and welcome to glamping in Siargao
in the rain
ah still very
beautiful had a fantastic night's sleep
it was so much quieter out here than in
General Luna no chickens no motorbikes
no noisy people anything woke up to the
rain which is a bit of a pain cuz it is
beautiful
but the the biggest problem with this
rain is the road at the moment the road
back to General Luna first four
kilometers it are terrible they are under
construction so it is, yesterday it was muddy,
so this morning I'm going to have
my breakfast because there's no
breakfast provided here  although
thre's a kitchen there's no breakfast
don't have much for breakfast
I've got otap which I'll show you
what that is and water for my luxury
breakfast as I sit on the deck enjoying
the fresh air and the quiet and looking
for a spot of sunshine, hopefully, before we head out for the day
so, my inflatable chair
let's show you otap
ok that's not gonna get
sealed again better eat them all for breakfast
oh, look at them, they are hand wrapped
Oh and more rain coming again
so this is Otap
there you go
now can you hear that rain?!
hmm
good sugary energy
and some nice water
maybe have a nap until
the rain goes
and the rain has stopped at
last thank goodness
now I've got the beautiful view the sun
is trying to break through so it's time
to get out and do some things and as you
can see sweat dripping off me it is hot
and humid and the sun hasn't even come out
yet so my mission is to head into
General Luna get some lunch and then
hopefully the sky will have cleared
we'll have a nice beautiful afternoon
like yesterday because yesterday also it rained in the morning and there was a couple of
beautiful hours in the afternoon before it
clouded over for sunset
so come on let's grab my bags and let's go
this is the nasty bit
uphill, slippery
even the locals are turfing their
passengers off
slowly slowly slowly up the hill
I've done the worst of the road so,
that's quite good
oh thank goodness that is over now back
to good roads most of the roads on the
island up or like this but time to get
back to General Luna get something to
eat and do the last afternoon
just enjoying General Luna and Siargao and Cloud 9 and some surfing
