 
NOW UNITED
Afraid of Letting Go
I get this feelling when I see you like I never had before
 
 
Youâ€™re like a ghost that's always with me
yeah you leave me wanting more
There is something good between you and me
All I want is you
It's so plain to see
 
I can't shake you off
Want you in my dreams
 
No, I  can't get you off my mind
Gotta take a chance
Or we can take it slow
Baby just don't be afraid of letting go
Baby we don't know
Of what the future holds
Baby just don't be afraid of letting go
Don't be afraid of letting go
Don't be afraid of letting go
Baby, there's no need
To analyze when we're
Just having fun
(oh, no)
(oh, no)
I just want to see you reckless
Let me take you on the run
(yeah)
Want you to react
Let yourself unwind
No need to go fast
Just follow the signs
 
We can play it loose
Baby, improvise
I just can't get you off my mind
Gotta take a chance
Or we can take it slow
Baby just don't be
Afraid of letting go
Baby we don't know
Of what the future holds
Baby just don't be
Afraid of letting go
Don't be afraid of letting go
Don't be afraid of letting go
You know I can't explain
So untamed
Flying high on emotion
Let's just take the ride
No need to try
Don't be afraid of this moment
Gotta take a chance
Or we can take it slow (oh, no)
Baby just don't be
Afraid of letting go
Baby we don't know (we don't know)
Of what the future holds
Baby just don't be
Afraid of letting go
Don't be afraid
Don't be afraid of letting go
(oh, no)
yeah, yeah
Don't be afraid of letting go
yeah, yeah, yeah
Don't be afraid of letting go
