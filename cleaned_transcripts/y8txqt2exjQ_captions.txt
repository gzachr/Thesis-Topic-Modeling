hi i'm beryl and today we are doing
another episode in my order for me
series
working title still and the theme for
this week's video
filipino food
i have teamed up with grubhub a food
delivery service and three of my
subscribers ranielle angela marie and
nicole and together we have picked out a
filipino restaurant in my neighborhood
and they have chosen the dishes that
they want me to try
and as a perk grubhub also gave me a
code to give to you guys if you use my
name barrel at checkout you will get
five dollars off an order of 15 or more
so you can also have the filipino feast
that i am about to have because as i
have learned there is a lot more to
filipino food than adobo and halo halo
the food's here
i'm angela marie from eliminates laguna
a small province here in the philippines
my name is nicole and i live in manila
the capital of the philippines my name
is rainier i'm from manila but currently
based in stockholm sweden for breakfast
or what we call agahan in tagalog
i have chosen
dasilob dasilog is an amalgamation of
three words da inc
which is milk fish marinated in vinegar
garlic salt and pepper and then fried we
have the cinnamon
which is our version of fried rice
garlic fried rice
and it log or egg this is actually my
husband's uh favorite breakfast it's uh
highlighted like a lot of our mornings
especially when we got married i will
make this a lot for him for breakfast i
love that there was breakfast on this
menu i think that that is such an
exciting thing to be able to try
breakfast foods and main entrees
this looks pretty good um i did google
what a milk fish looks like it's the
stereotype of what a fish is but it is
pretty interesting because it is a very
old fish dating back to the cretaceous
period so that's cool i really
appreciated also learning about sea logs
because i think that you see them on a
lot of filipino menus and now we know
what it means fried rice garlic fried
rice with the egg
[Music]
oh my god it's so garlicky and good
oh they are not messing around when they
say garlic fried rice
i love it
i'm not sure how to get into the fish
[Music]
come on spoon
you can do it no i used my hands
this is the perfect dasilog bite
[Music]
i know that like pancakes are a popular
breakfast dish but a fried fish with egg
and garlic fried rice is actually
superior so
you heard it here folks even if you
can't find this exact dish when you are
looking to try filipino food look for
the sea logs and just look at whatever
protein they mix in because it is
amazing and i'm very happy that i've
finally gotten to try an authentic
sealog
for the main course i picked out peanut
pinakbet and it's made with different
vegetables like okra bitter gourd string
beans acorn swash and eggplant the main
flavoring for it is
a fermented fish or shrimp base it has a
very
salty
umami like flavor when i was a kid that
was really the only way to get me to eat
vegetables
i will say that the first thing here
that catches my eye is this
bitter
gourd
i am somebody who loves food i love a
lot of dishes bitter gourd i devoted an
entire episode to try to change my mind
because i dislike it oh
it's too bitter
this dish also has the shrimp bagan
which i have also tried before in my
mango episode but i tried it kind of
just plain with green mango but it was
it was a bite
it is very
shrimpy
i'm tasting that shrimpy flavor but it
is
way way better when it's not just
scooped up on a piece of mango made into
this sauce this is actually really nice
i feel like the bitter gourd is like eat
me barrel don't avoid me why are you
avoiding me
because i don't like you
all right here we go
um it's just bitter i just
bitter gourd you just don't do it for me
i'm sorry
take away the bitter gourd this dish is
a winner with the bitter gourd in there
it's still a winner i just have to
pick it out as i eat it
i have chosen menudo
menudo esport
potatoes carrots and bell peppers
cut around the same size and stewed in
tomato sauce i chose this dish because
my mom makes it particularly so well
and it always reminds me of home
whenever i have it here in sweden
menudo when i saw menudo being
recommended i immediately thought of the
puerto rican 1980s boy band with ricky
martin
[Music]
and then i thought about the mexican
soup with tripe and this is neither of
those visually it looks like an american
stew with potatoes and carrots and peas
and meat
oh my god
oh it tastes so much better than an
american stew whoa
the flavor is so
good
i don't i love this i was able to get
calamansi juice i've never had it plain
i've always had it mixed in with
seltzers vitamin c is a citrus fruit
that's very local to us in the
philippines it's
less tangy than limes and lemons and it
has a little sweet undertone into it
oh my god
my cheeks are like puckering ah
[Music]
ooh together that was really nice that
was a
really well balanced bite and sip the
second one is pork vinegar man
it's chunks of pork sauteed in filipino
shrimp base it is savory it's salty
a little pungent it's a definite must
try
we are continuing our pork journey there
is some eggplant in this dish as well so
you know not just straight meat
okay this is really good too
oh it's got like a little bit of
sourness
this is very interesting the dish kind
of starts out like pork and onion
forward and then that fermented fish
shrimp paste kind of comes in from the
back and gives it this very strong umami
taste
that is very good and with the rice
it's really good
[Music]
so good now now i'm like really into
this juice
this dish in particular is a really
great one that was recommended to me
because i don't think that i would have
ever thought to order something like
this just the fact that it had an
ingredient that i tried that i was a
little like oh it's okay
and the fact that it's just pork um i
probably would have chosen something
else but i'm really glad that i tried
this it's so different
[Music]
super yummy super flavorful like this is
coming at your mouth full force bomb
bomb flavor in all the quadrants which
is just an exciting thing to eat you
know it's good i ordered you
is guiness
type of lentil or lung bean that you
could usually with pork dinner dyeing or
any other meat or seafood i chose these
dishes for you to eat because it reminds
me of the summer time you would always
go to swimming in the beach after
swimming we'd always get together and
grill the chicken and they love you
while cooking the ginisan go
so we have a stew and once again i spy
with my little eye
bitter gourd
and this one is harder to see because
it's covered in the mung beans so sneaky
sneaky bitter gourd
i'm tasting that shrimp paste again but
the mung beans are kind of balancing it
out it's got a lightness
with a heaviness
at the same time
[Music]
i need some rice with this stat oh there
are a lot of vegetables working but oh
nope
[Music]
bitter gourd tried to get on my spoon
but i said no
very good with rice it definitely
reminds me of kind of more traditional
lentil stews but it's got this saltiness
to it
makes it more dynamic
that's the word i was looking for
dynamic ron is a spring roll it's like
very similar to let's say a chinese
spring roll but the main difference is
this is a dessert it would be filled
with
slices of plantain bananas and you will
also add jackfruit and it's a deep-fried
dish so before frying you would dip the
doron in a little bit of brown sugar and
then you would deep fry it until it was
crunchy when i was a kid this was one of
my favorite childhood snacks
we got a dessert this time i know in the
episode's past i didn't get a dessert
and people were like hey where's dessert
we got the deep fried turan and i've
made this or at least attempted to make
this in my jackfruit episode these look
way better also way bigger like
hello
whoa
the plantain is so soft inside it's like
a custard
hello
oh my goodness i have some ice cream to
go with it oh god that is the tiniest
bit of ice cream but whatever
[Music]
with ice cream yeah that is uh
that's naughty i mean there's not much
to say this is absolutely delicious if
you like bananas if you like deep fried
things if you like dessert you will like
this i don't i think anybody would like
you don't even have to like any of those
things and you would probably like this
i am stuffed that was super fun i loved
trying so many new foods and exploring
the filipino menu like that i am leaving
everything that i ordered in the
description as well as all of the other
dishes that were recommended so that
when you decide to try filipino food
