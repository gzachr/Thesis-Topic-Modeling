baboy today so we're gonna go to the store and get 
some foreign I learned about a lot of new dishes  
in the Philippines I'm super excited to try all 
the techniques that I learned in the Philippines
we're gonna make it super tasty we'll just flavor 
the pork a little bit with black pepper at asin
Munggo  
beans have been sitting for several hours 
so that should be fine the pan is really  
hot and to add the Mantika you're 
gonna make this baboy super crispy

s it's already getting a little 
bit colder here in the Netherlands  
so these kind of dishes are really delicious 
for the cold weather in the Philippines it  
was so mainit but I love the mainit 
was such a wonderful experience in  
the Philippines today's version has no 
kamatis using a good amount of bawang

make this dish a little bit extra healthy the 
monggo beans are almost boiling we have the baboy  
and this mixture we're gonna put everything 
here together with this one cube of stock  
patis do you add it to the [ __ ] beans right 
away tapos at the end I'm not gonna put it  
yet I'm gonna put it at the end but I like to 
know from you how you're doing it more exciting  
videos coming on Pinoy planet and I want to 
hear from you how you make certain Filipino  
dishes and then and actually then I will 
cook one of your recipes it is a jam to boil  
and I'm already gonna add the pork 
because I want to really get the flavor in
so now the baboy flavor can go into the 
mung beans also the mixture of sibuyas
where's the kaning is here
the texture is already good with the 
beans so now I'm gonna add the patis
