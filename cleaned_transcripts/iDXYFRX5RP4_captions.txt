thank you good morning everyone we're Nicole
and Mico welcome back to our discovering the
Philippines Series in our last video we were
exploring Manila with Nicole's parents and
getting their first impressions of the Philippines
since then we headed to the airport and hopped
on a short flight to one of the most beautiful
destinations here in the Philippines Palawan
Palawan is one of the top
so in today's video we are going to show you
guys what a day in like our life hanging out
here in Palawan is like taking on a snorkel
tour around the place we've been staying and
just enjoy the incredible beauty of blowing
[Music] so while we were doing an intro the
man came back with all the toilet paper we
requested so I guess it looks a little funny
walking around with toilet paper it's not
just for us though it's for the whole family
the whole family okay just need a small restock
but to give you a little background of where
we are right now Palawan is a large island
Province and kind of the central western part
of the Philippines and we are on the Northern
island called coron we are the top top end
of the island where it is really secluded
so there's not much around us except for this
beautiful Airbnb Welcome to our space okay
so I'll show you first by Jonathan cooking
us all bracky you guys remember dad from the
last episode okay here's quickly the dining
room air conditionings which are blowing on
my head which is so nice A little living room
I'll show you the balcony back there in a
second but here is the first bedroom usually
there's nice views out here but it gets really
steamy when we sleep in here at night and
then a
washer one of two washrooms in here they've
got this like long Corridor look at that of
all of these cabinets it's so nice actually
and then this is the master bedroom which
of course my parents are using because you
know seniority and all that they've also got
a nice pool washroom here and then their room
actually leads out to the balcony you can
access this from another spot as well but
I love that from their room you can like just
go through these balcony doors they just open
them up in the morning and make it these incredible
views we've been hanging out here for the
last couple of days and just really enjoying
time with my parents hanging by the pool which
we'll also show you when we head down to catch
our boat for snorkeling in a few minutes which
is going to pick us up literally on our on
our beach right here we're feeling very spoiled
today
silicone fam are just getting ready but I
figured I'd give you a little bit of a tour
outside the property so it's actually really
really big it's a big white building it seems
to stand out from the surrounding area of
so much Greenery and beautiful beach around
us but you have a beautiful park over there
there's a nice bar area here yeah it'd be
perfect for parties but there's not really
enough rooms in the building to host that
many people but like this would be an ultimate
party place because yeah look at this pool
massive pool it is so beautiful it's uh so
clean and pristine and blue and then at night
too the pool just lights up with beautiful
blue LEDs it's so gorgeous and then yeah there's
the building up behind me right there so we
have a corner unit of the building on that
second floor there are other units I think
one maybe two units that make up the rest
of the building um but so far nobody's staying
there so we've had this place basic to ourselves
for the past few days and it's just been so
magical because uh yeah for four or five people
with this giant pool yeah it feels very very
nice it's also an infinity pool so you can
look over the edge and see the beautiful beach
are you ready to go yeah oh it's time to go
[Music]
that is a really cool way to see the water
it's so open and you have like a 360 view
of everything yeah you're right that's kind
of cool it's actually never seen a bowl like
this this is actually really cool I think
Thailand has similar boats but they're very
long and they're not covered but I like these
boats very chill very tropical feeling so
this deer see here shallow for like 200 meters
off the shore and then there's a heat drop
like this big shelf which is right here which
looks very scary and like the watercolor totally
changes because now it's very deep I think
it's how deep is this like 12 meters deep
or something like that all of a sudden it
just drops 12 meters it was really cool
scary [Music]
if you guys have been watching this Philippine
series for a little while now you know that
I'm a Filipino I was born in the Philippines
but I was raised in Canada so I don't really
know too too much about the Philippines I've
never been to Palawan but somehow I just feel
so happy and proud to take Nicole and her
family here to show them just such beautiful
beaches and Waters and such a beautiful part
of the Philippines I feel like I'm touring
them around to a place that I know very well
but I really don't know it I just feel like
I have this connection to this area [Music]
thank you
[Music] oh my God it is so beautiful welcome
to the first island of the day
[Music] thank you [Music] very much
wow Paradise
wow yeah I feel like I'm in a postcard that's
the good way to put it
all right the parents are in they say it's
really actually deep they're already Kent
I mean mom's only like four foot nine but
she already can't touch I thought we were
at Paradise waking up this morning but uh
I have to redefine that now I feel like this
is incredibly so beautiful Paradise Paradise
Paradise I just can't believe it because I
I know that the Philippines uh has been known
to be one of like the most picturesque most
beautiful postcard worthy beautiful beach
destinations and um it's one thing to like
see in a postcard it's another to actually
be here this is so gorgeous and the sand oh
my God it's like powder anyway we're in heaven
yeah but I'm so hot I want to get in the water
okay let's go thank you [Music]
oh my God [Music]
how's the personally been here so everything's
cool the thing is is I'm having a very difficult
time holding the camera but it's cool there's
a lot to look at there's tons of Quorum although
it looks the same color because the Samsung
has a bit okay so I really feel like we undersold
that to begin with because it turns out we
just had to go deeper than we were originally
but as soon as we got there the insta died
so you didn't get to see any of that footage
turns out this is an amazing snorkel spot
it got way clear and we got further out and
then there was no like coral on the bottom
so you're actually able to really properly
swim always beautiful like just I wish I had
footage for you I'm sorry but it was stunning
yeah that was insanely beautiful I wish we
had the camera to show you but like the fish
there the coral I felt like we could probably
stay here another few hours to really explore
the different pockets of a beautiful Reef
out there we just discovered it so late like
I think we're just like we're still too shallow
for too long yeah and then I was like oh my
God what is this there's more okay but we
are getting back on the boat because we have
another Island to discover
[Music]
oh
my God
crazy this is wild like the water is sober
I think this is really cool too because it's
like the Rocks it's called Block Island so
we've got the rock just like coming straight
out of the sea and then just this beautiful
little pristine Pita bit of Beach and I believe
this is here I can't believe this exists just
like normally all over the world crazy looks
fake like I actually I honestly keep looking
at it thinking like does someone like filter
my eyeballs like one problem and it feels
fake just the latest augmented reality filter
where's filters your brain from seeing what's
actually real like if they like dry sunglasses
on and like destroying the color or something
but I forgot my sunglasses so I don't have
them it's wild so beautiful here so we're
on the next Island we're not jumping into
the water quite yet because uh we're still
resting a little bit grabbing some food Nicole's
got uh what is that fun Philippines mangoes
from Philippines which is just so cool this
is actually my first one I'm not doing it
what a more uh there's not a more Fitting
Place I don't think look at that Filipino
way yeah I gotta cut the Filipino way Amigo
time made a cup mangoes this way I think maybe
on our honeymoon like eight years ago and
I'm never going back look at that yeah isn't
this clever oh my God it's so good it's heaven
it's really tiny over there no there's the
big one you're missing the big one yeah see
they're right behind the little oh yeah the
guy was saying that this island Black Island
also has a small cave system in it and uh
we are actually able to just walk around the
inside of these caves and check them out
wow cooler in here this is cool it smells
like um it smells familiar like a part of
the zoo like a section of the animals in the
zoo smells like that in here it smells like
a locker room no it's like really musty in
here this is cool [Music]
so apparently you can swim in this stagnant
pool and I think Nicole's gonna jump in I'm
holding a camera
hmm so Nicole and I are now in the water Mom
and Daddy coming in and uh that's a resounding
level the chicken's over there what's freaking
me out is I can't see if this is the end or
not oh I think that is the end I don't know
I can't tell our kids Brave dad got in
it's actually really nice in here
yeah okay so I think the coolest thing about
this is that the front of it to me looks like
the front of like like I feel like I'm looking
up to a dragon's mouth I don't know if that's
a great View but I don't know to me I feel
like I'm inside the dragon's mouth and I'm
like seeing through his mouth it's pretty
cool [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause]
[Music] [Applause] [Music]
well how's your guys snorkeling fun that was
amazing salty and good salty we're gonna stay
all day but at some point you gotta call it
quick that was an amazing amazing historical
Adventure I can't believe this island is here
every day looking the way it does it's so
beautiful you got to come here that's a very
cool place that was amazing [Music] [Applause]
okay we are back we are absolutely wiped although
part of me wants to jump into the pool I would
love to have something fair enough fresh fresh
water or a nap or a nap one of those or a
nap in the pool I think this is an awesome
introduction to Palawan though did I say that
right I think so I hope we're saying that
right I'm trying so hard to say it the way
that Miko says it which is the Filipino way
we're trying to get used to the Filipino way
I think that's correct we've had a great day
