And by the way,
it's like, I hate talking
about this, but it's happening
outside.
They're killing Black people
outside.
They're killing Asians.
They're killing white people
in movies and I hate that.
And my cousin's so stupid.
She's like, "you know what?
"Don't worry, Ron.
"We're safe.
"We're not Chinese.
"We're Filipino."
I'm like, are you crazy?
You think the racists know
the difference between Chinese
and Filipino?
Do you know the difference
between Chinese and Filipino
to a racist?
It's a difference between a Honda
Civic and a tinted Honda Civic.
(audience laughing)
Looks a little darker but 
more stylish.
That's it!
(audience laughing)
Filipinos were not even full Asian,
and the government didn't know
we were.
They just put us
in an Asian category.
We're actually mixed.
We're half Asian and half Latino.
When my parents came to Canada,
they had to fill out a form
for the government
to choose what race they were.
They had to checkmark white, Black,
Latino, Asian, and Middle Eastern.
We checkmarked Asian and then
Latino, have two lines drawn to one,
and then write Filipino.
Those two are half Asian and half
Latino.
So what happened was back 
in the day in the 1500s,
Spain went to Philippines,
made love to everybody,
and then left us.
(audience laughing)
He's like, "where's your dad?"
On those boats.
"Where are they going?"
To the Caribbean.
Why?
"To make Cubans now."
(audience laughing)
That joke never works in Miami
by the way.
(audience laughing)
My parents taught me English.
It was kind of weird because they
had the Filipino accents.
So I grew up with an accent.
You know how messed up that was?
I had a Filipino accent growing up,
but I wasn't born
in the Philippines.
I didn't know how to speak Filipino
either.
I just had a Filipino accent
as a kid.
The teachers like said, 
"where are you from?"
Canada.
(audience laughing)
"Are you sure?"
Positive.
(audience laughing)
"You can't speak any Filipino?"
Not at all.
"This kid's a North Korean spy,
"for sure."
(audience laughing)
I remember the report card read,
Ron has a problem, pronouncing
his Fs and Ps and Vs and Bs.
He pronounces friends as priends.
My dad's like, "why do you pronounce
"priends as priends?
"Who taught that to you?
"You have a preaking froblem.
"You know that?"
(audience laughing)
I'm big for a Filipino, too.
My dad isn't even five feet tall.
He keeps looking at me like
I'm a monster.
Look how big you are.
(audience laughing)
Look at my creation.
(audience laughing)
Like Frankenstein.
(audience laughing)
They love seafood.
They love fish, tilapia,
red snapper.
My dad's favorite fish is called
milkfish.
It's from the Philippines.
There's a million bones in the fish,
and he can't get enough of it.
Here's my dad every Sunday morning.
"Number one fish
"from the Philippines, milkfish,
"number one.
(audience laughing)
(gagging)
"Call the doctor."
(gagging)
The cat looked at him like,
(cat hissing)
"call the doctors."
(gagging)
We have delicacy-- any Filipinos
here make some noise?
OK.
(audience laughing)
You're not Filipino right here?
No?
You?
No?
Just say you are.
Anyways, you make me feel
comfortable.
(audience laughing)
We have delicacies in our community.
Every culture is a delicacy, 
which means it's gross.
That's why they call it a delicacy.
You have to be
delicate to the situation.
That's like having an ugly child.
You can't call the child ugly.
You have to call it smart.
You know, it's--
He's a genius.
He'll be fine.
Look away.
(audience laughing)
Filipinos has this one delicacy
called balut.
(groaning)
Wait, you guys know this?
Do you have Filipinos
in your basement?
What's going on?
(audience laughing)
If you don't know,
it's a duck embryo.
Relax.
I'm not selling them to you
after the shows,
(audience laughing)
I'll sign your balut.
(audience laughing)
To explain the first week
is the embryo, the yoke,
the fourth week is the bird.
It's right smack dab in the middle.
I don't know how Filipinos eat this.
We couldn't wait for the process
to end.
Could they pull the plug out.
I'm hungry over here.
I saw this on that TV
show Fear Factor.
Remember that Joe Rogan show?
This guy wouldn't eat balut
for $50,000.
My dad was like, "that's bullcrap.
"I have two in my pocket right now.
"50,000, very easy."
(gagging)
(audience laughing)
My dad used to sell these baluts
to the Filipino community in Toronto
back in the '80s.
When I was six years old,
I was a prankster.
What I would do, take a cook balut
come home, bring it to school,
put it under a tree,
take the balut halfway out to make
it look like it fell from the nest.
I know.
I was a messed up kid.
I went to therapy for this.
But anyways, and the kids
would gather.
Oh my gosh, there's a baby bird that
fell from the tree.
That's so sad.
I walk in, "how much
"would you pay me to eat it?"
(audience laughing)
I made $100 at six years old.
I was a diabolical genius.
The principal called my dad, 
"Mr. Josol, your son's 
"eating dead birds
"falling from trees."
Are you stupid?
"No, no."
That was a scam.
They made $100 with one balut.
And I take you, bring it
in our school, and you can do it
again.
You're a genius.
Look at my creation.
