hello!
we arrived in Coron
after 4 and a half hours wit a ferry boat from El Nido
we arrived in the hotel room
so let's do a room tour
this is a lobby hallway
and in the righ, the bathroom
the bath room is immense
we missed this in El Nido, a bath tub and a shower space
what a big mirror
if we were five of us it could fit us
five smaller ones :)
how is our hotel called?
Coron Gateway
so, this is the big bath tub
this is the shower
aaand...
hello dears, i'm back
it is a similar situation like in Puerto Princessa, the link is here
this ia pain made by a local artist
or from ikea store
or from the night market near by
a big screen tv - sintax
and
because the room is big, i don't know it i will see the tv
this ia a relaxing sofa for night time
feels so good
and after this 4 four boat ride is awesome
with that pink wall this place is instagramable
i am so tired
i think this is the biggest room we got in this time in Asia
for this, we like Coron
when you book a hotel we recommend you to check the place on their website not only agoda or booking
when we booked, the hotel on Agoda had 4 stars
and here we found out that has only 3
this is not any problem, the room looks like in the pictures
but this is uncomfortable for some people knowing that you booked something and here is something else
the hotel is Coron Gateway, but is not a 4 star hotel as Agoda says
safety box, AC, big terrace, big bath tub and a big bed in a big room, all of this thing i like :)
what i like in every single hotel room to have
because i have a lot of gadgets to charge, a lot of power outlets
hete in the Philippines i need also an adaptor
but, about this in a future episode about gadgets :)
this was our "van"
for the five of us :)
hello and welcome to a new episode of our Travel n2 vlog
my name is Valentin
my name is Mihaela
and today we are in Coron with a new tour - The Ultimate Tour
with 6 or seven stops
and this is the first spot - Twin Lagoon
we don't know yet the place
because we have to swim to the other place
here is the first place, swim to the other and then get back to the boat :)
and because i am not a good swimmer i think i will stay here on the boat
here you are allowed only with life jacket
so, that's that
ether way i'm not a good swimmer also, so let's go
i'm in the water
it is uncomfortable to swim with the life jacket
but you are not allowed without
this is so beautiful
i am at a conjunction :)
some climb the stairs and the rest under the rocks
i'll go under the rocks also
this is so small and they have a kayak :)
so interesting
wow, so wonderful
and i'm out in the other part
hi there, Catalin!
and now the gopro lens is wet :)
i was careful until now :)
and now the lens is wet
and i am here, wow, this is so beautiful
that was the part with the stairs but i went under
this is so weird under my neck and i talk like Mickey Mouse :)
what a view
and the water is hot
yes but why? think about it (Miruna)
now i get it :))
this is the first snorkel place
hello
i don't know if i'll use this mask
let's see the coral riff
this is Sunset Beach
this is the third stop, i think
we did a lot of snorkeling today :)
we forgot how many
stop here, stop there :)
i like more to visit islands or different beaches
with some green areas, small beach, to eat something
we had to many snorkeling stops, from my point of view
and also we have the lake... kaya...
another swimming place - Kayangan Lake
on a lot of beaches are people that sell perls
a lot of people like this
not as many as in the main touristic places but still
it is bad that we are on Sunset Beach but not at  sunset
or at the sunrise
at sunrise on Sunset Beach :)
this is a small beach
400-500 meters long
at this time here are 4 boats
and for now is a chilled beach
how long is to get there?
about 1000 stairs :))
still climbing
we climbed 163 stairs
now we're descending 250
let's see when we'll have to climb 250 and descend for 163 :))
and i am still here i didn't quit
i am ready to discover Kayangan lake
like Caciulata (Romania)
lots of people here, this is a busy place
our tour guide said that now it should be empty
or less people here, at this hour
how is the water?
superb
feels like a dream :)
it is hot?
yes
and te water is fresh, not salty
how are you, how is the water?
i like it so much
aahhh i have a cramp
cramp-cramp
from pleasure
i think is from this fresh water
i have burns (George)
this is so good
finally some relaxation time
this life vest is so uncomfortable
i have a difficult breathing
we are not allowed without life vest
but, why?
they are getting you out?
they are getting you out of the lake
really?
i heard someone whisteling
after we climbed that many stairs? :))
swimming to the middle of the lake
i have cramps
from pleasure in vacation :))
my feet hurt
we told you that we got swimming shoes?
mine have two cat eyes
mine are blue :))
approaching the middle of the lake
and i arrived
here is so beautiful
to see the  entire place
and be amazed by the nature beauty
and the water is fresh and you don't feel the salt on your skin
and feels like a shower after the whole day of snorkeling
really nice
this lake is 8 meters deep
not that deep :)
the best thing today
just like this
"this is awesome " (Catalin)
"i like it so much" (George)
"it's like a party" (George)
