Friends, if you will watch this video
you will never
be able to live as before anymore
Today I'm gonna destroy
the illusion that women
are the 'weaker' gender
We have to go to Moscow soon
and I decided to check
if our wheels
are well balanced
In order to do it
we need to find
good tire fitting shop
and working clothes
okay, let's go!
damn, we have to buy a tank
This is Russia!
*Guess which state :D *
Bad roads damage wheels
Bad wheels are dangerous
and safety
- is the most important
Ow! Here we are
a good tire fitting shop
Well
I found a good tire fitting shop
and working clothes
let's get started!
You will not believe this
but to balance wheels
we need to remove them
So
take the jacks
put it here
well, very heavy
but i am a strong woman
Oh
Yes
here
a little bit
look, I'm strong
woman
now remove the wheel
heavy
one
two
oh I can count, guys
first wheel
dirty
i don't like dirt
need to wash it
let's go
ninety
now we need to do the next wheel
oh, dinner is ready
* I think only about food *
like an oven
* I hope you are not as bored as me :( *
before checking if the
the wheels are balanced
their working surface
need to be clean
it's here
Unfortunately, this is a secret technology
therefore I will only show the result
so now put the wheel
to balancing machine
first remove the weights
alright
* measure the wheel parameters *
okay, look here is 25g
need to look for 25g weights too
alright
25
and put here
here it's 15g
need to look for 15g weights too
alright
15
and... here
Oh
* wheel balanced *
* applause *
That's it!
and lastly:
put the wheels in place
need to clean the hub
This is copper grease
it's needed so surface
wil not oxidize
and also it will be easier to remove the wheels
better wheel - in front, worse wheel - at the back
this is better, this will be in front
I can't
now the jacks can be removed
now, we need a special key
that's all!
it's actually harder than it seems
remember!
if your tire installer
does not perform one of these operations
highly likely he's not a very good master
maybe in your city
there's no good master at all
then you are out of luck
good balanced wheels are very important
if the wheels are poorly balanced
then your friends or family may get into accident
and that's not so cool!
therefore, if you love your loved ones
be sure to share this video with them
feel free to post it in your timeline
or even send in private messages
take care!
In general, I am a jack of all trades!
if you want me to
tell you about something
like this - about tire fitting
do not be shy!
ask about it in the comments!
I love you all!
so if you love me too
then be sure to like this video

because I tried hard
to make it for you
thank you all!  bye!
Oh! Why is it moving?
