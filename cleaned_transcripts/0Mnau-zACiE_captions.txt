the four of us arrived in Manila late last night 
and after a travel day of uncertainty that was  
caused by a powerful typhoon sweeping through 
the northern Philippines the previous evening we  
weren't sure we were going to make it into town at 
all but now that we're here we're ready to explore  
the city's sights and bites today we're going to 
sample the top street food in the oldest Chinatown  
in the world track down some authentic Filipino 
food swing by the largest mall on the continent  
of Asia and see what our sprawling Bayfront Hotel 
has to offer in between let's start devouring  
it's about time to head out so we're gonna 
grab our bags head downstairs catch a taxi  
to the airport and see if everything works out 
in our favor got about a 25 minute drive to the  
airport from the heart of town here Monday 
midday 11 A.M so as far as traffic [Music]  
we're on scoot air
Health declaration form and make sure that our 
flight's on time hello there's an issue with  
Brooklyn's passport for some reason so we have to 
go to the counter I hope it all works out Brooklyn  
do the particular problem with your passport we 
found out the problem I guess when we purchased  
the tickets uh the kids were purchased as adults 
and they have to be specified as children when  
you purchase the tickets so we got to get that 
fixed and then we'll be on our way all fixed and  
our flight is on time that is just crazy we are 
narrowly missing a typhoon as we find in Manila  
but we are going to go through security get some 
food before a flight even outside of Jewel it's  
a really nice airport here we've got Fendi shop 
we've got Gucci Burberry coach Hugo Boss Salvatore  
Ferragamo some good shopping right here it's 
interesting and something we haven't seen yet  
we're actually going to go through security 
at the gate to get to our gate well this is  
the first time we've flown anything outside of 
United or the Star Alliance in about two years  
maybe longer yeah and it feels weird yeah and 
it looks like it's a full flight so we're not  
the only ones heading to Manila and nobody seems 
to be worried about the typhoon that just rolled  
right through they just made an announcement 
that the flight is delayed but nothing to do  
with weather cabin's just not ready yet well 
we're finally boarding so this might actually  
happen definitely over three hours late because we 
were supposed to take off three hours ago and they  
just started boarding so I think we're probably 
not going to get in until close to 10 p.m and we  
are jet lagged from flying out to Asia some of us 
are lucky enough to catch some z's on this plane  
at least we get some dinner which is great 
because then we can go straight to bed when  
we get to the hotel and it's not bad and 
it gets better than the U.S flight Foods  
we've just landed in Manila and frankly I 
think it's pretty amazing 24 hours ago there  
was a powerful typhoon crossing over the city 
and here we are tonight actually landing here  
so that we don't have any disruption to our 
trip I think it's pretty incredible My eyes 
feel like they're so puffy and heavy they're 
so weighed down it's really hard to open my eyes
so transportation arrange by the hotel is 
only $54. I found that a lot of the food  
and transportation in the Philippines 
is really affordable so that's a plus  
and welcome to Manila hey since we booked 
with inspirato we have free breakfast each  
morning a hundred dollars Resort credit 
oh and we're on the executive level so  
that has its own separate breakfast included 
uh afternoon tea cocktails with the chef and  
uh complimentary use of the meeting room now 
let's go to the room I cannot wait to go to bed
oh wow all right we'll give you a full tour of 
this place tomorrow but we're gonna hit the sack  
because we are absolutely drained and we've got 
15 more days of the Philippines and we're going  
to be taking you along for the entire ride daily 
vlogging most likely so please subscribe if you  
haven't already and follow us along we've got some 
amazing adventures planned over the next two weeks  
good morning we are ready for our first day in 
Manila so we gotta get up we gotta explore the  
hotel a little bit and then we are going to head 
into the oldest Chinatown in the world and we're  
gonna devour it so first let's head downstairs 
and devour some breakfast thank you though [Music]  
well I love this that we booked with inspirato 
uh it puts us in the executive Lounge area so we  
have an omelette station a really great breakfast 
top breakfast and a beautiful view and we can see  
how cool the pool is down here too all right 
that's very satisfying I'm gonna head back to  
the room these kids have to do some school and 
then we're gonna begin the day's festivities it  
is so beautiful to see this lobby in the daylight 
the views of the ocean and then over here is the  
swimming pool but we are trying to find the ATM 
so that we can get some cash before we go and  
do a food crawl we're gonna head into the bonando 
neighborhood and there are two things that people  
really made us aware of when we said we were gonna 
go to Manila and that's that the traffic is really  
bad and that also theft is an issue so we're gonna 
keep our belongings and our children very close by  
I'm finding it very interesting that when you pull 
into the carport here for the hotel and it's an  
upscale Hotel they have security and Security even 
has the little mirrors on wheels things that they  
roll under the car to check for explosives and 
stuff and then even when we showed up last night  
going through it's like airport security with 
the the metal detector and the conveyor belt and  
everything so that's I mean it's interesting 
and probably a little bit disconcerting when  
you think about it I'd love to get a story 
about how necessary all of that is and why
we just got dropped off at the bonando church and 
we're gonna head deep into Chinatown here it's  
where people go when they come to Manila and they 
are looking for a culinary and cultural adventure  
just like we are first up is sincerity Cafe and 
Restaurant where we're gonna get one of their  
fried chicken dishes we've gone back and forth 
on hiring professional guides whenever we go  
into new cities be hit or miss and luckily we've 
had really good luck when it comes to the guides  
that we've used in our episodes but some of the 
risks are sometimes that like take you to all the  
tourist traps sometimes they take you to places 
that offer them kickbacks so unless you want to  
go to a bunch of jewelry shops and nothing off 
the beaten path I mean if that's your thing fine  
but otherwise I think it's a really smart idea 
to always try to ask for a sample itinerary in  
advance make sure that the places are going to be 
local and authentic if that's what you're after  
and make sure that they're not trying to pat 
it with some of their friends businesses but  
it's also an additional layer of complexity 
when we try to use guides for filming a lot  
of times because they want to really control the 
whole situation and we need more freedom in this  
particular instance we're just kind of going with 
the flow Erin did our research and just exploring  
and seeing where it takes us this is supposed to 
be the best Chinese style fried chicken in town
absolutely that's really good and it's in 
the batter the batter has some flavor to it  
this batter is delicious there is some sort of 
seasoning or flavoring in here that's making it  
really distinct and different different than what 
I expected definitely look how juicy yeah that  
is good I'm not the world's biggest Fried Chicken 
guy but I could get used to this nothing but skin  
what am I tasting right now yeah Colt says maybe 
there's a little lime in the batter it would be so  
I tried I asked what seasoning they used in this 
batter but they can't tell us it's a secret recipe  
gonna stay a secret it doesn't look like we're 
doing a very good job of pacing ourselves today  
we've got like 12 places to go this is such a cool 
little street here that is it looks like a small  
market and a narrow street uh but we're at new 
Pang nupo hang lumpia house and uh we're gonna  
get lumpia I don't know what it is so we're gonna 
find out in just a minute this is just this little  
tiny stand here but it's got all these articles 
that they've been featured in can we get one  
what is a lumpia a spring roll okay let's do one 
lumpia yes I love spring roll all right let's see
is this soy sauce whoa look at that this 
looks awesome and this outer layer is soft  
it's not crispy at all so it's not 
deep fried see what it tastes like  
that is delicious this like it's like a crepe 
on the outside and it has a little sweetness  
to it which gives it amazing flavor and I 
can't really tell if this is tofu or chicken  
but I think it's tofu so many vegetables in 
there this is really good Brooklyn wanna try  
a bite of this spring roll all right then you're 
missing out I feel like I taste sweet corn  
but I don't see any sweet corn but maybe it's just 
an association with really fresh summer vegetables  
because that's precisely what it tastes like 
phenomenal it's streets like these and bites  
like that that really makes me love eating food 
and experiencing culture through the food that  
was a really good bite and now we're gonna go 
find a bakery I bet you the kids are gonna want  
something there Ho-land hapia and bakery and I 
want to point out masks are required so many places  
in the Philippines still this is September 
late September of 2022. we'll take Donuts
so this is a sweet pastry it's kind of like 
donuts without a hole wow here Brooklyn's gonna  
try it first yeah it's got filling it's sweet it's 
kind of like a croissant filled with like cake  
with sesame seeds and unless there's a language 
barrier and I didn't understand it right it's  
made with pork lard yeah I heard the same thing 
that is sweet like a creamy sweet very subtle  
flavors I would say it has a little similarity 
to shortbread good yeah approved this is yummy  
it's like shortbread because it's very very dry 
it tastes like it but very dry you need a glass  
of milk or water all right let's see what's next 
uh anybody in the mood for seafood it might be a  
little crowded so maybe we go to dumplings 
a little bit of an indication of what we're gonna 
eat also soy sauce another indication no it's not  
gonna be Sushi it's going to be dumplings ooh 
this looks good here's what I'm gonna do I'm  
gonna bite a little corner off and now put it 
down there oh God this is a real balancing act   
thank you Brooklyn these are pork 
dumplings she said it was their best seller
yeah it has like a lime it was like pork lime 
flavored inside that's really delicious I love  
it this is a phenomenal list we have 
so far so if you're coming to Manila  
follow this little guide these are great 
bites so good babe you've got to try this  
interesting you think lime huh there's so much 
green in there look I don't think it's lime I  
think it's from the greens I think it's something 
like collard greens or something that has a bit  
of tang wow okay what's next it's so hot and 
humid here we've got to find something cool to  
get away from all of these really hot dishes so 
I'm on a mission either find some ice cream or  
some popsicles or at least some cold fruit Yahtzee 
hello can we get one Oreo one mango and one melon
it tastes like mango with graham crackers all 
right this one is filled but just to be clear Colt  
did order a mango graham cracker it's cantalope 
melon not watermelon very refreshing that's
interesting when we ordered they asked us to 
tell them how sour we wanted we said regular  
oh yeah it does have that little bit of sourness 
which is kind of like a natural yogurt how how  
that's sour yours is really good Colt Colts 
is super good yours it literally tastes like  
you're drinking a cantalope well that was 
a well needed cool down but I think everyone  
else needs more of a cool down so we're gonna go 
back to the hotel and check out the pool thank you  
the sun has gone down since we were outside 
walking in it but it's still a beautiful view  
and a great place to hang out this is probably 
the first time since we started off on this trip  
to Southeast Asia that we've actually sat down 
and relaxed and did a little bit of nothing so  
I'm gonna savor this moment until we go back 
to adventuring again well 10 minutes all 10  
minutes what's up beanie starfish we didn't get 
to everything that we wanted to get to downtown  
today uh and I think largely because it was hot 
and humid and it's just becoming increasingly  
difficult to do that actually this is the closest 
we've ever been to the Equator so that explains a  
lot of why it's so hot and the Philippines tends 
to have warm weather all year round because of  
its proximity to the equator but this is the hot 
and rainy season typhoon season as well all the  
way up until November I think so we're here a 
little early for the more well-rounded milder  
hot weather oh yeah good point but also actually 
uh Singapore would have been the closest because  
we're farther north of Singapore by a bit right 
now our hotel just happens to be right across  
the street from the biggest mall in Asia Mall 
of Asia and it also happens to have a carnival  
looking thing that the kids would not leave us 
alone about until we took them over so we'll see  
what kind of rides they want to do this Boardwalk 
goes for miles and miles right along the bay here  
and so you could just walk or bike or whatever 
and that's where all of the carnival stuff is  
here and the Mall of Asia lines this entire spot 
also found it starting off with a carnival classic
in the United States we would never expect 
to find a good restaurant in the middle of  
a shopping mall but here in Manila in the biggest 
mall in all of Asia they have phenomenal food and  
phenomenal restaurants in fact they have the 
most affordable michelin-starred restaurant  
on the planet and we're looking for it right 
now and check out all these Christmas lights  
their Christmas decorations everywhere I 
don't know what that's all about because  
it's not quite Christmas time yet it's still 
September we are just having the damndest  
time finding it we've asked a bunch of people 
and there's a little bit of a language barrier  
but I'm gonna just break out the cellular 
   
a little bit like a wild goose chase we just keep walking 
and I guess one of the downsides to a mall being  
this big is that even the people who work here 
seem to have no idea what we're talking about  
it says now open so we're gonna try and see if we 
can find it inside we found it we found it guys  
it's Singaporean food we just came from 
Singapore it's so trippy they're playing  
this music in here we're months and months and 
months away I thought the US was bad this is  
over the top they're known for their soya 
sauce chicken so that's what we're getting  
it even says here in the tiny tiny print 
world's cheapest Michelin star meal it's  
breathtaking to think that a place like this 
is essentially like quick casual fast casual  
dining and yeah because of this one phenomenal 
dish they have a Michelin star this has to be  
some amazing chicken woohoo here it is I'm so 
excited about this I'm gonna have like a little  
bean a little of this sauce the soy sauce on top is 
really good soya sauce I might have built this  
up a little too much in my head but I'm not 
blown away I feel bad I'm gonna give it one  
more try it's good but my mind is not alone and 
I'm surprised it's like part of a drumstick here  
that is tasty but no more tasty than the one 
we make at home I'm gonna try it on the pork
well it's good with the chicken that was the bite 
I wanted that's the one I'm looking for so that's  
it the one little bite because we have more that 
we're planning to eat tonight but before we leave  
we have to tell you how much it was since it's 
the cheapest Michelin meal you can get it's 168  
Filipino pesos which is only 3.15 in the U.S well 
not bad for three bucks now we're at a totally  
different part of this huge Mall because we wanted 
an authentic Filipino dining experience for dinner  
and this is what they recommended we're not it's 
closed for private events all right we're going  
back to the hotel well that's the way it goes 
we're gonna have to have a different authentic  
Filipino restaurant experience on one of our other 
episodes so follow along with us because we're  
just going back to the hotel now and get there but 
don't go yet because we want to give you a tour  
of this room because it's awesome we have a nice 
little foyer and there's a powder room right there  
a living room over here so come this way I love 
the decoration here because it doesn't feel like  
a hotel room at all it feels like a contemporary 
apartment over here this is where I have coffee  
and espressos are my favorite love it when we 
have nespressos so this living room is kind of  
where the kids are sleeping and they get their own 
TV uh we get our own TV too with a nice king bed  
the windows open up to the garden long sofa couch 
and down this way it's like [Applause] [Music]  
it's a vanity room but we're using it as a closet 
staging area this bathroom's so big check this out
shower walk through nice tub and this is the 
toilet area so that's it my favorite part of  
this room the bathroom for sure because it's about 
the size of the rest of the place too so please  
with us watch our next episode watch the previous 
episode because we are going all over southeast  
Asia specifically the Philippines island hopping 
around so please come along on our journey with us
hello where's your chicken I ate it
[Music]
