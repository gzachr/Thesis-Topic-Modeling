so, let's get this started
for today's video, I am going to talk to you my favorite creamsilk headshots of miss universe philippines 2020 candidates
creamslik is actually one of the leading brands of hair care products  in the philippines and  
they have been a major sponsor for beauty pageants in the philippines ever since
these photos have been taken months back
however I didn't really get a chance to see all of them
they were all beautiful
and these pictures can be used as an official headshots of the girls
so now I've decided to pick my top 10 favorites 
are you ready for this? 
here we go, alright, on the 10th spot is
taguig, sandra, look at this picture
perfect hair, i love the face and the hair 
but I feel like sandra can do better than this one knowing that she's a professional model
from the neck below, I kinda feel that this is an awkward pose
her hands and the legs are not really helping her
they could have taken a shot, a closer look of the face and her hair 
on the 9th spot is bohol, look at this photo
i love the volume of the hair
what I don't like about this picture is the makeup, i feel like it's really  too much for her
comparing this picture with the other photos and videos of bohol
i kinda feel like, i would prefer seeing more natural and fresh looking vibe of bohol
but i love the eyes and the lips
on the 8th spot is albay, look at this picture
she is really simple
but she's ready to compete
i like one because of her long black hair
and i kinda feel the maui taylor - aubrey miles kinda vibe on her   
that's why i like her and no wonder because
in this province, we have a lot of queens like venus raj
and catriona gray
and
the way that you will be looking at miss albay is kinda
dalagang (conversative)  filipina 
very simple but very elegant
on the 7th spot is, paranaque
at first i was so hesitant looking at this picture
because i'm not sure if it's a deodorant or a hair care commercial
looking at this closely
i started to love this picture because
she's looking fresh and i heard that she's a ballerina
so that is why you kinda feel the movement of this picture
she's looking divine and fragrant 
maybe because of the flowers around this picture
i love her look on this picture
she's a niece of a miss universe after all
on the 6th spot is quezon city
i like michelle on this photo 
because it's close up
and the wave of the hair, the movement of the shoulder
she looks very 'senorita'
i like it
what i don't like about this picture is the face
i kinda felt like she's looking too thin
and, she's looking too old
but if you'll compare this photo
with the other photos and videos of michelle
she's actually looking more fresh and younger
than this one, but overall, i like this
on my 5th spot is bulacan
wow
such a dark horse
because i did not have this girl on my initial list
but looking at this picture
i like because of the volume of the hair
after all, this is really a hair care commercial
i like it and i also kinda feel the
miss universe philippines 2014, mj lastimosa vibe on her
i like bulacan
gooo girl
i haven't heard bulacan speak
i should be watching out for her
if she can communicate really well, then 
this girl can definitely be on the top
good luck bulacan
on my 4th spot is, catanduanes
i love this picture because of the styling of the hair
and the smile
look at the pose
i love what she's doing with her finger there
i love it
this girl is actually not new to beauty pageants
because i know that she joined Bb. Pilipinas previously
but she didn't get any crowns
but the way i see it, she could be shining 
 in this competition
another dark horse everyone
on my 3rd spot is, cebu city
my hometown girl
i love this picture
look at the eyes, it's so powerful
i feel the mona lisa vibe on her
i feel like she's telling you a lot of story
the fullness of the lips
the hair that goes with her shoulders
it's so perfect
this is really perfect for shampoo and conditioner commercial
really beautiful, she's very fierce
and every single day, she's killing the game
go cebu city
on my 2nd spot is davao city
look at this picture
it is so simple but very elegant
she has that exquisite 'probinsyana' look
look at the lips
i kinda remember angelina jolie on this picture
would you agree?
i kinda like how she's holding  her hair on this picture
i feel like she's also loving her hair
and it seems that she's trying to send us a message
that even a simple girl out there
they can be as beautiful as alaiza, 
really powerful, go davao city
on my 1st spot, you guys ready for this?
iloilo city
wow, look at this picture, i love it!
the hair seems to be meticulously done
and look at that lazy yet powerful eyes
i love it
the nose, the lips, the bone structure
the shoulder and the hands holding her hair
if you'll combine it altogether, it looks perfect, it looks regal 
i love it and the way  i look at this picture
because she looks mestiza
i feel the latina vibe on her
are you miss brazil,  colombia, puerto rico, mexico
but no, she is miss iloilo city
i feel like the stars are align for you rabiya, 
go for it
i love it
