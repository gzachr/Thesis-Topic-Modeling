so I arrived in Manila yesterday and this
is day one and my first impressions are
that it's very much like Vietnam so
it's quite similar to Vietnam so far and
that's not to say it's identical there's
definitely differences which I'll come
on to you but it's very hot this is the
midday Sun it's beating right down but
it's um... it's nice...
I think first impressions are 
interesting because when
you stay in a place for weeks and months
you very quickly forget what your first
impressions of that place were...
it's energetic there's a lot of traffic it
took me about an hour to drive ten
kilometers from the airport which was
not much fun because you're just kind of sat there...
I could have definitely walked it
I could probably walked... certainly the
last few kilometres I could have walked
faster then than we were driving cos
we were so stationary for such a long
time the traffic really is terrible but
we've got loads of these things here
they're like buses and you hop on and
for about nine I think it's nine pesos
someone told me which 
is so little money it's unreal
I don't even know that is but it's like
maybe ten cents or something then they
go in these loops around the city and
they they drive around
I flew into Manila Airport four days ago
looking out of the plane windows you can
see a lot of well should we say living
accommodation houses or shacks in a very
very small area and since I saw this I
actually read online that Manila is the
most densely populated city in I think
it was the world so I can tell you from
experience that what you see flying in
out of the window would kind of confirm
that there's a lot of people 
in a very very small area
so my taxi driver who picked me up from
the airport which by the way was a
grab-grab is like uber for Asia and it
was very easy to do and he only had a
little car but I hopped in the back just
about squeezed my case in the back and
then hopped in and he was just singing
the whole way back
what was funny was that he wasn't
singing what was on radio he was like
singing some Eric Clapton whilst
Backstreet Boys was on the radio and
then like Westlife would come on and he'd
start singing 'talking to the moon'
but he you know he was really going for
it and lovely guy always smiling only
looked about 15 he might have been like
20 or something but he looked really
young very slim guy and yeah he was he
was a lovely guy I've talked to a lot of
police officers and security people and
yeah they're carrying a huge massive
shotgun but these guys were happy to
have their picture taken
so here we are, just got 
to my hotel room in Manila
just on the east side 
very very small pretty basic
hard to get it all in one shot
really but you get the idea
I paid 11,000 PHP I think they're pesos
yeah which is about 160 pounds or $210
for seven nights so pretty cheap and
to be honest it's got everything I need
it's got a desk, somewhere to hang some
clothes, I'll put my case down here so
yeah it's all good
now Manila the city itself is 
very busy as you'd imagine
with a capital of a country with 100
million people it's kind of chaotic
there's lots going on and there's a lot
of traffic on the road the public
transport system isn't very efficient if
there even is one there's some trains
running around there's some buses but
there's not really any solid kind of well
equipped transport system like an
underground or a metro or a subway or
kind of public buses which have a
timetable and things like that so
everything's a bit crazy but you know
you kind of just learn to go with it you
you expect a two kilometer drive to take
you 20 minutes when you could probably
walk it in half an hour and that's just
kind of that just kind of seems to go
with the culture here
in Thailand, in Vietnam you see a lot of
mopeds you almost see more mopeds than
cars in fact yeah you probably do see
more mopeds here there's definitely more
cars than mopeds so mopeds and
motorbikes are kind of the exception you
wouldn't see many cyclists if any - you
can rent a bike and ride around the park
'Bam Bikes' by the way shout out to
bam bikes they're great and you can
rent a bamboo bike for like a hundred
pesos for an hour which is a bargain and
you can just ride around the park and
see some areas there which is well worth
doing but you wouldn't want to be riding
a bike on the main streets because your
chances of getting hit or crushed 
by a car are pretty high
every sunset in the Philippines seems to be equally as
stunning as the one the night before so
sometimes you know in some countries you
have a good sunset and then like an
average sunset well, it's
early days these are first impressions
but every sunset here seems to be really
incredible and I've watched it from a
few different areas of Manila so far
I should probably explain that here in
Manila it's kind of misleading
to refer to Manila as the city
what Manila really is in my experience
and the way I understand it is, it's
an urban metropolis which is kind of an
amalgamation of several different cities
that are all kind of joined together a
bit I guess you could argue like LA is
metropolis just a sprawling urban
conurbation almost of lots of different
areas well Manila is definitely the same
you've got the the main kind of downtown
central business district area is Makati
and that's where I was staying in this
'hop inn' there's also Pasay slightly
further towards the the sea the ocean.
You've got Intramuros which is kind of
the old part of the town right where the
river kind of flows out to sea
and then you've got this new area over to
the east which is BGC Bonifacio Global
City and I went there today
amazing huge war memorial which is
stunningly impressive I couldn't go in
cos I got that just after closing time
but that is something worth seeing - just
north of that you've got this nice Park
area where there's coffee, bubble tea,
lots of shops a really really smart area
and I tell you what there are different
sides different lives being lived in
Manila I can tell you that for sure
there are the poor parts there are the
wealthy parts there are the old parts
the new parts the smart parts the rough
parts the clean parts the dirty parts
like you can see a rat as I did on the
walk home this evening jump well I
didn't see it jump out (of the bin) 
but I saw it jump in (the bin)
and I just saw his tail and the image
now in my head makes me feel a little
bit sick but there's so many different
areas and moods and feelings within this
city so if you want a nice part go to
BGC Bonifacio Global City on the east it's
gorgeous it's so stunning and you feel
like you're walking through I don't know
Toronto or Vancouver or like a really
nice part of I don't know somewhere like
Portland I've never been to Portland but
really nice smart plush blocks not much
traffic, it's quiet you can actually
drive places at a relatively normal
speed and that was beautiful I then
walked all the way back to the top of
Makati which was always interesting to
see what you find along the way
the air in Manila from what I can see so
far on day two is very similar to that
in Phuket Thailand it's just so in fact
Chiang Mai is even worse but South East
Asia it has to be said, China included of
course it's not one for nice clean air
so as you're walking along you get a lot
of diesel trucks and there's no kind of
requirements for them to be clean about
their emissions so they pump out
whatever they want
there's no MOT there's no like annual
license check for what they pump out of
their exhaust, no catalytic converter
requirements so yeah it's
quite choking with all this traffic in a
small place especially when you've got
certain geographies where you've got like
valleys forming and things it can be
quite horrible so quite often I wear a
mask or mostly I'm not today but you
kind of get used to just walking out and
just smelling diesel...
there's a lot of
guns here I had to stop that last clip
of the 'jubney' or whatever they call it
something like that because there was a
guy like behind me with a gun like
sticking out of his top
there's a much heavier 
emphasis on security here
and if you walk outside 
for more than 10
minutes you will see probably for every
minute you're walking you'll see
somebody with some kind of weapon
whether it's like a security guard in a
7-11 or a police officer or a mall
security guard or just someone standing
outside a random shop you will see a lot
of guns - big guns, small guns, pistols
shotguns, rifles, you'll see all sorts of
guns lots of shops have a sign outside
saying that you must not carry a weapon
inside so that implies that a lot of
people might be carrying weapons if they
were just out and about on the streets
so that's something you do not
experience in Thailand for example
the food here seems to be heavily
influenced by American food so you can
get lots of burgers pizza chicken and
waffle fried chicken all that kind of
thing of course you get Asian food as
well like Vietnamese restaurants you'll
see you can get some fish and all sorts
of cuisine and there really is like in
any capital city you can get anything
you want but there's definitely more
American food here than I've seen in
places like Thailand / Vietnam there's a
more American influence I guess to
do with the history of the country
English levels in the Philippines are
very good so it's very likely that
everyone you meet will speak English
unless they're particularly maybe a bit
older or less well-educated but
certainly compared to Thailand and
certainly China you can expect a much
higher level of English proficiency in
the Philippines than you would in some
other countries in this 
in this part of the world
Philippines is the only country that I
have seen who employ people to sit on a
little stool in the corner of the
elevator or lift and push the button
so you walk in the first time I went to
the mall - I walked in and there was a
girl sat in the lift
she was just sat there in the elevator
and I was kind of I mean I quickly
realized she was wearing a uniform she
had a book with her I quickly realized
she had her hands on the button so I
quickly realized that she was there to
push the button for me but that didn't
make me any less surprised that that was
her job so I found that quite kind of
interesting I just said oh floor for
please and then I explained to her that
I'd never seen anyone who who had this
job before and she kind of smiled and
she was reading a book by 
Mitch Albom I remember that
Tagalog language is quite easy to learn
you can say 'selamat po' for thank you
if you want to get someone's attention
you can just say 'kuya' which means like
brother you can say 'kamusta 
/ kamusta pocoyo' means like
'hi how are you', kumustika 
you can say 'mabutay' - I'm good
mabuting / and it's it's a nice language
to learn and I'd say if you're coming
here, do pick up a few phrases it's well
worth it to kind of engage and interact
and connect more with 
the local people here
