Oops, nope. Just kidding!
Woah, yes extra!
I do entertainment videos,
vlogs, and other things on my channel.
And today, we're at the backstage
of YouTube FanFest 2018
 
Oh my god! Are you all excited?
Because we're going to interview
the creators in
this year's lineup.
How do you feel about YouTube FanFest?
Scared!
Of course it's different now that I'm with Ms Alodia.
We love working together
But of course because we love each other.
You're making me really excited here!
But now we finally found the opportunity to perform together.
Who would think right?
That after one year, now we're here together.
Woah, impressive.
That made my nose bleed.
That's how we party!
How does it feel
when you used to be a part of the pre-show
and then now you're finally on the main stage?
Oh my god!
So how do you...
Thank you so much!
I'm actually very nervous but also very excited.
But you're very good!
You ended up interviewing me.
To life!
Look at that!
Guys, look who's with me. It's Michelle Dy!
Oh my gosh, give me a minute.
So this is very special for me,
I really tried my best to prepare something really good.
In case I won't be here again next year,
so I'd rather give my all this time.
This is it, guys! I have to speak English.
They're gonna make my nose bleed.
Let's go and meet Merrell Twins! Come on!
Oh my god, I don't wanna act like a shy girl
but I can't help it when it comes to D-trix.
Oh my god!
Oh my god, he's actually gonna do it!
Wait, I can do that too!
Okay guys, now that we're done with The Insider Manila,
now I have to go as well
as I need to prepare because I'll be performing too!
hope you enjoyed watching The Insider MIanila.
and if you wanna watch more videos from me...
