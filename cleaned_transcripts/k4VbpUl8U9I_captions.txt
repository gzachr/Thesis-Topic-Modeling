we've been waiting on this day since we
planned our trip to the Philippines so
hopefully it doesn't let us write it
says the monkeys are this way I don't
know how we're gonna find them in this
like jungle okay there's this big every
time we see one they're all sleeping and
the one actually looked at us with these
big eyes and then you write by French
writer what do you think of them
so I just talked to a lady the works and
she said there's 11
in this area right here and the viewing
area and there is 160 in the breeding
area in the back so they're trying to
make more so that we can find the
elusive
charger
they're everywhere looking around
all right oh that might be whenever
there's more people crowding around your
carpet chance when Anna's eyes open look
right at us and right when I got my
camera closed his eyes tarsiers
okay
I've ever seen oh my god the end I don't
want to leave
yeah
