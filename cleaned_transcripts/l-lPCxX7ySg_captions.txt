very good very good seaweed a little 
bit sour from the lemon but perfect  
and so much garlic inside that 
all the Vampires will go away
not good for me because I'm from Pennsylvania 
and my vampire Roots will go with good but um
and now time for the main event 
this is your favorite place
[Music]  
a moment of silence I died this is the best and 
the good thing is the fact that they didn't put  
anything on it they just left the taste of the 
dish and it's amazing and it has some Char here  
let me try the hottest part this is supposed 
to be amazing [Music] oh yes the Char part
[Music]
[Music]
there's another one
[Music]
the thing is that it's simple fish it's not much 
things put on it it's just how I like it the taste  
of the fish that is not over powered by any rub 
or by any kind of sauce or by any kind of stuff
it's nice fish in the world it's very meaty 
it feels like chicken or wow it's a very  
beefy yeah structured texture that's 
why they say that the tuna is the beef  
of the sea I never thought today I would 
be biting from a piece of tuna like this
one of the best things ever okay GG I came 
up with an idea since you won an experiment  
fish here with a little bit of 
salt and a little bit of soy sauce
okay and now mix it around
and now you tell me if this one 
is better than the regular one
[Music]
better or worse I like it I don't 
have that it's better like this  
honestly or you're just telling 
me to not hurt my feelings [Music]  
so apparently I have made a very good I'm gonna 
try it also for myself let's repeat the process
to make it even more better mom and now [Music]
[Music]
the food is finished  
yes okay now did you time to go pay the nice 
lady and uh we can continue with our journey
some of this and some of this 300. 
oh you can take this one with me  
because I still haven't finished 
mine and we can go and continue
oh man this fish was so good I don't think I can 
eat anything anymore I'm stuffed we can go around  
here a bit and just look and see what we have 
left here to see and do but I don't know if it's  
gonna be any more eating I think probably some 
sweets but that's it there's some ice cream too  
organic ice cream and more ice cream cookies and 
creamed I think this is the difference maybe no  
maybe maybe no it's the mower of the food more 
of the fried stuff more of the fried stuff for  
the good stuff all these things around okay 
and there is also like some electronic shops  
like maybe did I hear you say mango flow did you 
yes okay we definitely have to get a mango float  
a bit later now I have to get the tuna inside 
the belly to fit yes inside the building yes  
and there's some like pieces food approval phones 
and yes this place kind of reminds me of the Night  
Market in Cebu where you have on one side the food 
area and on the other side the shopping area all  
the way till the back there yes I was saying it's 
all the way from there sure let's go okay [Music]
foreign
[Music]
it's incredible this is like you have to 
come here at least four times to see the  
whole market and walk through the whole market 
and see at least half the shops and August what  
we have to go back because I want to get some 
sweets [Music] oh my God I think the whole
it is yes hello hi how much on this one 2800.
[Music]
okay thank you
what do you think
very serious yes they look like basketball shoes
to be the all the shoes that I like are either 
too small or too expensive maybe because they  
see me that I'm Foreigner they bump a little bit 
of rice or maybe not or maybe this is just how  
the night market is but oh yeah I think we have to 
move away from this section because I'm only only  
gonna get more upset and more upset and more upset 
I'm not gonna find anything so yeah let's go yes
