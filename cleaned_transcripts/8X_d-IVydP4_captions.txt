Welcome To Paradise eh so this is stop
number one and it's literally Called
Paradise Beach

unbelievable so glad I decided to come
back in the Limestone Cliffs are just
[Music]
what do you think about this one
yeah no no the island
[Laughter]
and no one is here we're the only ones
yeah
you feel like a millionaire yeah I mean

[Music]
[Music]
so we've just arrived at this one I
don't know what it's called but the only
people on the beach
and it's unbelievable privately owned by
a Filipino guy so they're happy to have
tourists here but it's not on the main
boat tour groups of it so we're staying
at Outpost hostel which has kind of
their own little Island Tour routes
rather than the mainstream if you stay
somewhere in the town you end up going
on the same on the same routes as
everyone else so we get the opportunity
to be on the secluded Islands which is
nice oh yeah and I forgot to film lunch
as well I'm getting bad at that so I'm
going to try in future to make sure I
film everything because that was
unbelievable wasn't it yeah it was a
best fish I ever had yeah like fresh
fresh tuna yeah chicken rice and noodles
yes struggling for vegetables you see
[Music]
we're now in a lagoon and I'm doing all
the paddling oh God
[Music]
so there's a few different lagoons in El
Nido there's a famous Big Lagoon and
small Lagoon and this is another one
that they've taken us to because they
said it's obviously again less touristy
and we pretty much got it to ourselves
which is pretty sweet
[Music]
pretty outrageous day
just at the last stop now helicopter
Island and
making my way down the beach I've just
gone back to get the GoPro because the
snorkeling here is decent there's a
little bit of coral out there where
one else is so gonna head out and join
them now after that day I've been in the
city and like almost well two and a half
days of traveling feels so much calmer
and more refreshed now just buzzing to
get on with the rest of the trip

else so you're saying like my in my
right so I gotta save lives over here to
