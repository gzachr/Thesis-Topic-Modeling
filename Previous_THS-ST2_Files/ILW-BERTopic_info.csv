sweet dessert all right so there we go oh yeah nothing better than that sound of the ice mixing in making an ice cold there we go the Shaker right there that's gonna be Ayos."", ""I know that seems simple but it happens all the time and it drives foreigners and nuts because you cannot be at the Starbucks at p.m. if you're leaving your house half an hour away at p.m. it's impossible it's impossible you're not gonna get there in seconds if it takes minutes which again this is why you leave early now I know a lot of excuses come up and the text will be well I'm late I'm the the traffic and I couldn't get a jeepney and I was waiting on my babysitter and I just got out of the shower and my brother you know went to the sari-sari store how that connects with anything nobody knows but here's the thing is we foreigners know that every single day filipinas wake up every single day millions of them and they they get on a jeepney for minutes and they show up at work and they clock in on time every day six days a week if they got to start their shift at : a.m. or : a.m. they already know they got to leave early they already know they got to account for the jeepney they already know how long it takes to get from the street to their time clock so that they can clock in on time so we know you can do it which is why when we wait for up to two hours because we're being told I'm almost there I'm almost there and really you haven't even left the house yet or decided to stop by your sister's house to borrow some shoes at : when you should have been at the Starbucks at o'clock so I will tell you I'm telling you this because I want your date to go good so my recommendation to you filipinas is please show up on time treat it as if it was your starting shift for your job it's that important because we know you can do it we know you can plan and arrive the place on time because you do it for work all the time or you do it for school so when when you leave us waiting for half an hour an hour hour and a half two hours it tells us we're not that important to you we're not important enough that you would plan ahead and be there on time that's what it tells us so if what we're sitting there waiting alone thinking you know if she really wanted to be here on time she would have left earlier I guess she's really not that interested so as I mentioned a common courtesy is to wait minutes and if there's a text we'll wait another minutes after minutes even with excuses the person waiting has the right to just reschedule or cancel the meeting the date so do not expect a foreigner to wait more than minutes it won't matter how many excuses you got you could have been there on time and so after minutes if if you're not there expect that a foreigner may very well get up out of this chair pay for his coffee and leave and what he does after that he may give you another chance on another day you know he might reschedule and say you know I had plans now we're gonna miss the movie that I had planned or we're gonna miss this or that so we're gonna have to reschedule now if you're lucky he will reschedule on another day if you're not so lucky he's gonna say you know what she's just not taking this serious so he's gonna get out his phone and he's gonna go through his contacts or he's gonna go on one of the dating apps and or he's gonna just walk into the mall he's gonna find someone else to go out with who can be there on time so if you want a good dating experience with your foreigner boyfriend show up on time if you show up half an hour late minutes late an hour late don't expect him to be there don't expect them to be there I mean some men are very patient maybe even too patient and if you're lucky he's one of those guys but really he's already been insulted you've already been rude to him you already had him sitting there waiting for an hour because you didn't think it was important enough to leave on time okay so that's it that's it if you really want your date to go good plan on being there five minutes before if he says o'clock plan on being there five minutes to seven and you'll impress him okay now that's all I really have to share with you filipinas if you want you can end the video right now I'm going to talk to the expats now and we're just gonna kind of like go over this ourselves now if you've been dating in the Philippines for any period of time again I've been dating on and off here for the last six years and when I dated in the United States it was it would happen its life sometimes you do get caught in traffic and the thing is though pretty consistently if a date was going to delay more than - minutes I usually got a text and they would text I'm at such-and-such intersection they would let me know where they were so that I could calculate okay well you know traffic there at this intersection you know there's communication and and it's usually honest communication I'll give you an example I was now meanwhile in the Philippines give an example I was in CDO and I hadn't even planned on going out on a date that night but a Filipina contacted me on Facebook and said hey I heard you're in CDO I want to meet you at the mall and you know big fan of your videos all that I said okay so I got dressed and I said okay let's go meet at the mall at : and we can get some dinner and get to know each other so I arrived at : I got there a little bit early even though I had never been decidió I I got on the taxi early and and I got there at : at the mall and then I had to I'd only been there once before so I had to find my way to where we were gonna meet at the food court and by : I was there waiting at the food court and I waited until : we were supposed to meet at : and by : no texts nothing saying that she's late nothing and then around : I got a text and are you there well of course I'm there it's : or it's : and we were gonna meet at : so yes I am here and and then it became this tumbling random text I'm almost there I'm just about there I'm in the jeepney now this went on until : : now this went on until : it had already been almost two hours an hour and minutes and she finally at : said after already telling me she got out of the shower after telling me she's already on her way now at : she says oh my sister showed up so now she's gonna watch my baby and now can leave the house and I said well where are you how far are you from the mall and she goes oh it's not far it's only minutes now she's already an hour minutes late she already told me she's on her way and now she's telling me she's about to leave the house at : when she was supposed to be there at : and she's not gonna get there till quarter to : which is minutes before the mall closes so I told her no I'm leaving I mean I really shouldn't have waited beyond half an hour but again I believed the text she was sending me and that's the message that I'm gonna share with you expats I've made this mistake believing what they tell me now I have a whole new approach to it and this is what I want to recommend to all expats I think we need to communicate to all Filipinos through our actions that we're gonna have from now on a standard rule a standard rule which is if if there's no text to explain why they're late minutes after the date no text at all we're free to walk away if there is a text within the first minutes of them being late and they're saying they're on their way we'll give them another minutes because that minutes plus the next minutes makes minutes now if after minutes they're still telling us well I'm on my way I'm almost there when they should have been there a half hour ago we need to let them know it will be our decision whether we will exercise or exercise our right or not - now walk out because they're more than minutes late so if they say I'm almost there and and I'm like don't leave because I'm almost there we have the option to either leave at the minute mark or if they're telling the truth if they're telling the truth that they really are almost there give them one last minutes shot that's a total of minutes we don't have to give them that but if we're being really generous to the patient that day we go okay and if she's still not there after explicitly saying that she's almost there in the next minutes which is now minutes late we got to just walk we got to just leave even if they do show up at minutes we need to just go because it's just insane there has to be consequences this is why they show up on time at their job every day because there would be consequences they would be fired if they showed up at work every day an hour or two hours late they would get fired and and if this girl is trying to make a good impression on us and she can't even respect our time to show up within minutes of the agreed time she's understand we're rescheduling tonight's date is done in fact at minutes we really have the option to just walk the extra minutes is like the last bit of grace she's gonna get but really at minutes if she tells us after being minutes late that she's almost there and she's still not there minutes late we really got to start walking we just got to go and either reschedule that if we really want to go out with her reschedule it reschedule it to the next day the next weekend whatever there needs to be a consequence to making us wait it's just really extremely rude and and we also have the option of just going you know I I want to be with a girl who wants to be with me wants to be with me enough that she'll show up on time not leave me lollygagging around for two hours while she's picking out a pair of shoes at her sister's house before she even gets on the jeepney know we need to start down line minutes wait a little longer if there's a text within that first minutes if they're still not there in minutes and now it's the st minute we really got to just walk just walk and and if you're really that disgusted find someone else to date you know you're probably already at the mall just go and chat up to girl and ask her what time she gets off work and then take her out you know or get on get on one of the the dating apps and and say hey what are you doing at o'clock I'm already at the mall you know my date didn't show up you want to meet and then take them to the movies you know take them to a nice dinner because the other girl again you know if she's gonna show up late and unannounced bring along some friend that she never mentioned and and just show up with this other friend and say oh I hope it's okay well no that's not gonna fly either we need to just say you know I had a date scheduled with you you showed up half an hour late with a friend we're gonna talk about this over text but tonight's date is not gonna happen sorry and then just walk away and and you know again if she's gonna say well I got all the way over here yeah you got over here half an hour late with an extra friend so we really got to start laying down the law and again it'll start communicating through action that no the days of us waiting around an hour or two hours for them to show up and totally change the schedule totally change the plan totally everything that's got to end so minutes if they contact us we'll give them another minutes if they're still not there after minutes we have the free and clear option to just walk reschedule the date or get a date with someone else we really got to start doing this and I believe as we do they're gonna start realizing you know we should show up on time because the girls that show up on time there they're getting the dates with the foreigners and the foreigners are walking from the girls who show up two hours late so it's gonna take some time it's gonna taste some consistency and that's that's really what I'm putting out there for all you expats when you get out here don't don't become a doormat don't don't sit there and wait desperately for two hours for her to show up while she she's because here's the other thing if she tells you she's on her way at minutes after : and then she tells you minutes later she's about to get on the jeepney you know what that means she lied to you so not only is she showing that she can't be punctual she's showing that she can't she can't be counted on to tell the truth and if she claims oh well I misunderstood I thought you meant you wanted me to leave the house at : and and then just show up and I'll be there when I get there well even that is not a big improvement over lying because that shows that there's really a communication problem if you're gonna date a girl you want to date a girl that you could communicate with and if she can't figure out the difference between arriving somewhere at : and leaving her house at : you probably want somebody with better English skills than that so that's my recommendation to you expats a -minute grace period after that it's up to you you want to sit around for two hours fine I'm saying we need to start laying down the law and just saying you know if you can't show up within minutes of the agreed time I'll find someone who will that's what we need to communicate all right love to hear your feedback tell me your stories about Filipinos how late they showed up how how long you waited how it went and we'll talk about it there in the comment section all right see you then you"", ""it looks like they're building a brand new Spa right there and it seems like a pretty decent sized Beach Grill to the left a nice little food truck right there to the right some good Tunes I'll get some tacos that's one thing I'll tell you in El Nido everywhere you can go you can find Mexican food in the Filipino version not as white of sand as like the main beach in El Nido but like or maybe it's because it's wet at the moment but still a really nice Vibe here a lot of like tree coverage leading up to the beach which gives it more of that jungle feel and one thing I've noticed in the Philippines all around they have like a dedicated smoking area you can't just like smoke outside anywhere have you noticed that too bro that's the first time I noticed it all over the Philippines they have dedicated sections for smokers to go yeah guys so this is another perspective of seeing the area of uh El Nido this is the beach if you remember in the previous video when we were flying in that was the uh that was the dock right there the pier that we were looking out at and the plane basically flew right in there all the way down and landed as we're really close to the airport here oh actually this will be my first time touching the water bro Let's test it out see if it's any good all right oh yeah nice and warm so guys if you want to spend some time at Leo Beach if you got a lot of time in El Nido this would be from what it seems like a good place to spend like an afternoon in there's like shops and other areas that line this way and it's one of those beaches where if you're trying to enjoy the outside yet not get as much of a tan the tree coverage is is perfect for that I mean there's not too many beaches in the world I've seen that actually have like all these different types of trees that close to the beach so it is definitely what kind of sets this place apart and all down there I want to say there's like shops and things want to loop back this way bro so lots and lots of nice like uh cafes here it seems like giving up their smoothie bowls yoga classes and a uh a lot of like places to lounge around good digital Nomad working space to be close to the beach yet also close to a fresh delicious coffee in this area so yeah it's it's really nice guys you obviously been watching from the beginning of this video if you're still here and there's a lot of rain before but it can be moody here the weather and so you know you can just wait around for a couple hours and then well it's not like perfect beach weather right now it's at least not raining so it's still worth coming down if your part of your day gets rained upon and check out what's going on in this area. And I'm not sure if these are like hotels in these areas seems like there's some lounging areas up top bars on the first floor but it kind of has given me that Resort style vibe that first look definitely plenty of options if you've got a few days to do a little bit of a restaurant hopping in the area but yeah guys we only have a couple hours of daylight so we're probably not even a couple hours at this point probably one and a half hours so we're gonna keep cruising on the mopeds a little bit further to what's uh supposed to be an even better like Beach area so knock Pond yeah all right not fun as what is like minutes from here uh yeah nice all right so we'll cruise over to the knock Pong guys and uh you'll get a small little tour with us of today's uh excitement exploring the different beaches in the area good all right we're heading back out this way and looks like we're gonna be going to the uh right let's get this bread all right we're about minutes away and as you can see this is some of the nature here in Boracay more of those beautiful palm trees and just a really wet feeling climate around here I will say I love the island but you're hot sticky and humid all the time during this time of the year I like it because it's Island line been cruising for a bit uh very rural is a better way to say it not too much except more and more jungles but a nice peaceful drive especially now that the sun's coming out.""]"

you just need to dig in to be honest let's start we're going to start off with Roti John that's what I love about Malaysians you know because they're they're very friendly yes they're all asking like where we're from and they were so good at like helping us yes what to pick as well let's start this one so a lot of the locals were saying that they only sell some of the things to Ramadan so that kind of makes it feel like a really good cultural experience and we've never experienced a Ramadan before this is actually our first time trying Rottie John this type of bread and omelette some chicken lettuce some spring onions and lots of sauce a lot a lot of sauce I've noticed that in Malaysia they love sauce like you're a saucy Saucy Nation um how is it not nice sweet chili sauce it's not too spicy as well and the bread the bread is just so soft this is nice it's really nice it was a big mouthful it was delicious honestly I wasn't expecting to um like that as much as I do because I thought it'd just be kind of like a sandwich but it's really flavorful it doesn't feel like bread I know it is bread it looks like bread but I'm not getting bread Vibes I mean we've got lots more we've got lots more to try can we try this because it's right in front of me I've been eyeing this up since we left so this is a vegetable spring roll we've had vegetable spring rolls before but let's see how this is cheers good crunch oh wow it tastes different not really at all I like not only there's I thought there's going to be greens I'm not sure what kind of vegetable this is right so uh maybe it's cabbage leave a comment Down Below guys what this is um because it's a hard workout do you try the sauce as well it's really good hey there's loads it's not that spicy I don't know yeah um it's a bit hot I thought all spring rolls would taste the same but actually that's got a different taste to it I mean I love that I'm not sure what this one is potato oh yes sir Samosa it's like it looks like that's so true okay let's go oh my God that's my favorite so far wow it's got like some kind of flavoring around the potato mmm that's so nice we should have got more of this coated in some kind of um it was really good I might just go back tomorrow like the combination of things I'm tasting right now is just incredible have you eaten the whole thing already yeah well done I'm telling you I'm hungry should we go to the vein yeah yeah all right so now my favorite part we actually had one on the plane last night it was quite funny the packaging said best last evening I highly doubt that the airplane one is the best one but hopefully this is gonna be better so if you don't know what national map is it's basically um the Malaysian national food and it is coconut rice piece of meat you can either be chicken or beef you've got your and anchovies anchovies nuts nuts and what's this um cucumber cucumber eggs and what's this fish it's actually come on a banana leaf and they were so good because everyone was kind of serving themselves but we didn't really know about how it was meant to how it's meant to work and they were so nice they just did it for us and they were like explaining everything so it's so good and I got this big piece of chicken here look how big that chicken is what's so nice about Nasi Lemak as well is I'm not sure what it is but it has this kind of like really crispy almost hairy coating but it's like almost like flakes of something um chicken is amazing it's so flavorful oh my word that's really good that's better than the other two we've had best Nasi Lemak I've had so far the rice is amazing as well so good there's so many different flavors I can taste coconut I can taste lemongrass I can taste like all these different spices and herbs on the chicken really juicy these sort of flavors I've never just a lot of flavors just going on but they're the sort of flavors I'm just I've never really had that often and the rice is just insane not too spicy either yeah the one that they um on the plane yesterday so he was like so spicy it's so spicy give the video a like if you're getting hungry watching us eat do you want some nasty lamac you know the food is good if I'm not talking that much yum can't stop the rice is just so nice any locals want to tell us kind of like how you do Ramadan uh give us a little bit more information because we've done a little bit of research on Google but it basically just tells you the very simple facts I'm enjoying it though I like trying all these different things and everything was pretty good price as well I think oh it's the best part it's time for some sweet sweet desserts so since we already tried this time we should try it first so we didn't mean to try it the guy was like please try it try it so he tried it honestly describe it it's like a bad name yes it looks like a bird's nest look at that it's like what even is that um smells so good as well ready Cheers Cheers wow that's so good and the texture is so strange but I love it it's kind of so crunchy but so it's so thin so subtle and it just kind of breaks in your mouth it's crumbly I wonder what it is it's so cool I don't even know the name to Google it I wonder what flavor this is this is pistachios it's pistachio I'm not really keen on pistachio but let's see um good wow no it's so crunchy I love this wow I don't know why we haven't tried this on our first time here last year I've never seen it is this only during Ramadan as well guys I tried it was amazing um yum it's one of my favorite desserts ever so you can have it every day if you want once a day pancake now we did actually the last time we were here but let's this one's different it's got sweet corn in it is that on purpose or did that just accidentally cut I'm not sure get in here cheers that's so strange it was nice dude wait yeah yeah there's a sweet corn in it we got the um the Nutty filling you can get chocolate and get some as stuff this is so strange I can't get over the sweet corn it's really sweet and then you've just got this corn flavor but it's nice the pancake's really good as well really fluffy all right so to finish it off we got this one here I literally just saw it and I was like so cute it's kind of like a mousse it looks like something that was like a liquid that's now dried um said it was coconut and oh like a spoon so it's like a mousse it smells nice is it in a Banana Leaf I can't remember what it's called oh this is like nothing we've ever had before is it good that's so good oh that's good that is nice it's not too sweet as well it's just perfect it's not rich yeah I can't believe there's not a single thing that I haven't thoroughly enjoyed like every single thing we've tried has been like out of good like there's not been anything it's just been like oh it's okay that's all been really good Malaysia just seems like a Foodies Paradise honestly the flavors are just incredible finish mine already anyway we've had such a good time today I really enjoyed interacting with the locals I just found it so wholesome that that first the first three they really they're so Lively as well they're so nice and they were really interested in like Czar and then Zar was obviously interested in him because at first I couldn't tell if he was joking or not because like they were all just shouting out they were like telling us to go around the store and then they're gonna show us how they how to cook the Roti John yeah they put inside it oh we forgot the drink and oh yes but we're gonna hold it there because we actually forgot to show you the Thai tea that we got so you can actually get this for just five ring it if you get it in a cup but because we're taking it away we thought it'd be better to get it in the bottle so this was actually tendering it so a little bit more pricey I would drink out of this we're in a glass might as well couldn't get from there I don't know what makes it orange me and Zoe were not we're not a big fan of tea despite the fact We're British we are actually we don't drink tea very often but I can appreciate tea though it smells like chocolate does it oh that is nice is it sweet um is it sugary it's a very small hint of tea yes it's very milky but I like that I like that it's like a subtle tea because like I said we're not big tea drinkers I find it a bit too strong but this that is nice a very wheat chocolate no it tastes like tea I drink that like that's nice but anyway guys hopefully you like the video if you did make sure

Carreras Domingo & Pavarotti they are so so so cute they are fabulous next reaction of TNT boys I will do it with my son because he\'s years old my son likes Jackson and would be nice to see his reaction to them and you know what it\'s very hard to sing in this range for a kid I mean this opera lyrical classical way to round the voice is not so easy and you should have a very strong diaframma sometimes they were breathless but they did a great job great! The customer this time didn\'t distract me too much probably because I know a lot this performance done from the Maestros this was a very very great super super react to tnt boys I love them I\'m a huge fan they are and years old let me know their names!', ""hello everybody my name is katrinka i'm a professional singer and a vocal coach and welcome back to my channel today i'm gonna be reacting to another of your really heavily expected recommendations and it's gonna be regina velazquez now i hope that i'm pronouncing her name correctly because she's been very heavily requested from what i've understood she is one amazing vocalist and she is up there with like a thripple of katrina velard and maury said and other fantastic singers today we're gonna be reacting to our gabi live on wish if you would like to see the whole performance don't forget to check the description of the video and there's gonna be the link to the original video and yes don't forget to subscribe our new upload schedule is up on the youtube banner and i'm also coming back to my streams i'll be streaming on wednesdays and on sundays check the streaming schedule in the description of my video there's also gonna be what we're gonna be doing on the streams so you can look forward to them and now without any further ado miss regine velasquez let's get into this i swear to god if she's gonna be just like another one on the same level i'll be jealous and she's also pretty shocked oh i love when they sing in their original language it has completely different atmosphere the melody is very addictive like i feel like already it's very well memorable oh beautiful the melody is very dominant and it's very memorable but it's still the way she sings it i feel like she's reciting even though there's a lot of melody in it but the way she delivers it's a very high-based song even though it doesn't look like that on the first side but she push and pull and she's just going it's incredible she doesn't even do big breath pauses just to keep the fluency of the storytelling that she's making in the song and what is really wonderful is that she's so fluent that you cannot even hear her switches from her chest voice to her mix it's just one beautiful stream it's incredible i love it very intricate you can tell beautiful ending of the princess um the very high high tone i think okay so what i'm absolutely swept away with is how fluent she is there is no visible switches between her registration whatsoever like you cannot hear them they are there because she is going fluently from one to another but as she's doing it's just so it's invisible it's completely invisible you feel like she's not switching at all but she is switching but just completely fluently at the very beginning she was just switching between her chest voice and her mix but now it's also up to falzetto like a very high falsetto that was a little visible but that was also a huge jump and she finished it with a beautiful full head voice it's very obvious that her voice is very mature it's finished it's done it's perfection it's really really beautiful kind of a voice and i'm really enjoying her whole technique is just so intriguing and delicate it's incredible you can also tell there's no nervousness in her whatsoever she's completely cool collected foreign oh beautiful run wonderful run look at her she's just such a jolly person very pretty one memorize the tune she's very relaxed like you can tell she's not just mentally very relaxed she is in a very calm collected place she's not stressed she's not tense whatsoever she's even like switching her sitting positions which is very typical for a wish but someone in the last video that i reacted on which someone told me that they have to sit because a lot of times they're actually in a moving bus which is then absolutely understandable why they sit but for belting it's really way more difficult than uh standing up her belts are effortless she has everything extremely relaxed and uh yeah i feel like we're getting to finally so let's see did you see the big a little rasp in her belt there was a little respite end of the phrase too so i think she did it on purpose her voice has so many different colors it's incredible her voice is like rainbow and she was just literally painting with tons and tons and tons of colors i know that i'm using where it's incredible and amazing a lot but especially with these singers that's how i genuinely feel inside and fuzzy and happy because i got to hear that that was pretty fast based song and singing this clean with this invisible fluent switches just takes a lot of control so she had an amazing voice control her voice had a wonderful color in all of her registers and her chest voice and her mix but also her head voice of falsetto was really major pretty heavy so it matched with the rest of them very beautifully but i would definitely call her like queen of switches because you cannot see them you cannot hear them you wouldn't find them if you try everything was very well done very intricate very detailed her voice is definitely a very major it's very finished done polished and also at a very last bill she had a little bit of a rasp and she then added it at the very end of the song where she closed her throat a little bit to create an effect i'm just gonna show oh my god this is such a beautiful human she's just a such a good vocalist that it was so obvious that she could invest all of her attention into the emotional side of the song into into transmitting the emotions into the music and completely sweeping you off your feet as the audience so wonderful thank you so much for recommending um regina i am absolutely honestly lord i thought this is gonna be very good but i didn't think it's gonna be this good so if you enjoyed the video don't forget to subscribe and tip the notification bell because every single time i upload a new video i respond and

shampoo as well yeah that's pretty much what we got and all these cost pesos I don't know if it's a good price but we bought a supermarket so I think that's the best we could get otherwise I think our veggies the only place you could like really save money on it's it's like probably the veggies we can buy local Fresh Market but just then it was just too much hustle for us because you know it was a bit far away and we had to carry everything and go to fresh fruit Market it might be just not worth it so anyway we grab everything here and yeah that's pretty much we we're living here in Cebu for one month like you know like a normal person really yeah and it really it's my first time ever that actually feels like staying at a home you know so because place where I can go anyways yes it's first time ever because I've been traveling non-stop for nine months so yeah this really is an experience and especially living with Alina that's so it's going to be quite cute I think yeah so uh yeah that's about it oh this is our apartment yeah and this is our motivation exactly it says Inspire lead a creative life which is exactly what we're doing the two of us yeah creating awesome content we buy new Lighting in Manila which is in divisoria which you guys saw the vlog yeah divisoria and we've got this ring light and it's been super handy because we we should shoot a lot of like TikToks and and anyway there's natural Lighting in the morning here from this balcony and let me give you guys the room tour as well so this is our kitchens so excuse order mess on the floor but this is our kitchen and you can see this is my mini workspace which is good because it's separated from our main bedroom because Alina she's very sensitive to uh noise so even tiny bit of movements or like keyboard sound to wake her up so it's good that I've got a table there and we've got a balcony yeah and here this is our bedroom for this month all right so let me see let me turn the light so here we've got a mini balcony outside as well so this basically our room not particularly a big bed but we've got like a wardrobe here as well in our toilet so you can go shower space uh yep so pretty standard facilities and because we are living in this condo and we paid Australian dollars for this condo it's an Airbnb and it comes with a swimming pool as well as a gym as well so I don't know if that's a good price but you guys have any better places as far as you say let us know in the comments because we might be you know extending I was thinking in Cebu who knows we'll never know but of
