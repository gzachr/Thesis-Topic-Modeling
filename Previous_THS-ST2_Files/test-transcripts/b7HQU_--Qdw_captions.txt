(Conquering the nature in Oslob, Cebu)
(Whale sharks)
(We saw the whale sharks in Cancun, Mexico)
- Taegon and Kangnam. / - Right.
That's Mexico.
It startled me.
(How will the whale sharks in Oslob look?)
(5-minute walk from the restaurant)
- 5-minute walk? / - Right.
- But... / - It's quite close.
- We've arrived at last. / - We're finally going, right?
Yes.
- Sookyung, let me explain. / - Yes?
This place is managed by the government,
so there's a time limit.
- Does it mean we must hurry? / - Yes.
That's why we came here in a hurry.
- That's right. / - But look at all these people.
- There are so many people. / - It's packed, right?
It's no joke.
- I can't believe this. / - It's so crowded.
(It's packed even in the morning)
Wow, no way.
(In Mexico, they had to head out for 3 hours)
That's true. They had to go for 3 hours.
There aren't many places where
you can see whale sharks.
(In Cebu, it only takes 5 minutes)
5 minutes?
(When the fisherman throws the food into the sea)
(Whale sharks follow him around)
(Yummy)
- Goodness. / - It follows you.
It follows him like a goldfish.
- Is it a pet? / - The whale sharks...
(A goldfish? A pet?)
- Is it a pet? / - They come for shrimp.
They're so cute.
- You have to go early. / - Yes, early in the morning.
- Gosh. / - It's really big.
(Snorkeling with whale sharks)
(Whale sharks can be seen from 6 a.m. to 11 a.m.)
If you go there on the weekend and
swim with the whale sharks...
- You'll be really energized. / - Yes.
That would keep me energized for a year.
(They put on life vests)
- I'm color coordinated. / - What?
You really are!
(Finally)
(They head out)
We're finally going to see the whale shark.
It's nice.
The ocean in the Philippines is so pretty.
Yes. It's really pretty.
(The clear and pretty sea of Cebu)
- The color is so nice. / - It's so clear.
- You're going to a deeper place. / - Yes.
(Around where the color changes to darker blue)
Look. He's throwing the food.
- He's throwing shrimp. / - Yes.
He's throwing them over there.
They feed them.
Yes. They follow you when you throw them food.
Are they small? It's quite shallow here...
- Over there! / - Where?
Look over there!
- Hi! / - Can you see?
Over there. Whale shark!
- It's so cute. / - Goodness.
Goodness, it's a whale shark.
You can see them even if you aren't in the water.
(The whale shark's spots are clearly visible)
Sookyung, it's a whale shark.
- I want to see it. / - Did you see it?
- No, I want to see it in the water. / - I see.
It's over there!
He's bringing it over here.
"He's bringing it."
- "He's bringing it." / - Goodness.
(Bringing it over with food)
- Unbelievable. / - Hi.
Goodness.
- It's following him. / - It follows him.
- Gosh, how is this possible? / - It's like a puppy.
You have to clean it with spit.
It's faster to clean it with spit.
- Are you going in the water now? / - Yes.
It's here.
Nami is in a hurry.
Let's go in quickly.
- Water. / - Whale shark.
- Where? / - There.
(The whale shark is right in front of them)
Whale shark.
(Come in quick)
- Wow. / - It's right in front of you.
It's right in front of you.
- Wow. / - Goodness.
- Wow. / - It's right in front of you.
(Whale shark, Rhincodon typus)
(They grow between 12 to 18m)
- Goodness. / - It wants to eat salted shrimp.
- It's so cute. / - Gosh.
- Goodness. / - It's so cute.
- It's huge, but it's so cute. / - Isn't the tail 2m long?
(A whale shark appeared suddenly in 2011)
(Fishermen started feeding it and more of them came)
(They are gentle in nature and do not attack people)
(They only eat salted shrimp thrown to them)
- It feels weird. / - Precautions.
- You must not touch them. / - You can't touch them.
You have to stay calm so they don't get scared.
That's right. You shouldn't touch them.
They were eating right in front of me. I felt like...
- I was getting sucked in. / - They're so close.
- They know we're coming. / - Get a hold of yourself.
Get a hold of yourself.
My son loves whale sharks.
I really want to go.
(Whale sharks don't shy away)
Is that Sookyung?
I was scared.
(What is she doing?)
- Who is it? Is that you? / - Are you having fun?
- She's hanging on dearly. / - It's because...
No way.
- How is that possible? / - You're that flexible?
Are you hanging on?
- No. / - You're going backward.
Sookyung!
Why didn't you just stay on the boat?
- I wanted to see it. / - You're so funny.
- Because it's so close. / - It was too close.
- Look at your legs. / - You're holding on so dearly.
Help.
Wait. I'm not ready to meet you.
Don't come near.
(She is hanging on with her legs)
Look at that.
- In case it touches your legs? / - That's too much.
(But I'm cute, right?)
- It's so funny. / - Goodness.
- Are you okay? / - Yes.
There's a baby shark next to it. Is it its baby?
I don't think so.
It feeds on it's...
- It's a suckerfish. / - Suckerfish.
They clean the whale shark's body.
It sure is a shark. A suckerfish is stuck to it.
It cleans the body.
- Good? / - Good.
(Thanks)
Look. It's really close to me.
(They regroup and jump in for the second time)
(She's pointing at something)
- What did you see? / - What did you see?
That there are more?
There were a lot of whale sharks.
- Amazing. / - More came.
There were two, and then three.
Another one came because we were there.
- Goodness. / - They're standing.
- My gosh. / - I was surprised to see them stand.
(They keep opening and closing their mouths)
- She's saying there are 3 sharks. / - 3 sharks.
- Three sharks. / - Amazing.
(There are 3 sharks, not 2)
Gosh, it's huge.
(One shark)
It's hard to see even one in an aquarium.
- It's lovely. / - It's so cute.
They're hard to see, but there are three of them.
- Yes. / - It's so amazing that they're so close.
(There are three whale sharks)
(From above, you can see four sharks)
- Were there 4 sharks? / - Yes.
There are more of them than the boats.
Four sharks came.
- They came to have breakfast. / - Yes, for breakfast.
How can they look like that? They're so cute.
- They're so cute. / - Their mouths are so cute.
- It's so cute. / - Their eyes.
- It came. / - They're...
- It's huge. / - It's really big.
(Finally, they enjoy snorkeling)
Don't you feel blissful when you're next to them?
- You get overwhelmed, don't you? / - Yes, you do.
- I know that feeling. / - It's like a spaceship.
Yes.
Isn't it so pretty?
Everyone has fallen for the whale sharks.
I think Yujin will go there soon.
Me? I want to go.
Whale sharks are so cool!
I'm not scared.
I can say hi to them again.
When they are eating...
They suck in everything.
I felt like I was going to get sucked in too.
The mouth is huge.
- Really? / - Yes.
(Is someone talking about my mouth?)
How was it?
- It was fun. / - Was it? Really?
Why am I so tired?
(Snorkeling with the whale sharks is over)
Wasn't that so much fun?
- Seriously. / - I want to try that.
- Awesome. / - Was it Alright?
Yes.
You were so tired just now.
I was really tired earlier.
- But now I feel so refreshed. / - Really?
- Wasn't it fun? / - Yes.
Next up,
I'll take you to an even more amazing place.
- More than this? / - Yes.
You'll love it.
Everyone loves that place.
We didn't get to take pictures.
Yeah. Let's go take some photos.
We were so busy looking at the whale sharks.
- Let's go. / - Let's go quickly.
Let's take a quick shower first.
(Conquering the nature in Oslob, Cebu)
(Tumalog Falls)
You can swim in Tumalog Falls.
- Tumalog Falls. / - She studied really hard.
Nami must've studied very hard.
It was an inspiration for "Avatar."
- Did it inspire "Avatar?" / - Yes.
(15 minutes by car to Tumalog Falls)
We saw the sea...
Now the waterfall.
This is the entrance to Tumalog Falls.
We can't get in with a car.
Then do we have to walk there?
Do you see motorbikes here?
We can get there with a motorbike.
The motorbikes are the transportation
to Tumalog Falls.
- I was very popular there. / - Shall we ask for a ride...
- And go to Tumalog Falls? / - Okay.
- I'm nervous. / - Just trust me and follow me.
- Okay. / - Hop on.
(Motorbike ride, $1)
Honey, let's go.
- It's only $1. / - They're available from 7 a.m...
- To 4 p.m. / - Let's go.
It looks like Sookyung is experienced with motorbikes.
She's holding the grip with only one hand.
- She's experienced. / - That one-handed grip.
Honey, let's go!
(3 minutes from the entrance to the falls)
I've never heard of this.
Many people don't know about this place.
Nami,
it would've been horrible if we walked all the way.
Are we already here?
- 47. / - 47?
- 47. / - Yes.
- They'll wait there. / - You remember the number.
- See you. / - See you.
I feel like I'm suddenly in a jungle.
Right? Look at that.
- Okay, go. / - Thank you.
Isn't this a ticket?
- Thank you. / - The entrance fee is 40 cents.
- Yes. / - I like that it's so cheap.
- Sookyung! / - It's really amazing.
- Sookyung! / - It's really amazing.
Hang on a second. This is insane.
I told you it'll be amazing.
- Their reactions are great. / - Sookyung is excited to...
Be outside of her home.
- I know. / - Everything is fascinating to her.
Sookyung is excited about everything.
- She is. / - It was really nice.
This makes the one who planned the trip so happy.
- It's amazing here. / - Hang on.
Hold on. It's amazing. Didn't I tell you that?
- Is it right there like that? / - Yes.
(Tumalog Falls is the biggest waterfall in Cebu)
(The falls is 100m high)
- The water falls from up there. / - It looks so cool.
- It's 100m high. / - 100m?
(There's one more special thing about this waterfall)
(The water is vivid emerald color)
- You can go into the water? / - Yes.
- That's amazing. / - We were there in the rainy season.
So there was quite a lot of water.
You have to go to Tumalog Falls in the rainy season.
- Sookyung, look at this. / - It looks awesome.
It's so cool, isn't it?
What is that?
Look at that color.
The color of the water is so beautiful.
Sookyung, this is the place that inspired "Avatar."
- This is the place? / - Yes.
- Really? / - It's based on this waterfall.
Even before Nami told me this,
as soon as I saw the falls,
I said it was just like in "Avatar."
- And it was actually related. / - Exactly.
Shall we go in as well?
I'm so cold.
Are you cold? Then you stay here. I'll go in.
- You can go in. / - Okay.
The water is ice cold.
(Nami goes into the water first)
(Excited)
It's so refreshing!
(She gets a waterfalls massage)
(Being under the waterfall reminds her of something)
(Training)
If you're a comedian...
That's a must.
Sookyung! It's so refreshing here.
Just trust me. Come here.
(She refuses)
But it's a waste not to go into such a beautiful place.
Sookyung, come on. Come here.
- Friend. / - Friend.
- Come down. / - Come down.
I asked them to say it.
(After much persuasion)
My goodness.
- My friend. / - She's coming.
- Friend. / - She's coming.
Friend, my friend. She's cold.
- Was it cold? / - The water was so cold.
It was really cold.
Sookyung, it's refreshing, isn't it?
(Sookyung and Nami had a lot of fun at the waterfall)
If it's like this, I'd love to jump in there.
It'd be amazing to be in cold water
in such a hot country.
It must be amazing.
(Nami is the most excited person)
I heard this is similar to
Cenote in Mexico, a natural swimming pool.
There's no need to go to Cancun.
- That's right. / - This is nearer.
- You can see whale sharks here too. / - Yes.
It's here! Don't come to me!
- Don't come to me! / - They're so cute.
- You have never done this? / - No.
- Really? / - Really.
Aren't they cute?
I've never seen doctor fish in nature.
There are so many. I must have so much dead skin.
I don't like being touched.
- Really? / - Yes.
I'll take what I can
since I never get touched.
This is amazing.
- They must've had a lot to feed on. / - They're here.
It tickles!
Sookyung's reaction is great.
(Great in reaction)
They were all firsts for me.
(Is it because she hasn't tried those things?)
(Sookyung and Nami have a relaxing time)
- They're having a party here. / - I know.
Now they're full,
shall we go eat something too?
- Sounds good. / - Let's go.
- Let's go eat something good. / - Okay.
A proper meal.
