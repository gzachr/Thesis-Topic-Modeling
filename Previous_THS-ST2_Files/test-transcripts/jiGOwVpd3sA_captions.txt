so it's a fun fact this is a philippine
product
and it's sold in australia they sold 20
millions of these in our
home country of austria 20 million it's
insane
good job yeah what is up guys welcome to
a brand new vlog
happy easter happy easter everyone it is
easter sunday
and today nelly and i are cooking up an
easter feast here at home but today
video coming soon
video coming soon but today we wanted to
film a special edition
of making it happen vlog because due to
the
increased cases especially in ncr plus
i think everybody needs to be as safe as
possible
one of the ideal ways to you know
improve the whole situation
is to do more and more testing so yeah
recently we got gifted
a at home antigen swap
test kit which we're going to try out
and review today here on the vlog this
is not
a sponsored post we literally just got
these sets gifted and thought we'd do it
on camera
um but this is the company that we're
going to be reviewing today
there you go it's the aria covert 19
antigen
test so as you can see here on the
packaging it says open
only upon scanning of the qr code and i
think the reason
why at least that is what i read here on
the back as soon as we scan this test
scan with qr code we get connected to a
nurse or doctor yeah so it's all
um online yes well besides the test
so there's some instructions here on the
back it says swap
drop weight sounds a little bit like
stop drop roll when you're on fire um
so yeah i think let's jump right into it
let's scan this qr code
pull this nose it says here on your nose
call this nurse and um do go
through the whole testing procedure
first off who's gonna do the test you or
me
um i'm going to do it or should we
okay okay okay yes that's a good idea
one
two three one two three
all right so you want you get to do it
all right so i have a little uh screen
recording up here on the phone
just going to scan this code here so
upon scanning this i get a notification
here
on my phone how can we let's focus this
on our eyes i open with zoom so this is
a zoom call
that actually gets done enter your name
i'll put in here nelly because it's
going to be you doing the test right now
no
you lost you you won you know
it's not how this works guys you have to
tell him
in the comments you won it's not who
wins so it's you
you won the test what should i say
okay obviously tricked me okay welcome
labx call a nurse personal meeting room
so
we're in kind of uh yeah here we're in
kind of a
waiting room a virtual waiting room
yeah and something that we found out is
that this test
actually is not the you know the classic
swap test where the swap goes all the
way
back here yeah it only goes to like half
of the nose i would say
and these tests were sold in austria
for the schools to reopen so all the
kids got
tested get tested with these uh so it's
a fun fact this is a
philippine product and it's sold in
australia they sold 20 millions of these
in
our home country of austria 20 million
it's insane good job yeah
so it says here on the back this product
contains one swab
one dilutant and dilutant caps
one test card and one instruction guide
read product information before use so
what i really like about it is that they
specifically tell you to scan the qr
code and get on a call before you open
it
it's sealed so as you can see they can't
really open it
yet so it says our nurses are engaged in
a call right now and we'll be with you
shortly
teletest dx service is available monday
to friday from eight a.m to five
p.m saturday and sunday 8 00 a.m to 5
p.m
so we'll put all the details of this in
the description box down below obviously
so you can check it out i think the cost
of one test kit
is don't quote me on the 700 pesos which
is far
less than what we've been paying for um
of course for pcr tests they're more
accurate and more expensive
uh but also we've tried an antigen test
and i think we paid 2
500. yes for an antigen test more
expensive
and that was a deep penetration swap
down like it was
it sounds horrible i hate talking about
it
what an awful word all right yeah and
for us i know
i don't know how it is for you but every
time i cough
or every time i feel a little bit under
the weather
i get this feeling of anxiety
and insecurity that i might
have it you know i think everybody can
relate
so you know for us it was just important
to get tested to
have that reassurance and confidence
that we are good that we are safe that
we are healthy
and mike and i are religiously
disinfecting our hands
uh on a like a thousand times a day
every time i go somewhere i have the
need to disinfect my hands
and we have had a lot of
swap tests already so we've had quite a
few pcr tests
um obviously because if we travel we
need a pcr test
if we attend an event you need a pcr
test which is good
but this is like just something for us
while we're at home to stay safe and to
have the reassurance that we are
not positive i guess yeah knock on wood
not so far good
[Music]

yourself you kind of
notice where to put it that it doesn't
hurt um
yeah so far so good
okay and while we're waiting we are
going to play a little bit with little
peanut because she seems to be in a
playful mood today
hi peanut hi peanut are you playing with
foxy
are you playing with foxy yeah we put
the blinds down
it's crazy hot so we don't want the
condo to be super hot peanut is cleaning
her little foxy
yes oh
it's so crazy to think that peanut was
as little as
foxy when we got here i got a picture i
can probably put it
[Music]
here
[Music]
do
okay the 15 minutes are up yeah i'm
calling my nurse again
[Music]
you mustn't forget we're not the only
one only once getting tested so
yeah but if we can go by this here it
looks like you're
negative yeah
so it comes with a whole
description yeah so even if you can't
reach anybody you
theoretically can do it by yourself as
well yeah oh
getting connected oh hi
uh i just i'm just trying to get
reconnected with my nurse i just
waited 15 minutes for the test um
[Music]
i'll do the reading of your test number
if you don't mind
okay um
you've done the test with nurse cecil as
i write uh
i'm not sure about the name but i think
so okay um can i see your test results
please
yes should i just pick it up or
yes you can pick it up already ma'am the
the agent is already uh
okay you're negative ma'am yes
congratulations
thank you so much only one kit that
you're using today
yes okay any questions that i can answer
ma'am um yeah what does this actually
mean because the antigen is different
from the pcr test
so what what is the meaning of the test
now what does it mean for me what does
it mean for others
okay for antigen test is basically um
a test for um how infectious you are or
the viral load of the body so the more
antigen you have in the body the more
infectious the person is
okay of which person can be asymptomatic
or can be symptomatic at the same time
it can be um detected by our antigen
tests
okay so um uh this is
best this kind of test is best used if
you are at home
in the safety of your home and to avoid
the spread of inspection
and to get uh to avoid um getting
infected as well
okay so you can do the test at home you
can do it on yourself or
all alone and have the privacy of
having yourself or remove the paranoia
of having contact uh coronal virus
okay you can have yourself tested every
day or every other day just to make sure
if you've been exposed to somebody who
has
been positive to go with 19. okay
okay perfect yeah thank you very much
this was very helpful
i find the test very um intuitive
this is actually like a high school
experiment actually
oh wow very interactive
at the same time yeah yeah i love it
also like talking to a specialist is
very nice so
you know just having the reassurance and
having questions answered
is really good for me all right thank
you so much
any other questions mom that i might be
able of uh
no just a big compliment and huge thank
you for doing this
thank you so much thank you take care
bye-bye happy easter
okay done
this was it's funny i keep telling you
stop being so negative
whoa oh no
yeah um i'm negative
all right guys yeah this is something
really cool to have at home and
um i'm sure we should get a few more of
these um
we'll put all the details in the
description box down below as i said
this is not sponsored in any way we did
get these gifted from a friend but
this is not a sponsored video exactly
we just we just thought this is a topic
that
is relevant with the current times and
especially now that we are in well
put it especially now that we are
currently in another lockdown
and mike and i are in the same room you
know it just
gets the stress out of your system that
you have like that paranoia that you
have
um to you know keep your keep yourself
safe keep others safe
so yeah yeah so yes and now uh
just a disclaimer we're not giving any
medical advice or anything else this is
just the
unbiased testing of this kit for us to
see it we'll get a few more of these and
have like
i don't know we can have ourselves
tested every other day
just to stay safe and to especially like
nearly said mentally
just because even if we're feeling well
you just want to make sure that you are
really well and that you're not
infectious
and that you're staying that just you're
doing your part in society so
it's good if you can then it's good to
do it anyway
