this and the dad was
H oh my God I'm
sorry so the last one would really make
you cry
because so jully be's idea of like
having this kind of commercials is
really really so great idea
I would like to thank him because
honestly love is the most prous thing
you we could ever feel
like just thinking that someone loves
you out there could make your day
already whenever you see the people you
love you are
already happy
and you don't have anything to worry
about it it's
that's why when you no like crash or
boyfriend it's any
problem you wouldn't even feel easy on
yourself who will feel uncomfortable
like there is something better in you
and stuff not waste your time or
anything just like look at the person
like love and tell them straight like
like that TR them like I love you okay
for the parents and grandparents
especially just keep on telling them how
much you love them every day like you
would wake up and tell your mom how much
you love
her or your grandmother or grandfather
because grandfather your
grandfather because you wouldn't
know what like life is hiding from you
spend most of the time with the people
you love do the things that you love and
if it's not okay it's not
the end it's always going to be a happy
ending for each one and I believe that
that guy in um V at
first he would end up with someone they
loved them because he deserves to be
loved because everyone deserves to be
loved you deserve to be loved and don't
think too much
about someone who rejected you you
deserve like you deserve the word and
you're beautiful you're handsome you're
amazing for the second one it's a great
story like never give up never ever give
up on the people you love and if you
think it's the one just don't stop
trying but the most most important thing
in all of this love yourselves guys if
you don't love yourself no one would
love you just love yourself love love
yourself so thank you everyone who
