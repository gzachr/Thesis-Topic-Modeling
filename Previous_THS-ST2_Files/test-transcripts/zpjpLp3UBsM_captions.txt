Gatsby market but the traffic and stuff

head straight to MoMA have a look in the
shopping mall and just see if there's
anything there that we can try
so we're currently at SM Mall over by
MOA we are heading off to find some food
I think not really sure the lane has
taught me to walk this way I won't say
why she's gonna keep it a secret thing
but I'm sure we good and we've got 45
minutes that until we have to meet up
with the two winners of the raffles for
the regime concert tonight and also to
meet our be friends as well to actually
get the tickets

Hey so we're at the I wouldn't call our
beach but we're at the sea area

big wheel across there which we might go
on if we're feeling brave nothing is too
high but it's once you in it you in it
and I've been told but it's gonna come
and if it doesn't I'm gonna kill her

telling me for ages that it's rainy
season but expected to be it that's a
very least cloudy and so far the
weather's been great I mean yesterday
morning we had a bit of drizzle but that
was really early on and then after that
it's been fine but yeah I'm absolutely
baking I say it was about as hot as it
was when I went in Rome see if people

together on Kenda tree so the lanes

she's doing all the calls for me and
making sure what everyone's going to be
where they need to be and we've got
about 20 minutes or so before we have to
meet the two winners of the raffle so
they can claim there are 30 tickets

get the tickets because I'd hate to keep
them waiting and then they just don't
give us the tickets at all so we run
