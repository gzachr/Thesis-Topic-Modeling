veda i am your host ovina and i reacted
last week to the interview between
bongbong marcos and tony gonzaga
um
that interview according to a lot of
people shed a positive light on the
marcos's family
and so
a lot of you are asking me to also react
to a video
uh that talks about the other side of
the coin if you will because you guys
realize that
uh my
channel has a wide reach you know and
that it could influence people even
though even though that is definitely
not my intention you know when i react
to videos i'm not here to
influence or even
promote anything okay
and so a lot of you have been sending me
videos that criticize the marcoses and
are asking me to react to those videos
but most of them are extremely long even
though there are a couple that looked
very interesting and they're called a
witness to history if i find time i
might react to them and if you're really
interested like this video so that i can
actually react to those two okay but
today we are reacting to a video that
was uploaded by abs-cbn called life
under marcos a fast check this one is
much shorter and i'm pretty sure that
i'm gonna learn a lot from it but before
we start please consider follow me on
instagram at music game news and without
further ado let's get to it
life under the marcos a fact check
[Music]
was the late dictator ferdinand marcos
the philippines greatest president ever
as his supporters claim
[Music]
here is life under the marcos regime
[Music]
ferdinand marcos ruled as philippine
president for
21 years that is a very very long time
and guess what guys i can actually
relate to you 100 percent
because algeria also
had a president
recently that
also
stayed
at the top of the government for over 20
years and his name was
buddha
from 65 to 86 so a year before i was
born
[Music]
limited by the 1935 constitution to two
terms uh yeah he declared martial law to
accept see i hate this i hate when uh
you know the president does this just
because he wants to stay in power for a
longer period of time so stupid he
declared martial law to extend his
of role this month
i signed
proclamation number 1081 placing the
entire philippines under martial law
that's not cool man that's definitely
not cool
claiming that the country was threatened
by communist and moral rebels okay
he then had a new constitution created
allowing him to stay longer in power
certain sectors say the philippines was
rich under marcos his effect here's a
fact check on life under the marcos
regime
okay
claim marcos improved filipinos
lives
[Music]
the poverty rate when he first took
office in 65 was 41
which is very high man still
it was 58.9
in 85 before he was ousted so a clear
increase you know of
almost 20
almost it's 17 i think
[Music]
yeah that's bad
[Music]
claim the peso us dollar rate was uh one
peso to one us dollar under marcos
that's the claim
[Music]
that's
dude if that were the case that's
amazing
peso us dollar rate and 65 was 3.9 pesos
to one dollar
it reached 6.7 to 1.72
use
that is just bad
20.4 to 1 in 86
the value of the pesos just went down
wow
it crumbled
oh that's really really bad
alright the claim the philippines was
rich under marcos
[Music]
in his first year in office the nation's
gdp per capita was 257
okay
[Music]
it fell to
244 in his second term it was 214 during
martial law
wow
so in 86
[Music]
international monetary funds philip
gerson says only marcus's croonies got
rich during his rule yeah so corruption
the rich got richer while the poor got
poor oh goodness it'll never stop
[Music]
claim marcos was not corrupt well
what we just read proves that he was you
know
if the if under his rule you know
because they call him dictator
um
the rich got richer and the poor got
poorer it means that he was corrupt
or that
his
people you know the people he was
working with were corrupt
oh my goodness forbes lists marcos as
the world's second top most corrupt
leader in history he is estimated to
have stolen around 10 billion dollars oh
goodness gracious
and i know that uh at the end of this
video in the comment section below
there'll be the people who are for
uh the marcuses they will go into the
comment section and they will claim that
all of these facts are not true
and they even claimed that uh what i
read on wikipedia in my first video was
false and that
you know
people just change
reality you know stuff like that so i
honestly don't know what to believe i
mean if
they are saying that these are facts
then maybe they are i don't know
but 10 billion dollars dude that is too
much
why why would you steal 10 billion
dollars what what are you gonna do with
10 billion dollars
it's insane
how
you cannot be a decent human being
by stealing this much money
when you can clearly see that there are
people that need
some
a fraction of that money you know you
just can't
[Music]
marcos was indicted in the us in 1988
for racketeering he is accused of
stealing more than a hundred million
dollars to buy buildings in new york
he died a year later before any verdict
was handed out
claim life was peaceful under the marcos
according to some who didn't live during
martial law yeah i saw a lot of that in
the comment section a lot of uh
a lot of people were writing that
their grandmothers or their grandfathers
who lived under
uh the marcos's
claim that life was peaceful
at least
3257 people were killed
thirty-five thousand others were
tortured
seventy thousand political prisoners
were jailed during demarcus's years
seventy thousand
dude
that number is just ex
extreme like 70 000 is is a lot
marcos declared so a claim marcos
declared martial law to enforce law and
order
well he declared martial law to
continue his reign over the philippines
[Music]
there you go he declared martial a lot
to extend his rule and made a new
constitution to stay longer in power
from only a handful in 1969 npa rebels
reached 25 000 during his regime because
of rights abuses and worsening
socio-economic situation in the country
claim media reported good news during
the marcus's rule
you know they should have put like claim
you know and then
fact
newspapers televisions and stations were
shut down during the demarcus regime
those allowed to operate had government
sensors in newsrooms
claim marcos built roads buildings
bridges
marcos used government money not his own
the philippines foreign debt was 1
billion in 65
so i'm guessing it went considerably you
know uh high
later on
it oh my god it reached 28 billion
dollars just before he fled
oh my goodness goodness gracious
[Music]
marcos so this is a claim marcos was a
hero before becoming president yeah
that's true because he was uh a military
man
a u.s military investigation showed
marcos didn't lead geria troops against
the japanese
he supposed he supposed warm metals were
also fake uh okay the guy who was
talking okay
damn
but how can we be sure of all this you
know what i mean
no i mean just that one is that a fact
you know i don't know
claim the marcuses were rich before he
became president
[Music]
marcos was not born rich his father was
a lawyer politician in the province
allegedly killed by philippine troops
for being a japanese collaborator during
the war
well i mean if the father was a lawyer
politician it
more likely means that they had money
right
claim marcos made wealth from gold taken
from the japanese
[Music]
former bsp governor
gabriel singson said it is impossible
for the marcosus to have had
4 000 tons of gold as
imelda once claimed in a newspaper
4 000 tons bro
the banco central ng pilipinas only had
650 tons of gold reserves during the
marcus years
i see
when the marcos has fled to hawaii
u.s customs inspectors found around 300
crates filled with jewelry gold as well
as 1500 documents described by the u.s
lawmakers steven solars as an
encyclopedia of corruption
yikes
the documents include a marcos memo to
the pnb that order transfer of 20
million pesos to him a list of expenses
for imelda's overseas trips
uh imelda is probably his wife right
a memo showing deposits and interest in
overseas banks amounting to 30 million
dollars around
11 2
million dollars in commissions from
westing house
a listing of precious gems deposit
certificates and barrier bonds worth
four million dollars as well as stock
transfer deeds bank documents financial
information about hotels and payments
made directly to the former dictator and
his wife for disaster relief projects
dude put all this money together
like
40 41.2
plus four so
45.2 million dollars
i'm not even counting the 20 million
uh pesos
i don't know how much that is in in
dollars that's a lot of money bro
these are the sources by the way
new york times forms magazine
but are these sources viable you know
can you trust these sources
text by jojo maliga
okay people okay okay we well i've
learned a lot of things uh about the
marcus's family through this video uh
let me know in the comment section below
if you've learned a few things as well
if if all of this is true then it's
terrible i'm sorry but it's just
terrible but
like do like i saw in the comment
section of my previous video of the
interview between bong bong and tony
gonzaga
uh
it's very
it's split it splits i feel right in the
middle you know some people are for him
some people believe this and some people
don't so
i don't know what to believe
because here they're saying facts
they're facts abs-cbn is saying that
these are facts like they're sure
that this is the truth
if this is the truth then it's terrible
to be honest i lean more towards these
facts because
in algeria we lived somewhat a similar
situation with our former president
abdel aziz bhuttaflica okay so he stayed
in power for over 20 years he wasn't
supposed to
but he did
and uh
there was a lot of corruption you know
in the in the country and in the
government during his uh
regime if you will
so a lot of money was stolen and just
but the thing is the thing is
i'm pretty sure that
uh
ferdinand marcos even though he might
have been a maybe a bad or terrible
president i'm pretty sure that he still
did good you know just like our former
president abdel aziz bhutahlir you know
not everything was bad
because i remember before he became
president there was terrorism in our
country okay and it was ravaging the
country it was very bad
so he became president and he fixed that
situation you know he eradicated uh
terrorism
but with time you know
he remained in in power for too long and
you know corruption came and
things got worse again
so
it's not
black or white you know it's shades of
gray so i'm pretty sure that
our former president did some good and
some bad and i'm pretty sure that
ferdinand marcos
as well you know he did some good but he
did some bad
obviously we would want the good to
outweigh the bad
so
i don't know in this case if
you know with the ferdinand if the the
good outweighs the bad from these facts
i don't think so
and for our president
i think it came from a good intention
you know i think his first intentions
were very uh
noble and you know positive
but in the long run in the long term
i believe that he did more bad than good
i don't know to be honest i'm not very
politically
inclined you know i don't care much
about politics
so i'm not really in a very good
position to really share my my opinion
on these things i need to learn more you
know to give a proper opinion on things
so whatever i shared with you guys today
is based on
the videos that i reacted to and that's
it you know
um so there you go let me know in the
comment section below your thoughts on
uh these facts and this video and you
know the marcus's family but
thank you so much for joining me um yeah
so take care of yourselves have a great
day stay safe and i will see you in the
next one peace
