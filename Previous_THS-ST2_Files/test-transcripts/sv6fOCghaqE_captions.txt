bro this is a legendary episode
[Music]
and welcome back to mgnd ago
vela and i have chosen this particular
video to start
testing my new layout for reaction
videos that are related to
music okay so for my
patrons they don't have to worry about
anything
and then nothing basically will change
for them they will see the reaction
video as
is you know with the actual reaction you
know with the actual
uh vocal performances or music video or
whatever okay but for my uh
youtube subscribers things will change
so basically
the video will consist of me giving you
a rundown of what i saw with a few
snippets here
and there if possible okay
so that's how it's going to be and
uh so the video of today is called the
voice teams philippines battle
round chrissy versus micah
ave
this is going to be amazing but before
we start please consider follow me on
instagram
music game news and of course i'd like
to thank my dear patrons for their
amazing support where they get to enjoy
the entire reaction video yes and do not
hesitate to tell me in the comment
section below
if you enjoy this new layout
i know you don't get to actually watch
the the reaction video but it is what it
is things have to change because of the
youtube copyright claims okay
um so yeah i am waiting for your
feedback
all right let's start watching
oh my god this was an
epic legendary episode and i'm about to
summarize it
right now so what did we just see
okay so we had christy and micah
basically singing together slash
battling the ave maria
song and their coach was
um leah salonga okay so
they both sang it beautifully but
but in my opinion micah or mika
uh was given the most interesting part
of the song
you know she started singing opera
beautifully in german
you know it was really really
beautifully done and it was beautiful to
hear
but christy sang the english parts also
very well you know and then
um the transition to the harmony between
the girls
was gorgeous beautifully done no false
notes you know it was very impressive
because the entire beginning of the song
they each had their parts and then they
beautifully transitioned together
and then christy also
sang in opera a little bit you know i
was like huh
christy can do it too so why was
micah given all the best parts of the
song you know what i mean
so i thought that was a little bit
unfair unfortunately
oh i really would love to listen to this
with the
rose inversed you know reversed because
i think christie could sing as well as
micah if she wanted to but you know uh
you know if i base my opinion on what i
just saw
yes i would choose micah okay
so and then and then all the judges
went with micah they all chose micah
you know coach bamboo coach sarah coach
leah
and uh shannon right sharon shannon
they all went with micah but you know as
soon as the assalonga was like micah she
was like
brah you better steal christy she is
very
uh worth stealing you know and you know
it's lea salonga if lea
salonga says it it means that you know
you better do it so guess what
this was a legendary episode because all
of the other coaches pressed on the red
button to steal christy uh-huh
and apparently uh shannon or sharon
she had the best case you know so
christy went
with shannon or sharon i i'm sorry i
don't remember if it's shannon or sharon
basically she didn't go with the bamboo
nor
um uh sarah g okay
but man you guys were so right this was
an epic
uh
wow
that was so impressive gotta be my khan
kristi you
battle i had so much fun
uh reacting to this and i really hope
that
i am able to uh vehicle
my reaction and my emotion to you guys
my youtube subscribers even though you
can't
uh watch the reaction video because of
copyright claims
but for my patrons man you get to enjoy
the entire thing
i was blown the hell away
this was awesome i cannot wait i waited
this long
to react to this and i believe i reacted
to micah
before i do think i reacted to one of
her performances because
she looks very familiar and sounds
familiar
