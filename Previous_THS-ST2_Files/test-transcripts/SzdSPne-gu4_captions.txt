Clear skies, clouds, not so hot today. So.. I think it's gonna go well.
Rhoda is here!
She just arrived.
What did you bring Rhoda?
I brought some floaties.
Have you met the students before Rhoda?
No I haven't.
And I only met GN Tech. I don't know the students so we'll see how they are.
Like...it's been so long since we actually did a tour. I guess?
It has been a 40 minute drive down here at Inarajan beach. So we're finally here.. just turning in.
So it looks pretty creepy.
Because if you look here it is an abandoned apartment.
Yeah.
So we are actually going through ummm
a pathway here.
We arrived at the beach.
So here I'm actually going to show you the view.
The view is very
Scenic
Right here, this is the other side of the beach.
Looks pretty cool right now.
Actually here there is like a back side
Where the water actually gets deeper.
What time did you wake up Geena?
Like 5:45 am. 5:45 AM!
How about Micahela? What time did you wake up? I woke up at like 8:15 am.
8:15 am HAHAHAHAHA
We are actually gonna go and pick up the students right now.
They're heading here already.
The bus is arriving soon.
So they are probably wondering...like oh my god..why are we here. There's like an abandoned apartment.
I thought we were going to the beach.
I remember before we had students who um came
And they're like... Erickson are you sure we are at the right spot?
It's so scary it is like a horror movie.
Did you guys ever liked?
Bring them into the jungle OMG!
Did you guys ever actually like play with them and try and make them walk in?
No.
We are not that cruel.
We are not that curel. We are very nice to the students.
