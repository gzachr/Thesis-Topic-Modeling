you
uh read on the paper and i'm going to
take care of my plants now
and water them and spray them and just
talk to them they grew really really
nicely i have a few here
i water the small plants next to the
sink and then i have
then i have this little water spray
and give them a little shower
so i'm basically simulating rain for the
plants because they're indoors
i'm so so happy with the plants right
now
this one likes it here and there's so
many so many little new things coming
out
here and here here
and here a little peanut
loves this spot this one is also growing
really really nicely as you can see
there are so many new leaves here
and a while ago i posted on instagram
that this leaf
this is a new leaf was tiny like this
tiny
and now it's fully grown and i really
love this plant it looks
it almost looks like a fake plant looks
like plastic but it's
[Music]
such a really
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
okay here's another gem that i want to
show you i
we got a record from a viewer
um i have no idea how to
spell this i don't know what this oh i
think it's this way
let me know in the comments down below
if if this is familiar to you
um we haven't listened to it yet it's
filipino music
so i'm really really excited to get a
sneak peek
um we have a record player as you guys
know
and um yeah
can't wait to dig into filipino music
this is by the way from
a record store here in makati it's
called
this is pop and it's so funny because
the owner reached out to us
via email saying he watches our vlogs
and um he wants to send us a record
no he said he wants to send us a little
appreciation gift
and i had no idea and uh i figured out
it's it's the same store that i wanted
to go to
actually i found it on the internet when
i researched cool when i researched
cool spots in makati so yeah i
still haven't figured out what the name
of this is
oh it's ud ud
yeah cool okay can't wait to listen to
it
just wanted to say thank you so much for
this i really appreciate it
and something that is very very
interesting for me
is to see that a lot of people here in
the philippines
are self-employed and have their own
small business
and that's not so common in austria in
austria you more or less
uh scared to open your open up your own
business
there are not that many small businesses
like here in the philippines i
really really admire
the courage to start your own business
uh during the pandemic
and also those who still have their
business running
uh despite all the all the crazy changes
that we have been through
all the mcm ecq and
ecq and gcq i don't know um
i know it's really really tough on the
soul
it's really difficult when you don't
have the money to pay the rent or your
employees and i know a lot of people who
are just holding on to their employees
and
paying them first just to make sure that
nobody
loses a job so big thumbs up big thumbs
up for all the small businesses and if
you can afford
to support them please go to your
favorite coffee shop
go to your order from your friend order
some food from your friends
or just ask them how you can help me
maybe share the business on facebook or
instagram you don't have to buy but you
can help them promote their business
um i know it's a really really tough
time and um
yeah i just wanted to say it's not
unseen
i can relate oh mike and i can relate
in so many points because we were small
business owners and we
also had some struggles in the past and
uh
yeah it can be tough especially on this
also
please please stay positive this too
shall pass and better times will come
that's just something that i wanted to
let off let go of my heart because i
just
felt like it today and yeah now
if you want to join me for a little
clean up here
in the uh office please do so
um i also have something for you in a
few seconds
i just want to get rid of something and
maybe some of you guys want to have it
okay when i talk about mess i mean this
mess
and this it's all unorganized and
we need to find a way to sort this out
so
um guys if you know any shops
for organizing things
for i don't know boxes or whatever
uh let me know in the comments down
below better better uh send me a message
on instagram
either to mike or me uh at nelly's life
underline
analyn or my oh making it happen vlog
uh because this this needs to go
yeah as you can see it is a headache
to go through these things
and just sort it out so
i tried to arrange boxes just to
have certain things in boxes
but we make the huge mistake that we
never put things back where they belong
so we need to learn that
so we don't have to look for things for
a very long time which results into
a little bit yeah
which results in discussions couple
discussions
maybe you can relate
okay so i didn't know you were gonna
vlog me
[Laughter]
we need to talk about about this
about camera gear yeah yes uh
i think we should let go some things
we need to reset
yeah clear out some things we have uh
some stuff that needs to go and some new
stuff that needs to come
yeah i agree okay so should we just uh
take all the things that we want to sell
yes there are a few items that we want
to sell
um there's just a few items that need to
be chucked out but
yeah every now and then you need a reset
we've been doing like daily videos for
almost two
for over two years now yeah and um
yeah and uh you know there's a lot of
equipment lots of gimbals here
yes i have never seen anybody
with as many gimbals it's not it's not
even all gimbals
should we should we try the carous
carousel
app yeah we can should we sell it on
instagram
yeah i mean we can uh we can put it on
carousel and share it on instagram
yeah okay yeah sounds good
okay here a few things that we are
selling
this is a really really good photo
camera it's a canon 6d
i haven't really used it in i would say
one and a half years still working
perfectly but we just
do everything on the vlogging cam right
now
we also have an old sony we have some
gopros we have some batteries we have
gimbals we have 360 cameras
we have lenses we have gopro equipment
that we're not using so i think i'll put
everything on one page i think we're
going to use
carousel i think it's called um and
we'll just announce on instagram
we if you're interested where you can
buy the things that you need or want and
i'm also going to add some of my items
might be some decorational items and
maybe
some stuff that i have that i'm not
using or have never used
in actual fact um but yeah we're going
to sell a few things just because we
want to make
space uh declutter and also
with we're currently saving up for a new
laptop
mike needs a new laptop as you guys uh
realized over the past few vlogs
his frustration level has reached the
uppermost levels we're just uh going to
buy a new one so
he doesn't have to be annoyed when he
edits a vlog anymore
but one thing is for sure it's not going
to be an apple okay
all right clearly we all know who
decides what happens
in a day
hello oh look how she sat up for the
camera
such a good girl
there you go um yeah today has been
quite the laid back day
honestly i have been so sore the last
two days because i've been also working
out
and it's been a long time since walking
out so my muscles just went into like
overkill mode so very very sick i think
our muscles went into lockdown oh yeah
but
i hope you enjoyed the vlog nonetheless
um
you know chill days are just something
that's going to be part of the vlog
during quarantine
we had a very relaxed sunday where we
didn't do any work whatsoever which is a
change for us
which was really nice and yeah i got to
lay back today nearly edited this vlog
nearly filmed most of the vlogs so i'm
pretty chill today
uh i'll be taking over the steering
wheel in tomorrow's vlog again
anyway guys i hope you enjoyed the time
spent with us
i hope you are having a peanut and
peanut
and we'll see you guys tomorrow
