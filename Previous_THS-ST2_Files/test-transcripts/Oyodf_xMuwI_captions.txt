I went to the wrong one this is ours so
every November 1st instead of like going
around and getting trick-or-treating we
actually come here this is so cool that
like people are actually just
just entering hello world wake me up to
another good good morning time to go
[Music]
welcome to the Vlog today is November
1st which is
and we're gonna go visit some relatives
Graves I've learned my lesson every time
we go to the cemetery we get bug bites
so we're gonna layer this on us and
foreign
[Music]
and John has two relatives here right
one grandparent and two
[Music]
um
this is so cool that like people are
actually just hanging out in the
cemetery John has explained this to me
before I've definitely heard about it
but to be here and to experience it
very different it's unlike anything that
I've ever imagined everyone's just
eating it out yep actually having like a
picnic on top of the Grave why didn't we
bring snacks
so I'm not used to this side of the
cemetery I normally go to the other
entrance but I think we can go this way
let's do it
[Music]
it's so clean now like we were running
through here from the bugs before yep
the thick weeds
I went to the wrong one this is ours so
this is Mama Lola's grandparents
all the way there
just right there yep
record them they're going to ask you
something okay
everyone first instead of like going
around and getting trick or treat we
actually come here and we pay respect
for our
um to our Lolo and Lola so this one is
grandfather he died before his wife he
was here first and then when his wife
died then they opened the thing cleaned
it up and then put her in as well
with that man
I'm just bones and stuff now
foreign
nope
where'd they do the standing love
that's where we're going
[Music]
so this is
[Music]
a beer
my name is Eli one of your grandson I
think we'll have to come back later so
we can come and like actually clean and
scrub the stool because it's it's pretty
messy
like when I was young
I would actually go around here we're
gonna stay here all day all all until
late in the evening
and then I'm gonna collect all those uh
those uh candle drips right there
and then I'm gonna make my own candle
and then I'm gonna put it in
um in my Lola Stone
is that really what you do yeah that's
what we do to like be able to have more
candles that is so adorable
so I think we just found out that John
has more relatives that we're supposed
to visit so we're getting more candles
getting a machete and we're gonna go
clean up the grave some more
light more candles for all of them it's
very busy out there so we are gonna
leave our car here and walk to the
cemetery well since it started raining
we're gonna leave the kids with Pixies
and so we can just go get this done oh
my it's really raining outside here we
go
foreign
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
[Music]
he's so cute
[Music]
yes
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
I'm here
bye
I just said hi
I'm awkward I said hi
sorry
so she is supposed to be one of my
batchmates yeah totally forgot who she
is you didn't even introduce me yeah
I was as awkward as you are so cute
we are very awkward people she was
waving goodbye and I said hi
it's such a weirdo
[Music]
it's awesome because
everybody is staring at Laura right now
it's normal but you really notice it
when you're in a big crowd in a
situation like this it's kind of
uncomfortable but I love it we know
we're going through a different Cemetery
one that I haven't been because I guess
we have some other relatives here that I
didn't know that
they're here
[Music]
my umbrella just broke no it's okay
okay today was exactly one of those days
that I came to the Philippines for to
teach my kids these Filipino traditions
and it was really important to us that
we took them to the cemetery and I'm
glad that we got to do that before the
rain and all of that rush around to the
different Graves later but I'm grateful
for the experience to understand a bit
more of the culture and and how much
Filipinos are so connected as families
and I think that's very cool it's
important to honor the people that have
come before us so I enjoyed my first
undas and it was really good for us so
for the comment of the day I'm gonna go
to the video when John said why I don't
speak Tagalog at the time of recording
