welcome
back to music game news
i am your host overlap and yesterday we
reacted to the
tnt jurados and it was one hell of a
video it was hilarious
and i made it even
funnier because i finally
figured out a filter that allowed the
video to be published on youtube without
it being blocked right
but the only filter that i could find
was the fisheye filter which deforms a
little bit
uh the image right it made you guys
laugh it made me laugh i thought it was
very fitting okay you guys are saying
that i should just
blur the image but i'm not sure which is
better
an image that's blurry or an image where
you can actually
see the video just a little bit
distorted right
i'm gonna keep it uh distorted for now
and i will have to try the blurry image
because i
trust me yesterday i must have spent two
hours
trying different effects and seeing uh
if
youtube would block my videos and the
only one that
did not get blocked was the one with the
fisheye effect
and another one without the video just
the audio okay
so um i've decided today to
react to another tawang nangtang
video it's a short one but it is time to
react to it okay
um we've been reacting to a lot of gigi
diana
videos you know her uh performance
with her performances with her team
members right
and you know she's doing a great job but
you guys kept telling me that
she was discovered on tawaga nangtang
halen
okay and i have never reacted to one of
her performances on the show
so of the i've decided to react to her
performance of arau gabi
uh ontar and the name you know
on the title is mary gidget
de la but now we all know her as
gigi uh it's a short video
and hopefully all right hopefully the
technique of the fish eye will allow me
to publish this on youtube if
you know if it gets blocked and i kind
and i can't find a way i will have to
only show you snippets but hopefully you
know fingers crossed i'll be able to
publish it without any
issues uh but before we start please
consider follow me on instagram
at music game news and without further
ado
let's check it out
[Music]
she's from luzon
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
sorry sorry i did not mean to to say
what i was about to say okay
what the hell she does not look the same
i mean she's clearly younger here so i'm
wondering when
this took place 2016.
this is the year the channel mgm music
game news was created
holy moly it's been a minute so yeah she
looks
younger but she also looks different
i think she redid her nose her nose now
looks a lot thinner what is
man it's it's normal it's normal in the
philippine it's like uh
it's part of their tradition now you
know when you become famous
boom you have to change your face you
have to go through
uh surgery this is crazy this is a
different nose this is a different nose
man
and you know now her eyebrows are also a
little thinner
you know wow
hey i love it i love it she is telling a
story the way she's singing it it's
she's not showing off you know it's
coming from the heart
you know it's that part
[Music]
[Music]
is there she is
yang man yang has been part of the tnt
judges for a very long time eh
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
hey very nice so
if i'm not mistaken this is a regina
velasquez
song that was written by her husband
ogie al-qasid if
my memory serves me correctly
[Music]
[Laughter]
oh my god the dude looks so
bored it feels like he hasn't touched
the gong in forever you know which
shows how good filipinos are you know
because
this dude's job is to hit the gunk to
eliminate
a contestant right if they don't sing
well
he is either sleepy okay
or he is mesmerized by gigi
one of the two
i love his face he's like oh
[Music]
she has an rnb voice
[Music]
who just went and hugged gg
very nice very nice you know with this
performance i can actually
place her voice in a genre i really feel
like her voice really
is suits the r b genre okay
or it's more like the r b genre suits
uh gigi's voice um
you know it was not out of this world
right the performance but it just felt
it was heartfelt
you know i felt like she
believed every word she was singing you
know
she wasn't really trying to impress us
with
the the power you know or the belting
no no no it was more about
the the feelings the intricacies of the
song you know even
even if i can't understand what she was
saying because it was a filipino
somehow i was moved by the performance
i wasn't wowed by it you know because
like i said she wasn't trying to impress
us with her vocal
ability she wasn't trying to show off
she was trying
to connect that's what i felt all right
and i think she did a great job
uh but yeah i'm still really
shocked by uh her physical evolution
if you will you know she looks different
she looked like a kid here you know now
she looks like a woman
that knows what she's doing and knows
what she wants all right
so wow what a transformation
