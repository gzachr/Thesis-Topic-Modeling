video this jitbler guy
jiggler you mean hitler uh yeah he's
like hitler
his his his views and a lot of people
have been telling us to react to him
right
uh we already know like kind of what it
is but yeah we wanted to
translate because um you know a lot a
lot of comments there and his videos
doesn't know what he's saying he doesn't
know english
so what we did was uh we're gonna
translate um
the first video we're gonna watch this
video the the really famous one the most
viewed one
hundred twenty thousand views maybe i'm
a korean he's uh he's a very uh i don't
think he's crazy he's very i think he's
north korea no he's not north korea he
hates north korea
ah so he's really south korea yeah but
he's a he has a wrong
he's a super leftist he has the wrong i
think he's right by the way
super right he has a wrong uh idea of
what patriotism yeah what everything is
so let's see what he did
this and then uh yeah the high
philippines i'm a korean this this is
like
so crazy [ __ ] and we'll tell you guys
what this
okay
you really spit on that [ __ ]
[ __ ] but not even like the right
flag that's what you're saying
you know the first time i saw this i'm
not gonna lie
i was really really pissed off like
like really angry
and i don't like myself when i get angry
i think he has some mental problems
he looks like he's serious though you
know
[Music]
why would you do that he started a very
big
issue again you know it was kind of
going down
so basically this is what this is what
you call a troll internet troll this
[ __ ] is called an internet
[ __ ] troll
because of this [ __ ] i see he threw
it on the camera huh
this is the funny part so you have to
make it again i guess right so you have
to make two flags
ah he drew that yeah yeah he drew it did
you have a printer
he stepped on the flag
but it's like kind of like you know
[Music]
okay this this video itself
uh in my opinion after you know the bell
porch thing right
it was going down everyone was
apologizing let's be you know like let's
let's
let's not make this kind of thing happen
he kind of sparked
another uh another conflict
let's just say controversy yeah and
because of this
now there's some filipinos who are like
you know burning and ripping the flag
of korea and other stupid koreans who
are
doing the same but um i was just so
shocked i was so i was i was speechless
guys i was like what the [ __ ]
i was like oh my god this guy needs some
some spanking bruh
this guy needs this guy needs some i
read like somewhere like he's from
mental hospital or something but doesn't
matter like
it it just really and a lot of koreans
living in the philippines are kind of
scared
uh really some of them i heard like for
their like safety and stuff
and also like you know the filipinos in
korea if you meet someone like this
like it's like what the [ __ ] like what
are you gonna do right
so and and that that kind of made me uh
wanna kind of see like what the hell is
this guy like trying to
to say right um what do you first take
when you saw this video
i was pissed i wanted to like really
[ __ ] him up like
say to him i think
like what you said you should not spread
you should not like spread hate with
hate
yeah when he did that yeah i just
realized okay
he's a troll he's a troll yeah just i
don't i don't want to go down on this
level
basically like he did that okay yeah
then it's like
i don't want to fight hate with hate you
gotta fight hate with love right
so that's true so like you know like
of course like i want to kill him but
like you can't do that because i'm gonna
go to jail and [ __ ] right but
he's gonna fight with love so right yeah
and then the
filipino didn't burn the korean flag
they they were like trying to
like tear it i saw some video but
they're like oops
really i didn't see the burn one but
yeah most of the filipinos they do like
oops you know like they say like love
because of these stupid idiots
um like this guy um he he uh
he he makes it really like a stupid like
and that's just causes stupidity you
know it just causes stupid unwanted like
conflict you know like
like koreans live in the philippines you
know like they're scared right now bro
it's not good but
it doesn't mean this guy generalizes all
koreans right of course this is just
like
zero point zero zero zero one percent
off like just one guy one stupid one
he wants to like you know maybe be
famous if he goes to phil maybe he wants
me i think he's gonna get killed
like seriously if he goes to he can't
i'm like really scared of this guy
he should be aware of what he's doing
for sure and then he makes the
philippines bella porch dance video
version which he dances which is useless
stupid [ __ ]
and you guys can see that which has no
korean because he can't speak english
right the next one five days ago he
says something jitter philippine cookies
before the i would not apologize so this
is the first one before that
so we're gonna translate all these
videos so you guys can uh understand
understand what would that what's this
[ __ ] like what's [ __ ]
thinking right and so you're saying
like logically [ __ ] him up and then you
know if he said something wrong sue him
or
[ __ ] him up because i i i want to like
really [ __ ] him up sometimes
but uh yeah so we're gonna check this
out uh the translation by me it's not
like a hundred percent but i tried my
best as a korean and
uh philip uh english guy to to do it
so he says
he is saying what he thinks about this
um
issue is his stance on this uh
philippine
high-end philippine korean video that he
did right so um here goes the
translation hope you guys uh like it and
if
you wanna me to translate anything else
he said uh let me let me know
[Music]
um
um
[Music]
um
tiger he loves the tiger and he loves
referencing the tiger guys
we're strong tigers
just [ __ ] say even if we're wrong we
gotta push it
that's the real strong country though
the past war he likes that like colony
the rulership
imperialism total control
who wants to call him he's serious
the ancestors
it's bad
[Music]
foreign
foreign
[Music]
foreign
foreign
[Music]
is

[Music]
hospital huh he had him he has some
points right like why he's weak that
what's his points
yeah but he's points like stupid so
there's no need to explain
like he's just saying trash [ __ ] like
what are his points though
there's no point no no like he has some
points like why is he doing that
because he's patriotic but that's not
how you should show your picture
distance it's just stupid like what he
says
what do you say he's like saying korea
has to like
not look down yeah but like that doesn't
make sense though but like i don't know
yeah so i have no comments basically
he's just stupid she's a stupid guy you
know just like ranting and [ __ ]
she's basically stupid guy he's he's
saying that
uh korea should rule like uh other like
poor countries and whatever
go to war and win and show the
strongness and bow down and like
not germany before not accept not accept
apologies like japan before not accept
apologies
for korea and
and just like keep pushing even if
you're wrong keep pushing the wrong and
[ __ ] them over
and like win and not bow down and show
the strongest that's why
when the teleport should happen he he
didn't like the whole i guess canceled
curry apologize he didn't understand why
koreans are apologizing and stuff
and really decided to go extreme and
he's it's very extreme
uh he has a very uh serious
some problems uh very big problem
so for me i think i will
you know give him some medication he
needs some uh
he needs some good old spanking
i need some like bam i need some
wake up [ __ ] that kind of [ __ ] but
because because of him there's a
tremendous
uh it's not even a joke bros because of
this [ __ ] do you think it's
funny and [ __ ] like the memes and stuff
i saw right
it's funny and stuff but this guy is
really
uh this what he did is really bringing
waves of really
uh negative uh effects
on some koreans and filipinos who view
koreans and
philippines you know what i mean
especially the koreans living in the
philippines and maybe even the filipinos
living in korea
they're like of course you know most
koreans i think 99
90 are like you know whatever this guy's
done whatever dumb [ __ ] they love
philippines right but
there are some koreans like like like
him you know who who are
like [ __ ] up like who are really
thinking lowly and
you're thinking of bad stuff filipinos
and you don't want to meet these guys
out
in the streets and stuff right um we got
to take care of this
you know i really think we someone has
to i mean
just like we gotta make sure that this
kind of thing is not
okay i think um and really um
send him a message and like [ __ ] like
if he needs to
if what he did was punishable by the law
he needs to get punished you don't mean
it's not just simple it's not just a
simple
like punish because this is his opinion
though no but it's not a simple like
just like oh yeah [ __ ] you like you know
like
it's not like that it's like really uh
angering both parties and and making it
like worse
you know um and not giving a good image
you know how [ __ ]
uh he's so stupid you know how how much
philippines helped in the korean economy
even in current times they're watching
the k-pop k-drama
these these days you know kirk filipinos
are all over it right
but because of this stupid guy um you
know
um the the image might be changing a
little bit and stuff
and what they've been working for has
been like you know
like tainted and tarnished and that's
not good and i think the current
government should step up and do
something about this
and also for uh you know what like like
like the
the the koreans who love philippines who
love the culture and who love it it's
just so sad
it's so angering and sad
and just like embarrassing is what i can
say
okay um he made a couple more videos but
we'll translate them just to see because
i i i don't think this is a lightly like
just ignore
kind of like whatever you gotta
understand what he's saying and
and and address logically and
uh [ __ ] him up logically uh
on like what his points i think we're
doing it wrong bro
what we should not react to this guy
because you just ignore him
because the more he gets attention the
more people will like watch him in so
so basically but he's already got all
the attention but i just want to know
uh like you know because because i want
the filipinos to know
right if you watch just the first video
ah she bar like you could just be like
what the [ __ ] kill him or something like
that right
i hate korea like that right but if you
know why he's wrong
right that's why i asked you why is he
wrong what is his views
then you understand ah he's [ __ ]
psycho or he just has a wrong view of
this communism and he has a wrong
no he's not communist you're you have a
wrong you don't know what communist is
he's very right party he wants total
rule
that's i mean communism communist is
like marxist right where like
everybody's equal
everybody's like has like whatever right
north korea he wants competition he
wants to kill people he wants to just
rule north korea is communist right he's
against communists he's totally like
total totalitarian what do you what do
you call total
totalitarian authority or authoritarian
he wants like the total rule
that's authoritarian like yeah total
opposite from communism
that's why people have to understand
like like like what you you don't
understand what he's coming from he's
always just stupid like
yeah yeah you have to understand exactly
like what the [ __ ] he's saying
exactly what the tiger stupid [ __ ] and
he's bringing up like ancestors and
stuff and saying like he's a patriot but
he's not the real true patriot
because the true patriots don't like you
know [ __ ] up the
the national you know image and the
country's um
you know good uh relationship that has a
win-win kind of um
partnership with the philippines that
has a strong bond right philippine korea
they're like brothers right and he's
trying to [ __ ] it up because he thinks
that korea is higher and you should like
rule the philippines
it's really wrong really wrong so so
that's why i'm trying to translate
them because uh it's just not it's just
not okay this is not okay and and the
sources and whatever
people can say whatever but you have to
understand exactly what he's saying okay
and understand why he did this so now
you don't just get mad right some
filipinos can get mad and just burn
korean flag right because he burned
filipinos
i'm gonna burn for him i'm not gonna
[ __ ] the koreans he didn't watch the
other stuff why he did this
you know what i'm saying he's like you
ignore it but then some filipinos might
be pissed and burning korean flags can
kill koreas and [ __ ] they're gonna
take responsible for that i'm just
trying to block that kind of hatred
saying ha understand what he's saying
but he's coming from wrong place
so we need to educate him or find ways
to [ __ ] sue him or ban the video or
something
right the best way is to ban the videos
or bring the channel down yeah bring the
channel down
so so he can you know so then there's no
more uh but he could make a new channel
yeah he can make new channel but i don't
know if you can but
yeah youtube should join their three gym
should know what he's saying
and what he says in his other videos is
very very uh
very very exaggerated extreme and
uncalled for you know and and i don't
know if it's just okay to be like
whatever but i don't think it's okay
because there's some individuals that
will take this to the extreme
and really uh do some stupid stuff that
shouldn't be done you know what i mean
but you should not do that though i know
but they're gonna you know that's why
we're trying to
analyze in china she's not surprised so
guys comment down below you should not
spread i should not
hit i would say you should not counter
hate with hate
like what you said before you have to
always counter hate with love yeah so
don't burn korean flag and like
comment down below what you guys think
and then we're gonna do a couple of more
of his videos about the apology when he
just speaks korean and then uh
you know just just to put it out there
and see okay um
all right no wait only love guys yes
go go go peace
[Music]
[Music]
cause i'm always
