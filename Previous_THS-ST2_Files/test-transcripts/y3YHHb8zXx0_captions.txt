come on
and welcome back to mg and the echo alva
siobella
and a few days ago you guys sent me this
video to react to i thought it was a
little bit
strange that you sent me this uh request
because it's not really aligned with my
channel
uh it's called uncle roger disgusted
by this egg fried rice vivid video
bbc food i'm like why did you guys send
me this i mean it's not even
i'm pretty sure it's not even like a
filipino video but then
i got to thinking because i am proud to
say that i do have filipino friends now
and they've been telling me that rice is
extremely
important in the philippines and they
can eat it at breakfast they can eat it
at lunch and they can eat it
at dinner time that's how important
rice is plus i recently
purchased my first rice cooker
okay it's a small one not that expensive
because i don't need something
uh you know super high tech but i still
purchased one
and i thought well okay i purchased a
rice cooker
i have friends that are telling me that
rice is huge in the philippines and
since this channel
is mainly focused on filipino content
i was like okay let's react to it plus
it'd be good to know how to cook
to cook rice properly especially if he's
gonna tell us
mr mr uncle roger who i've never
heard of um so if you have any

halfway
pretty impressive who knows how to do
that crack an egg with one hand
once it's on a simmer you want to cook
it for around 10 minutes you know what i
don't like
uncle roger don't like induction stove
you know those stoves with no
fire uncle raj i need that well yes if
you want to cook properly it's always
better to cook with fire not with
electricity you know
but you know we don't all have that
luxury plus
this is less dangerous you know fire is
more dangerous
fire who use induction stove it's so
lame so not satisfying you go
relax bro relax set up campfire you
don't set up camp induction though oh

will make it what the hell
[Music]

put my leg down from chest why are you
running water surround
i i agree that that i would never do
like the rice is already cooked why are
you running
water over it and you you're supposed to
do that before you cook the rice right
you're ruining the rice first you use
colander to dry the rice and then you
put water then why bother drying the
rice
who cooked rice like this how did this
woman get on ppc food
[Laughter]

seasoning okay this one okay and then
you want to put all the other
ingredients in
rice oh the set
gloopy right the random poland

and then you just want to stir it all
together and cook it through
for about three to five minutes this
looks okay
but look too healthy wear your msg you
don't use msg how to make good egg fire
rice
it's just white people egg fire rice msg
is the the king of flames yo
i agree 100 like he said her rice looks
too healthy i mean healthy is good but
you need
a little bit of flavor you know eva if
you said in life use msg
if you're happy in life use msg put msg
in everything it'll turn it better
what is it baby put msu on baby
smarter and that's done time to plate up
the colors are still oh no oh no

you're using metal to scrape your sauce
pan higher this is nonstick
i love it higher higher saucepan cannot
use metal
your parents never teach you if i use
metal on saucepan at home growing up i
would be this old no more parents
why are you often i use metal on
saucepan
very few things break asian people hot
one is when your rice run out number two
is when you scrape pan with
metal spoon first my wife leave me now

accent is just hilarious so delicious
i'm very proud of myself why are you
part of yourself
you you messed up everything you spray
saucepan with metal
dry the rice and wet the rice and dry
the rice with colander
you don't use msg why this woman proud
of herself

her rice does not look horrible it does
look tasty

loved it um i didn't think she messed it
up
as much as he thought she did you know

here and there
um and of course of course it's always
better
to cook with a stove with the you know
real
fire i mean when you go to a fast food
place here we got like thai express
and stuff you always see them with the
big walk you know this big
you know and the forearm of the cook is
like this
huge because he does this all day long
