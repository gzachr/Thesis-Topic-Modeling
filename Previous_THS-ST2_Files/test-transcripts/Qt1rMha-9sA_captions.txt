reaction
this is
all the reactors out there if you uh
really support you guys need to come
here yeah yeah come to the philippines
okay we're checking
okay
um
i was just looking for like an outlet
outside of music so i was doing music
before reactions and then i came across
a channel called the real rejects and
they react to movie traders tv trailers
and i watched the videos for a good two
to three years before actually starting
my youtube channel and then one day i
thought like i can do this too and i
just started you know reacting to
traders and it changed to music and then
i found filipino artists and then i just
fell in love with filipino music and
thank you
and now i'm getting on the whispers
and are you ready to sing your first
song just kidding wow
yeah i think it's about nearly two years
now since the last
on my first reaction tomorrow said i'm
on and after the first song i was hooked
and i just kept watching and watching
message for you
molly i absolutely love you how did you
guys feel after that after the interview
i don't know i think um i think i i
think i crashed and burned but i think i
feel like she saved it i don't think so
i feel like the complete opposite just
happened even just answering those
questions then i felt like i could have
said a lot better answers i'm just
saying the first thing that comes to
mind
i know my audience gonna be annoyed that
i didn't perform so that's why i'm
making the promise now
yeah give me a year to prepare
yeah that was good were you were you
ready though like were you i felt like
you felt backed into a corner and you
were just ready to drop drop ball i had
a feeling someone was going to ask me
i'm damn palms are sweaty knees weak
heavy hey
oh wait we should
don't even go after that i wanted to go
before you just in case just like i
didn't want to go after you so how do
you feel i feel relieved i do too i feel
like there's a lot of pressure because i
was also stressing over this too
now we can i actually we're still going
to meet myself you guys have any more to
it i'm just saying we're i we're glad
you were you went there with us to
battle well i'm glad you guys are here
with me and you made it so much easier
okay we're back at the venue and we can
go whenever we want now do you want to
eat nas
do you want to eat
yeah
nah i don't know do you want to hear it
thank you thank you appreciate it hey
what's up man subscriber my man
thank you nice to meet you this came
with the wish bus and
i'm kind of glad that portions out the
way now i can just enjoy the rest of the
concert
but we've still got another hour and a
half until the show actually starts to
deal with this we're going to be meeting
morrissette backstage after the concert
so it's going to be somewhat tired and
i'm guessing happy and over the moon
because you know after performing at
your own grand concert you'll be able to
know i hope she likes this gift of which
i think i forgot to record so i'll
probably put pictures somewhere then you
guys know what i
gave posted and what i wrote in the card
actually no i think i should leave that
as private because that is only for her
to read
if she decides
it's somewhat cringe as well but i mean
everywhere
hey boys a little different in this vlog
right now
from three beers and counting hey
i think people want to take photos i
feel like i'm in everyone's way yeah i'm
about to make a wish right now
um another inside my head
making our way into the concert so i'm
just gonna vlog my way in
people there

i'm so excited right now it may not look
like i'm excited but i'm just trying to
contain like salmon right now i'd say
over there

this is what we call filipino
and it doesn't help when uh the previous
starters were singing songs
the thing is after hearing her sing i
don't think i'm ready to hear more sense
though
