[Music]
and
today we will be learning about the
babying
script you might be wondering why i
chose to
react to the video titled babain
video documentary about the essence and
importance of the bavarian scare
script well it's because
uh i started watching the filipino anime
called
trese and you can notice some
babain script in on the cover
of this anime okay like you can see the
uh main character called alexandra
tresse you know and behind her
you can see like some type of writing
right
and i think that's the babain script and
they also
used it in the first episode
to basically kill a ghost okay they
wrote
the script on the floor
so you know after i reviewed the first
episode
someone sent me this video and i thought
it would be
nice to react to it and learn more about
the babain script
maybe it will help me understand the
show
even more alright but before we start
please consider follow me on instagram
music game news and without further ado
let's get to it
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
this documentary is very well made man
and it's translated
[Music]
love the animations damn see like
filipinos
were not you know fair skinned
by
bye bye bye bye bye in
it's bye bye
he's got babayin script on his shirt
let me know in the comment section
so
[Music]
foreign
i think the writing is beautiful
[Music]
uh
that's true i've read that somewhere uh
in the in the video that i reacted to
mentioned that it was the spanish
and also i think the americans that
brought education to the philippines
well apparently it's not true
foreign
[Music]
uh
uh maybe he also sells furniture
with uh by buying uh you know
script uh written on it
[Music]
is
[Music]
well i don't know if they decided to
destroy it's more like you know they
conquered the philippines right that's
what conquerors do
they come they bring their culture they
bring their traditions
their language and just to try to
establish it
in the country that or the territory
that they're trying to
[Music]
is
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
calligraphy
[Music]
he's right like why write other
countries
calligraphy and writings when you can
write your own right like by being
[Music]
by showing them you know tv shows and
animes where they use this uh script
right where they use by buying just like
interesse yeah
because you know uh the the students and
millennials
and the younger generation are
interested in video games
and in tv tick tock and social media so
you have to find a way to
include that in those medias right in
video games and
tv shows that would help a lot
[Music]
on social media technology
programs
but this is definitely a difficult task
because i mean
even tagalog you know is not
disappearing per se
but most filipinos can't speak
only tagalog you know they mix tagalog
with
english so if you can't
speak tagalog fully like speak tagalog
without mixing it with any other
language
how can you expect people to learn
another language you know like
it's a difficult task
an ancient language
[Music]
see what i mean even he is mixing uh
tagalog with english he said open-minded
see
it's it's not easy and i'm not uh you
know criticizing or anything because
even in algeria we mix
arabic with the french and now with
english you know
that's just the way the world is going
that's the direction we're taking
and it's fine it's fine but yeah i mean
it would be sad to lose our
you know old ancient languages but
i don't know i don't know what the
solution is
[Music]
it's a beautiful writing it looks like
drawings
[Music]
support llama
bye bye in is on its way to becoming the
official national writing system thanks
to a bill approved by the committee
on basic education and culture yo that's
dope
bye bye bye bye
house bill 1022 or the proposed national
writing system act is authorized by rep
leopold
bata oil the measure seeks to declare by
bain as the philippine national writing
system generating greater awareness on
the plight of bye bye
and foster wider appreciation on its
importance and beauty
bye
i mean i'm pretty sure that uh
throughout
time you know many languages
must have disappeared you know and i
think it is what it is
like you know earth the people
evolve right and some languages
some cultures some traditions have to
disappear for
newer languages and newer traditions to
uh
you know to be born and maybe they're
better who knows
so i don't think we can control this
i think human beings will gravitate
towards what they like
you know and nowadays i guess it's
english the english language that's
ruling
everything the english language is
ruling social media
so yeah i don't know i can't
bring much more than this to the table
if you guys have more information
about the baibain script slash
is it is it a language i don't know but
they say it's a script it's a writing if
you have more information about this let
me know
and uh is this is the bob baibain script
the writing that is used by the
underworld and mythical filipino
mythical creatures
