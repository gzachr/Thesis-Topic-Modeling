Mr John Lery Villanueva shares his top three favourite Filipino dishes. Adobo, Lumpia, Tortang Talong, Kare Kare, Lechon are also on the menu. The Sago Gulaman tastes like how my grandma makes grass jelly. It's very refreshing, but you know what? After this meal, it just makes me want to eat dessert. The traditional way of eating this actually, don't need the straw. Lery tries all the dishes at Lechon Republic in Singapore. He gives it a 5.5 out of 5 for the taste, but a minus five for the saltiness of the eggplant. Sisig is a dish that was invented in Lery's hometown. The dish is called Sisig but for this one it's a little bit different because they use Lechon as the meat. A portion of half a kilo and it's 25 dollars which is like, can fit like 4 people (portion), say real. Lery: Chicharon Bulaklak is made of like deep fried ruffled fat. After I eat this, I really cannot function guys, my brain is. Lery: If you have five people, you can order three dishes, enough. Pork Logganissa, crab fat risotto and pickled cucumbers are among the dishes on offer at Kubo. The restaurant is based in the heart of Manila, the Philippines. Lery has tried two dishes from the Philippines. The octopus tentacles are smoked octopus testicles. The beef stew inside the donut is called Beef Pares. Turon is made of unripe bananas. Lery: Every single dish injects an element of like, Filipino cuisine. The fried spring rolls, it actually lived up to its name, as a Turon. And you know like you're peak Asian when you say a dessert is not too sweet. The Beef Kare Kare from Nanay's Kitchen really blew my mind and it's something that I can see myself eating regularly. The Turon at Kubo is not like the very like normal way that you have it in the Philippines, just like a whole new experience.
