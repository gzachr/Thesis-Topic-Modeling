For the past week we have been exploring the amazing island of Siargao Philippines room we have loved exploring the island on two wheels and of course playing in the sand. We got off the beaten path to experience something new in a fallen in love the local food we even learned to snorkel and were introduced to the world under the water. Alexa and Chloe were out of cash and decided to drive to Joppa to get some money for tomorrow's island trip. ATM is still offline but that's okay we can make it another day with date books. We have about 12 dollars left to our name so that should last us lunch and dinner hopefully and then hope for bagels we're working again. Alexa and Chloe were greeted by these kids that just kept waving at us and they were just absolutely adorable so Alexa and Chloe went over and and met them and she made some new friends so it was pretty awesome people are always so friendly here as we drive by kids always yell and say hey how are you.
