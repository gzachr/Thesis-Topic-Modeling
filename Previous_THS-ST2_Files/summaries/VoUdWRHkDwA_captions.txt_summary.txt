 Tag Along With Chai travels to Bohol in the Philippines. Chai and a friend take a ferry from Cebu island to the other side of the island. They ride two motorbikes around the Chocolate hills. The Philippines has been amazing to us. Pretty much everyone speaking English. The food that we have been tasting is phenomenal. There are a few foreign tourists. But mainly there are local tourists. CNN is traveling through Southeast Asia and now we are in the Philippines for several weeks. If you want to join this journey. think of the Philippines. I would like to say from the Philippines at Panglao island connected to Bohol Island.
