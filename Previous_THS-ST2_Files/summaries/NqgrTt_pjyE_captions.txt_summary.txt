Layan Salem plays a game of Jojowahin or Totropahin with his friends. The game is based on the Filipino slang for a boyfriend or a friend. Derek Ramsay, Layan would date you - Jojowain you. Diether Ocampo gives me the vibes of... Full House. James Reid has such a baby face. I would totropahin. So Echo is his nickname he began his career by winning the Mr. Pogi talent search on a noontime variety show - I need to show you this one - okay that was him before what is he wearing? what is this? I don't know it's 1996 I think but he has evolved into a hot man yeah. yeah - he gives that humble vibe. Gerald Anderson is not my type, says Layan. Yobi Gevero congratulates Layan on his engagement to Piolo Pascual. Layan says if any of the celebrities watched this my email is in my instagram.
