Can you apply for fiance visa while still
married?
Now okay we have Chris.
Thank you so much for accepting me to your
group.
I hope to learn about
the process that best suits my case with getting
my fiance to Australia from the Philippines.
I'm in
the process of filing my divorce next step
is submitting an application to the family
court which can
be a lengthy process.
I'm unsure on what visa I should be trying
to apply for my Filipina partner and I
are wishing, hoping to obtain a visa for the
end of March for her to come to Australia.
I would be
sincerely grateful for some direction.
Yeah, no problems.
Okay, your situation is, okay now I'm assuming
you're probably talking about
marrying in Australia here.
All right, look you basically for practical
purposes you need to be legally
free-to-marry before we can apply for a fiance
visa.
Reason for that, it is written in the regulations
there are what's known as time-of-application
requirement and the time-of-decision requirement.
So for a fiance visa, that's also known
as a prospective marriage visa ... At the
time of application
you can be still not divorced but at the time
of decision you must be legally free-to-marry.
Now we make a point that we never apply for
a fiance visa if the applicant or sponsor
are not
legally free-to-marry that particular point.
Because whilst it is an average processing
time of nine
months, we've had them take about six weeks!
So if they turn around and say we are ready
to make
a decision six weeks after the application
is lodged and you're not legally free-to-marry
at that point
they can refuse the application.
We can start preparing the application any
time.
There is normally
two to three months sometimes even more depending
on how good you are at organizing what we
require from you and for a fiance visa
application.
So it's always a good idea to start early.
In other
words, we can start preparing no problems.
You get your divorce organized in the meantime
and
then hopefully by the time that divorce comes
through, we are ready to apply.
Okay, thank you for
that.
