Hello mommy!
Oh that's you.
Oliver ha!
Just because that's fat.
But here,
what we're today cooking is delicious!
My children are you hungry?
Really really hungry!
I'm not asking you, I'm asking my other children.
What are we cooking today mommy?
Oh because it's really raining in the Philippines right now.
I know there's a storm.
This is what's delicious, sour, soupy,
Your armpits?!
I cleaned it.
Pork Sinigang (Pork Sour Soup)
My favorite.
The pork belly.
The fats of the pig.
Soup bone.
The bones of the pork.
Of course it's really delicious when you're gnawing on it.
And spareribs.
I'm sure you'll be sweating after you eat this.
The back of your neck will be exploding (high blood).
Shout out Dr. Antique of Makati.
We're now going to wash our pork, my pets.
The part of the pork that we got is really nice.
Look at the pork belly, it's not too fatty, just right.
And it has some bones and cartilage.
And you're going to dip it in fish sauce later.
I'll massage it first for a bit.
We're going to wash it three times.
We're not going to put water.
There it is, it's covered.
Let's start cooking it.
Let's wash our hands first with soap.
OK we're going to cook it now.
There.
High heat of course.
Our stove will be high.
Because we are now going to start to boil and tenderize the meat.
We're not going to put anything else, just the meat.
High.
We're going to boil for 30 minutes before we put the onions and tomatoes.
Bow.
And now we are going to cover it.
There.
Alright.
Here is our vegetable ingredients.
Radish.
Taro.
Water spinach.
Eggplant.
Okra.
Long beans.
It's not good unless there's chili for dipping.
Serrano chili.
Oh is this serrano?
There's so many chilies out there I don't even know anymore. As long as it's chilli.
 We're going to put onions.
Two big tomatoes.
To make it sour, knorr tamarind soup mix.
Salt.
Fish sauce. Peace? (pronunciation)
For me peace, peace sauce.
No Mom (pronunciation), fish!
 I don't care, patis (Filipino translation)!
Why are you using two salty flavoring?
Because I only put a little bit.
Because salt is to add saltiness.
The fish sauce is to add a layer of flavor.
To give it that umami taste.
I don't wanna wear an apron so that you will see this (her apron earring).
Thank you Nicole for giving this to us, my bestie!
Thank you Nicole we love you.
OK, princess Nicole.
Tip!
We can use so many things for sinigang! Right?
 Fish.
Chicken.
Beef.
All of those you can substitute as meat.
The soup is still the same it's not going to change.
Please comment down below what kind of sinigang you like!
Beef sinigang, pork, fish.
And what kind of ingredients version you put.
Tamarind? Tree cucumber? Cotton fruit? Guava? Miso?
And so much more.
I'm excited, because I'm almost ready to eat.
It's boiling.
Look how good that looks.
Yes, it's been 30 minutes.
We're going to remove the dirt on the sides.
Of course we're not going to put our onions and tomatoes.
I put a lot of tomatoes because it's really good.
  It gives an extra sourness and sweetness.
Our onions.
And we're going to put our taro.
Taro.
Because it takes longer to cook.
Our work is almost tender.
There it is.
I put a lot of taro because it's Oliver's favorite.
And now we're going to close the lid again.
Another 30 minutes again.
While we're waiting for our sinigang to cook again.
Look what Pizza Hut gave to us, they made it for us.
Both our names.
It's engraved Olly and Mama LuLu.
Our logo, and Pizza Hut's logo, it's like a pizza paddle.
We're not going to use it, we're just going to put it as a display.
Yes.
We're really flattered.
And we're really really happy.
Wow there's somebody cooking something else!
 What are you cooking Ate Apple?
Buko Pandan (gelatin with coconut and sweet cream).
What are the layers, what did you put?
I put about five ingredients, actually six ingredients only.
Canned coconut.
Nestl√© cream, table cream.
Condensed milk.
The pandan flavored jelly. (vanilla grass)
And nata de coco that is green too.
What's that? The grass jelly whole.
Stuff like that happens all the time OK?
You don't really need a separate vlog for this because it's very easy to do.
That's why we did it as a side dish.
 After you mix it very well,
you're going to put it in the fridge.
1 to 2 hours for it to chill.
And then it's ready to serve.
OK, it's been 30 minutes.
Let's open it.
You know what I'm going to do first?
I'm going to crush the tomatoes.
So the flavor will be infused with the soup.
I really take my time with this.
So that the soup will be a reddish.
We're going to put our knorr.
How many packets are you using?
Two because there's a lot of soup.
Let's put it in.
We're only putting a little bit of salt, about 1 teaspoon.
Because I don't want it to be too salty.
Because our knorr, it already has a lot of flavoring.
We're not going to put our radish.
I also put a lot of radish.
Our eggplant.
We're going to put it too.
Long beans first actually, so it's more organized.
Because it takes a while to cook.
We're going to close the lid again.
About 10 minutes.
And also, how about the vegetables,
don't mix it in just leave it on top and close the lid.
The steam is what's going to cook the vegetables.
So it's still a bit crunchy.
And not overcooked.
It's been 10 minutes!
We're not going to put the okra,
Chilli.
And our water spinach.
Let's put it in.
Of course the chilli.
There is the water spinach.
There, putting the water spinach on the side.
We're just going to submerge so it'll fit.
Mix it
just a bit.
There look at that.
Let's close it for a minute.
So it'll cook for a bit.
Just half cook.
You think it's too full.
But it's bursting with flavor.
While we wait for it to cook, of course we have to taste it.
So I can give my cooking a verdict.
It's just right?
Yes.
But wait, I'm going to put a little bit of fish sauce.
Just a little bit.
One, two, three.
Our sinigang is cooked!
I'm going to turn it off!
See you at the table!
It's cooked!
Let's look at the meat.
There.
It's absolutely tender.
It's sliding off the bone.
There look at it it's calling me.
Taro.
Of course I will get the one that is calling my name.
One more.
There.
I'll put okra.
Look at it carefully.
Right? It's waving at you. But look at my dipping sauce of course.
Fish sauce.
With chilli!
I could also get the chili from the sinigang.
But usually it's to give it a bit of spiciness.
Just right, for the cold weather.
And rainy weather.
Here let's taste it.
Let me get the chili first.
Of course.
There.
And of course,
the one waving at me I need to taste it.
Put a bit of the vegetable.
Of course, I'll take care of it.
Crunchy.
It's waving at me.
Back of your neck.
Is there?
So good, just the right sourness.
Taro.
Radish.
Everything is delicious!
There, we are successful again in our cooking.
Easy to cook but very delicious and flavorful.
Don't forget!
