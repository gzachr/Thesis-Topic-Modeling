Today, we're here to eat food that Filipinos love
It's Barbecue
Barbecue is a dish where you grill meat and vegetables
You can eat it anywhere in the PH
It's one of the representative dishes of the PH
I asked my favorite Cebuano restaurant if I could film a video, 
Thankfully they invited me
This is Yakski in Cebu
Yakski, a barbecue restaurant in Cebu, is run by a family
Thankfully, one of their family members  
Ms. Anne Roxas has given us her time
I'm Seon
I'm Anne
Nice to meet you
When I came here first time,
Yakski is the only delicious food
Anne: Oh really?
That was our first meal, right?
- Yeah 2020, first day, first night
- Yeah 2020, first day, first night
-  First day, first night, right?
I was so surprised
Barbecue with the sauce
And it tastes like
- Similar to Korea like -
- Similar to Korea like...
- Korean?
- Based on soy sauce or like garlic, right? Maybe
- Based on soy sauce or like garlic, right? Maybe
- Uh huh, Yeah
So, I was like...
Woaaahh...what is it?
Yakski barbecue started in 2009 with
their father, Flaviano "Boyaks" Roxas
He invited his friends to taste his barbecue 
using his special sauce
That's how he started his own restaurant
The name of the restaurant Yakski came from 
his nickname, Boyaks
They started out on such a small scale 
Until, it became a famous restaurant
Now it is a famous restaurant
 with three branches in Cebu
What made Yakski a famous restaurant like it is now?
Ms. Roxas said two reasons for this
It's their secret sauce and cleanliness
So the special blend of barbecue sauce also evolved
So, My mom Rosita
Added a little spike to it
So originally,
It's just original sauce that's all
It's just there's... there's one
So my mom
You know put a twist to it
And then added spicy, Spicy options
So that's why you know the famous question is
Is it original or spicy?
When everybody is out
That's when they do sauce
They're only mixing it
They're only mixing it to put it in 5-gallon containers
So that's how we also transport the sauces
Even now, only their family knows the recipe for the sauce
The recipe that they can tell us is
They're using the their mother's magic spell
I think we're proud of
It's clean
We would eat it, 
I mean I would eat it personally, you know
Cleanliness is of paramount importance to them. 
They even have a place for clean sauce and meat
When I look at the restaurant, 
I can see a clean kitchen
Even when there was a blackout during the typhoon, 
they discarded a lot of ingredients for cleanliness
I think this is the key to Yakski's success
Shall we go and taste it?
I'm at the Yakski Capitol branch
Finally I'm going to enjoy Yakski Barbecue
If you go to Yakski, 
You can check the meat like this
The menu is like this
I ordered a variety of dishes to show you
as many dishes as possible
Chicken legs, breast, and chicken skin
Pork and pork belly
I ordered a hotdog and chorizo
Unfortunately, they didn't have 
chicken liver ,gizzard and heart that day
If you order a barbecue,
They'll grill it in the kitchen right away
Just like this
And you can order rice together
Eating it with rice like this
It's one of the ways to eat it deliciously
And Yakski's signature sauce
Two different sauces are served 
at different levels of spiciness
And you have to order Mountain Dew
that goes really well with Filipino barbecue
Let's start eating now
I had chicken skin barbecue first
It's a taste that makes you smile
The spicy sauce catches the oiliness of 
the chicken skin
Then you can feel the perfect balance if you eat rice
Next, chicken legs and chicken breast
If you want to eat something full,
You should order chicken legs and chicken breast
It will make you full
Next is pork and pork belly
Pork is always right for Koreans
The proportion of fat and lean meat is great
If you want to enjoy it at a reasonable price, order several pork
If you want to eat something full,
 you can order pork belly
Lastly, hotdog and chorizo
Both ingredients are basically seasoned meat
I thought it would be strong (salty taste), but it's not
If you eat it with rice, 
it's enough to feel balanced (perfect blend)
Personally, I don't really like sausages
But still, I enjoyed it
But for Koreans, we are not so familiar with chorizo,
So I think there will be some people 
who'll like it or dislike it
Yes, I tried Yakski Barbecue
I think it's a restaurant that you can enjoy
There are various food to choose from, 
so it's great to eat it with your friends
The sauce helps to get rid of the oiliness 
of the ingredients
Rice and Mountain Dew go really well with barbecue
And I could feel the cleanliness of the store  
So I was able to eat there comfortably
This place where you can enjoy
delicious Filipino barbecue is
Yakski
Thank you for watching the video today
If you come to Cebu, make sure to try Yakski
I'm Seon By the way
Thank you!
