I was treated to a barbecue for dinner.
"Do you want this? It's the wings of the chicken."
"Oh, good."
I ordered pork skewers and chicken skewers.
I was sorry that I ordered a lot because of Lucas.
"Do you order all this?"
"Isn't that too much?"
"It's too much."
"Isn't that a lot?"
"Is it okay if I ask you to do this?"
"Yes, it's all right."
"I'm going to have a little."
"Just a little?"
Upon receipt of the order, empty the fire with a portable fan.

I take food after waiting for about 10 minutes.
"Thank you."
I'm excited about the barbecue.

An awkward meal time passes.
Even if there's a lot to say,
We can't help it because we can't communicate.
Elizabeth, who talks with courage.
"Why don't you eat chicken wings?"
'Give me the kids.' / 'No."
"Why not?"
"They can't eat chicken."
"I can't eat kids because it's a wing."
"I can't eat wings."
"Then you can have JR."
"Eat full, eat full."
"I'm ashamed."
"I'm shy."
"Don't be shy."
"We met in Lapurafushi."
"Lafurapu City?"
"And you moved here?"
"Yes."
"I used to work as a housekeeper."
"Housekeeper? I see."
"Why aren't you working now?"
"No."
"Are you just staying at home?"
"Yes, when they were kids, it was okay to go out and work.
I need to be there because the kids have to go to school now."
"Oh, I got it."

And the morning scenery was more ecstatic than yesterday.

"Hi."
"Say hello."
"Good-bye."
It's a pity that I'm leaving.
The road to go is also a series of ministers.
