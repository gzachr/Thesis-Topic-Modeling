rolling in the deep and this came uh requested

um okay i'm gonna pause that for a second 
because it looked like a good place to pause it i  
i kind of hope that the whole set that she's 
not using the auto tune on the voice like that  
or whatever they you whatever the hell you call 
it i hope they're not using that on the whole  
song but you know what even if they do it'll be 
the first time that i actually like it because  
the person behind it kz tan dingin is is amazing i 
mean i i i i've been turned on to marcelito pamoy

okay it's important to have good music as well  
because then you have the the great like you 
know you've got if you can't cook with hot  
with cold oil you have to have auto 
hot oil and she's cooking with hot oil  
i also want to say something else this is 
a song that was i recall at least i believe  
was made famous by adele right now adele in 
her own right is one of the finest singers  
on the planet ever so in order to cover a song 
like that and then put your own twist on it  
and then completely turn it upside down 
inside out and make it your own and then
and then make it that good that's 
what we call effortless mastery
plus i have to say my wife is somewhere 
she's kind of cute and that's really cute  
she's really cute and that that 
makes it uh unusually scary wake up
oh
okay okay i have to give it a stack score 
okay i'm going to give it a stack score  
i have not given a 10 yet i have 
not given a 10 stack score yet  
but i have to tell you on 
this song i have to give her
a 10. she gets a 10 she gets a 10. and that adds 
up to 30 and but it's really a 10 okay i just had  
to say it several times because it's just not so 
usually for me to give a stank score of a 10 i  
was thinking that you know there would have to 
be some dissonant harmonies in there some jazz  
stuff and or or some modern you know contemporary 
um you know classical like real trickery with the  
composition and there wasn't a whole lot of 
that it was just really good quality music  
and the way she just gave it all as if it was 
her last moment on earth i mean jesus christ  
uh loving spaghetti it's nice to be 
important but it's more important to be nice  
subscribe to my channel and listen take it 
easy and if it's really easy take it twice
