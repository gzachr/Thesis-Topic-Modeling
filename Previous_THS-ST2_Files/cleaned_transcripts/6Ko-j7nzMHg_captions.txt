what's up guys we are caro and chris and in this 
video we're gonna do a super complete travel guide  
of el nido we spent six months there during the 
beginning of the pandemic and because of that we  
have a lot of information about the accommodations 
the food the transport the attractions  
and the prices of traveling around el nido which 
became one of our favorite places in the world  
the philippines has reopened to tourism in 2022 
the country has safety measures in place and  
now fully vaccinated travelers with a booster 
shock can enter the philippines with no covet  
test or quarantine required so you just need your 
vaccination certificate your passport obviously  
and you'll need to register on a filipino portal 
called one health and there you'll be able to get  
a qr code which will allow you to travel around 
the philippines all the updated requirements can  
be found on these websites here as we mentioned 
many times here on this channel the philippines is  
our favorite beach destination and we are already 
planning our next trip there which will happen  
soon as you may know the philippines has over 
7 000 islands so there's still much more for us  
to explore but as we mentioned this video is about 
el nido so let's get into the el nido travel guide
to get there you have two options if you're 
coming from a major city like manina or cebu  
you can fly to puerto princesa and take a van 
from there which is usually the cheapest option  
but it takes a lot longer or you can fly directly 
into el nido to leo airport many people visit  
another island called coron nearby and ferries 
are also available from there to el nido  
we divided this travel guide into two parts the 
west coast of el nido and the east coast we'll  
start by talking about the more popular west coast 
where the main attractions and the el nido town  
are located the main area of el nido is el nido 
town but there are many other neighborhoods nearby  
like koronkarong and kalan in these places 
you will find many hotels and restaurants  
and this is also the area where the majority 
of the island hopping tours leave from  
some of the average accommodations that we stayed 
in were francisco inn for 36 dollars and focus  
rooms for 50 dollars we stayed at some higher 
end resorts in the area called rc villas which  
costs around seventy dollars and now needle reef 
strength resort that costs around ninety dollars  
both of these places have amazing views from the 
rooms and include a restaurant area with infinity  
pools we also rented a beachfront house in coron 
coron for a week called the beach house for 70  
dollars which is better if you want to be able to 
cook for yourself and this place was great because  
it was right on the beach and you could hear the 
waves crashing at night another unique place that  
we stayed was on a sailboat called kalayaan which 
is situated in either karankarong or el nido town  
for 130 you have a private bed and there is a 
captain on the boat who will assist you there are  
kayaks available and a smaller speed boat that can 
take you to different beaches and islands nearby
the main attraction in el nido is the island 
hopping tours there are four main boat tours  
called tour a b c and d but there are other 
private tours available for a higher price  
which allows you to mix the tours and visit some 
different areas the boat tours range from twenty  
dollars to twenty five dollars per person in a 
group tour depending on which tour you decide to  
do and you also have to pay an environmental fee 
which is around 3.60 and it is valid for 10 days  
these tours are where you encounter the 
iconic scenery that el nido is famous for  
the tours will take you to many different 
islands with incredible white sand beaches  
coral reefs and gigantic limestone cliffs some 
of our favorite spots that we visited on the  
tours are the blue lagoons pinakbuyatan 
island secret lagoon and secret beach
there are also a few places close to the mainland 
that you can visit by renting a kayak from  
the el nido town or korong korong new town you 
can kayak to the huge kadlau island in front  
which has many beautiful beaches to visit and 
from korongkorong you can visit lapos lapus  
papaya and seven commandos beach we did also 
visit our favorite island pinakbuyutan by  
kayak but it recently became a private island
in el nido town there is a place 
called tarou cliff which gives you  
the unique experience of being able 
to walk above the limestone cliffs  
for 13 you will get a guided tour to the top of 
the cliffs where you will get amazing views of the  
town below the cliff is easy to climb as they have 
built stairs so not much fitness is required the  
mainland of el nido also features many incredible 
beaches that can be visited by road the best one  
close to the center of el nido is probably vanilla 
beach which now has a small shopping area and you  
can find a few beachfront restaurants and 
accommodations there our favorite mainland  
beach overall is one called nakpan beach which is 
about a 40 minute drive from the center of aonido  
nakpong is a four kilometer beach with creamy 
colored sand and beautiful transparent water  
there are accommodations and restaurants there 
which makes it another great place to stay if you  
want somewhere quieter out of town above nakpon 
there is another great beach called dooley beach  
which is even more quieter and secluded and 
is a popular surfing spot during the winter
the area of leo which has the airport has some 
newly developed restaurants and accommodations  
which makes it another good option as a place to 
stay and is not far from el nido town all these  
places mentioned are on the west coast of el nido 
which means you get amazing sunsets almost every  
day with many sunset spots to choose from as we 
mentioned before there are many restaurants in  
the el nido town and karankarang area some of our 
favorites are happy home which is on the main el  
nido town beach and has local and international 
food at an affordable rate with great views  
there we could get a fresh tuna steak for four 
dollars coke for 70 cents and brewed coffee for  
1.90 biryani kitchen was our go-to for tasty 
indian food from an indian chef there we could get  
a chana masala for 4.60 puri bread for 1.80 and a 
roti for 1.10. another great restaurant near the  
el nido town beach is art cafe which was a bit 
more upscale with many international food options  
and usually had some good music and a good vibe 
with sea views there we could get a margarita  
pizza for 5.90 a small pumpkin soup for 2.56 and a 
breaded fish fill it with salad for seven dollars  
in karankarong we really like to 
visit a place called bellavita  
for good italian food and relaxing beach views 
there we could get a regular cuatro fromagi pizza  
for 7.10 and a large margarita pizza for the 
same price friends hostel is another great  
option which has more of a party atmosphere and 
has a great rooftop area with a pool and a bar  
and has some fun games like ping pong to get 
around el nido the two popular options are by  
tuk tuk or renting your own scooter we chose 
to get the scooter to have more freedom and  
it is also much cheaper to get around overall the 
current cost of a scooter rental is between seven  
to nine dollars a day besides beaches and islands 
there are some nice waterfalls that can be visited  
two that we visited are called nag khalid khalid 
and bulalakau falls to get to both of them you  
have to do a bit of tracking through the jungle 
but that made the experience even better and at  
the end of the sweaty trek you get to swim 
in the refreshing cool waters of the falls
during our stay in el nido we were very fortunate 
to be the first tourists to ever go on a brand  
new helicopter tour of the islands which just 
started at the end of 2020. this was easily  
one of the best experience that we had during 
our stay there and really put into perspective  
just how many islands there are and how big 
they are an experience we will never forget
now we'll get into the second part of the guide 
which will be focused on the east coast part of  
el nido the majority of tourists only explore the 
west coast of el nido but the east coast has many  
gems which shouldn't be missed a popular area 
on the east coast is called sebalton which is a  
traditional looking filipino village on the coast 
and it has more of a lazy backpacker vibe to it  
compared to el nido town here you will find many 
backpacker style beachfront accommodations above  
sebalton there is an area called san fernando 
and there we stayed at one of the nicest hotels  
in eonito called chi palawa when we visited it was 
around 300 a night this hotel has a native luxury  
style with a swimming pool yoga classes a big 
restaurant area and a beautiful exclusive beach  
they offer other things like diving tours and kite 
surfing which is popular on this coast facing this  
coast is another set of islands called lenapakan 
islands which can also be visited by both
nasa belton you can visit an archaeological 
site called ela cave within a huge limestone  
cliff discoveries in this cave have 
shown that it was inhabited and used  
in the paleolithic and neolithic times and they 
found artifacts dating back to 14 000 years ago  
this is a great option if you want to do something 
different than visiting beaches and islands  
and will give you a better historic understanding 
of the area the best place that we stayed over  
oil needle was a private island called brother 
island just off the northwestern coast this was  
the first time that we had an entire island 
to ourselves the current rate is 330 dollars  
per day and that includes both transport to the 
island three big meals and you can use all of the  
water equipment like kayaks and snorkeling gear 
the accommodation isn't luxurious but we loved  
it and the island was probably the best place 
that we have ever stayed anywhere in the world
so that's it for the guide as you can see 
there's an incredible amount of things to do  
in el nido we stayed there for six months 
and we were able to find new things to do  
and new places to visit pretty much every 
week el nido is by far one of the best  
beach destinations that we've ever been to 
and it's crazy because everywhere it goes  
just paradise and el nido is just a small part 
of the philippines so yeah the country is just  
amazing and there are many other incredible 
places like the ones that we showed in this video
