this video is brought to you by squarespace  
we are taking a break from the busy city of 
cebu so yesterday we hopped on a local bus  
and three and a half hours later we arrived in 
the small coastal town of moalboal there are so  
many exciting things to do here but the first 
thing on our list is canyoneering if you don't  
know what that is we'll basically be maneuvering 
around the canyon we'll be climbing boulders we'll  
be swimming and we'll be jumping off cliffs so 
come and join us for this exciting adventure
we're going to do the canyoning 
awesome this is our ride for the  
morning oh we're going to fit all three of us here
is my hand okay here here 
yeah yeah so sweet let's go
good morning
how are you feeling getting really excited now not 
tired anymore another kind of transportation yeah
how long is the tour it depends 
upon us okay depends upon our pace  
how long you stand there too scared to jump  
well we might be there all day then no 
problem we have plenty of time until tomorrow
so we have seven major jumps and 
they are three to ten meters high  
so these activities include trekking 
swimming and jumping off canyons
thank you so much for listening and now proceed to  
your adventure thank you you can 
follow your guide wow thank you
yeah we never go head first like this 
this is new so so far everything feels  
super organized we have to sign two consent 
forms we had a safety briefing so i'm feeling  
pretty confident about this you know 
no no me now you look very confident
this is scary already we 
haven't gone anywhere okay
get up on your feet this is scary
so now we have to walk up these steps 
for a little bit it's not that long but  
i'm out of breath and it's getting hot so 
i'm really excited to jump in the water
that looks delicious sweet potato sweet potato 
skewers oh look good the fried noodles look  
good too but uh we better not eat anything 
yet you're about to jump i might waste it  
however there's a jollibee in the middle
we're not jumping from here though we're gonna go  
down a little a little further this is 
a bit too high we don't have a parachute
wow you can see how clear the water is from here
don't think about it and just jump it all right 
easy let's do it let's do it so mico just told  
us that the whole trail from the start to finish 
is eight kilometers long but we already did the  
zip line which was 1.5 kilometers so we still 
have around six and a half kilometers of ground  
to cover through the canyon oh i didn't think it 
would get this deep like i can't touch the ground  
okay the first jump is just over there and mico 
said we have five jumps and the last jump is  
unlimited so we'll see how we feel wow this is the 
first jump i thought you would like ease us in a  
bit and start with a smaller jump we go gradually 
from smallest to highest this is small already
you got it you gotta let go 
of his hand three two one
nice
i feel like this is quite a 
challenge for us like mentally  
now my adrenaline is pumping oh 
there's like a mini waterfall here  
i think this is absolutely perfect 
setting to be doing canyoneering  
the water is clear the limestone is 
nice this is the ultimate marriage test
we're jumping off the cliff together
this is one of the highest activities we 
wanted to do highest on our list we're ready
it was so scary together yeah so we're not 
going to do that again i love you though
mahal kita
what is it it's amazing in philippines 
mico is not just our tour guide he is also  
a very good uh photographer he's 
always got the photo spot ready for us
so now what does it mean i don't trust you 
i don't trust you i don't think it's awesome
real quick when we're not out filming and 
stuffing our faces with delicious food  
we are busy working on behind the scenes work and 
we recently launched a new website that was built  
using squarespace with hundreds of customizable 
settings like font and color we have had a lot of  
fun trying them out before finally deciding 
on the look and feel that was right for us  
it's also been super easy to add new content and 
in this case we added a new shop so please check  
out our new merch that's designed by note we are 
still tweaking and improving our website but it's  
been a breeze being able to make small changes on 
the go using the squarespace app just head over to  
squarespace.com for a free trial and when you're 
ready to launch go to squarespace.com/floraandnote  
to save 10% off your first purchase of a website 
or domain now let's get back to jumping off cliffs  
so we have a little break here as we uh swim 
through this part to go to the next jumping  
point i'll just quickly mention the cost 
for canyoneering so it cost us 1500 pesos  
for a person and we added another 500 pesos to 
do the ziplining so 2000 pesos each can you do  
this anywhere else in the philippines 
no uh it's only in cebu south of cebu
there's no other canyoneering 
that's why you see people from  
many different countries coming here 
this place is absolutely amazing
so to do this tour you don't really need 
to know how to swim but you kind of need  
to be physically fit because there's a lot of 
climbing and hiking yeah so uh come prepared
wasn't joking there is actually someone 
selling grilled chicken chicken sausage  
pork and chicken intestine delicious i'm so hungry 
even though we had breakfast but i am so hungry  
from all the climbing what do we have here how 
do you choose because they're selling the same  
thing i feel bad if i pick one over the other one 
chicken one sausage one pork one chicken intestine  
and three waters should we just sit here sit 
there are the vendors from the same family or no  
they're almost same family almost yeah they are 
living in one place so whatever whatever money  
they make is combined no different family but how 
come they don't sell different things i don't know
you want to try this chicken intestine  
my friend did tell me to try 
this he said this is really good
that's delicious i like this more than pork 
intestine pork intestine is too creamy for me  
this one is very chewy and delicious  
this one is really high no i'm not sure 
if it was a good idea that i ate so much
wow
you got this
oh my god
you can't turn back now flora is taking some time 
now because it is very very high i'm not sure if  
you can tell from the camera but in real life it's  
super high i'm probably gonna 
have trouble jumping too
i honestly didn't think i'd be this scared but 
it looks so scary because you have to jump out
okay
i'm shaking still oh my gosh i'm so proud 
of you i'm proud of you babe you did it
oh my goodness there's still 10 meters 
wait you're shaking yeah you're scared i am
i got like a little panic attack after really
i didn't think i would be scared i'm not usually 
scared i think you should hold the camera  
breathe deep breath deep breaths
you're okay you did great
seven  
meters or eight meters you have 10 meters 
ahead of us all right okay let's go
we need more than hopes and wishes for us 
to make it through the night final jump
this is the last jump of our tour here 10 meters  
i'm gonna do it in style yeah i'm 
gonna go first you got this babe
this one step forward okay it's an easy jump okay 
hold it have your arms when you go down yeah okay
three two one  
oh
did the straps go up your butt my 
strap pretty much tucked my packet up  
i think my intestine is already up my chest now  
oh wow that was so scary you didn't 
hesitate at all me mm-hmm so proud of you
we are back at our hotel now let me catch you up 
on what happened after our last jump we continued  
on and we walked towards kawasan falls which 
is the end point of our tour it is a beautiful  
waterfall and from there we had another 15-minute 
hike to go back to the highway where we'll be  
picked up and then it was only a two-minute 
drive to get back to the kawasan canyoneering  
headquarters where they prepared a huge lunch 
for us we had fried chicken we had noodles we  
had spring rolls or lumpia it was all so good and 
we devoured everything because we were so hungry  
since everything is still fresh in our minds 
we have two tips we want to share with you guys  
the first one is to bring cash because there will 
be some local vendors selling some food and drinks  
that you might want to try the second one is if 
you don't have a dry bag a gopro or some wet shoes  
don't worry because you can rent everything at 
the office we had the most amazing day we want  
to say thank you to mico from kawasan canyoneering 
for taking us on this awesome adventure so if you  
are coming to cebu make sure to add this to your 
list thanks again for watching and as always have  
a wonderful day we'll see you in the next one 
bye-bye bloopers mico why do we have to wear  
helmets again because there's sometimes lots of 
crazy monkey around the mountain they're gonna  
throw us a stone so we protect our head from the 
stone really yeah it's true can i throw rocks back
okay
is
we were so young baby
