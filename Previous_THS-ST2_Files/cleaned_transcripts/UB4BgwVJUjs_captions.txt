I'm going to play you a few songs
for three seconds, 10 seconds,

You'll be aiming to guess
just the language the song is in.
Hit the buzzer 
when you know the answer,
and if you guess it wrong,
then your opponent
would have the chance to guess.
And then afterwards,
we'll watch a little bit
of the music video for you.

the music definitely makes it
a little bit more challenging, right?
Especially the German one,
like they're going so fast.
