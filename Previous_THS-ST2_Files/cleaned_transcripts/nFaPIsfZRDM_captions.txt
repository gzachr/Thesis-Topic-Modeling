Hello everybody and welcome once again 
to Elena For Reels my guest for today  
is from Utah I met her back in the Philippines  
17 years ago and we will tell you more 
about it please welcome my dear friend Grace
hi guys thanks for inviting me thank you for 
letting me um have you on my little show we met  
17 years ago can you tell my 
viewers if you remember how we met  
uh I think either it's a seminar uh 
at the DFA and then I think so embassy  
yes yes that's how I remembered it too I think we 
spent the whole day at the embassy doing our thing  
processing our papers in preparation for our 
you know trip to the U.S yes yes that's how  
Grace and I met both our husbands petitioned us 
so Grace I'm always interested in the love story  
of my friends I interviewed can you tell me 
more about your love story you and troy right  
yeah uh we met I think we met on uh like uh 
writing a letter you know like in a pen pal  
uh letter so we that's initially it's my 
aunt that was he already here in the u.s  
she's doing all the pen pal thing and then 
um uh she already she was already married
years ago and then letters came to us to 
our address and then I reply on one of the
the guy of the yeah and then i told that uh uh 
him that you know my aunt is already married  
and um you know i'm her niece and that's 
where it started but even before i met Troy I  
met another one a pilot too and Troy's in the 
military right he is a Civilian now he he was  
a military before but he um what he called 
that medically discharged when was that  
oh years ago when did you get here i think 
uh i can't remember i think it's around maybe  
august or um yeah i think around august of 2004 
when i got here it's amazing because we just  
exchanged our yahoo messenger ids when i got 
here i think you were one of the first people  
i contacted because i know you were already here 
and then that was it and then we moved to facebook  
eventually but we never talked to each other 
again right until today yes um what's that myspace
first that's how we just update each other 
and then i think i remember you moved to Japan  
yes uh i think after maybe a year later you 
know maybe six months later we moved to Japan  
uh we um he got the job a civilian for 
uh two years the contract is two years  
but you could stay there until for five 
years but we only stayed there for two years
home and he loves his family so typically you know 
in Christmas Thanksgiving you know oh his mom and  
dad and his sisters are here yeah we only stayed 
in Japan for two years and then we moved back here  
and  this is really hard you know the flip side 
of the um the time everything that happens here  
already done we're just finding out things like 
that and he you know he doesn't really care for it  
being there like um yeah he wants uh to be 
around with the family the same time to um  
family could help you know with the kids 
because i have two young kids oh yeah so  
when you move in the u.s when you move 
to Japan you already have two kids right  
yeah i i had a six-month-old girl it was 
Sydney and then I was pregnant during that  
time and then that's where i deliver Shannon so 
Shannon is an Okinawa baby ah okay so what's her
citizenship now Filipino American Japanese uh no 
we're we are all u.s citizens basically though  
she's she was born in Japan in foreign country 
as long as it is a um military installation U.S
installation yeah the kids are uh American 
if she wants to be a a uh Japanese she can  
she later on if she wants a dual 
citizen and then that she could apply  
but i think when you were born in the 
u.s you know like a naval hospital  
yeah you're automatically a u.s citizen 
ah considered territory of the us
I remember Grace you mentioned to me or you 
shared with me before when you were in Japan  
you were able to bring your parents to Japan right 
did they stay the entire two years with you oh i  
think they only stayed maybe uh six months i think 
uh three months at you know the initial i can't  
remember what's the Japan's law i think he paid 
so much like maybe a three month only and then we  
file an extension so that's why they were able to 
extend their time there at least six months yeah  
so they stayed there for six months that 
helped me when I gave birth to my second child
so they were able to take care of 
the baby and then we have a toddler  
having you know around your parents were 
able to help you yeah because i rather 
got them to have somebody else that i don't know  
uh will take care of my kids and plus 
it's expensive too hiring somebody who  
will take care of your babies right exactly 
they're all Japanese and i don't know their  
language in the two years that you stayed in Japan 
did you ever try to learn how to speak Japanese  
no everything is transitioning to me you know like 
from 2004 i was moved here in the US and then uh  
nine months or six months later oh no maybe nine 
months later i moved you know we left the US we  
left 2005 so then we stayed there 2008 basically 
it's like on the move i'm like go go go go  
it's a lot of transitioning a lot of adjustment 
um everything moved too fast for me yes how was  
your transition stage because you you weren't 
even a year yet in the US and then here comes  
the job offer in Japan which Troy accepted so 
were you like excited were you like hesitant uh  
scared at first because just basically the three 
of us of course when you're when you basically i  
start embracing it you um you basically have to 
adjust it you have to accept the fact hey your  
husband get a job you have to go if we you're left 
behind you know you have to go with him so yeah
like being i think it's natural to us as a 
filipino that we adapt fast come on let's go
but it's packing bags even 
though inside you you're scared  
you know if you don't know what's gonna happen 
you don't know what's you're waiting for back  
there but your but the but the uh the parents the 
presence of your parents how long have you been in  
Japan before your parents could join you i think 
we're already maybe uh less than a year i think um  
before i have my due date i think um because of um 
shannon is born july 5th maybe around may or june  
got them we started processing the paper 
luckily i had we knew like he had a co-worker
who's an American and then who has 
also a filipino wife um who helped us
got us the idea to bring them there and 
help us out was the process difficult to  
bring your parents in Japan it was just a tourist 
visa right mm-hmm a tourist visa I can't remember  
um that's one thing uh yeah i don't really have 
i can't remember the yeah because i guess because  
you can't remember any stress I guess it was so 
easy huh it was so safe to say yeah well what  
happened was i think we fill out the paperwork 
uh basically it was uh the naval ah what's that
you know composter like a naval um office uh there 
they processed it ah the admin you know all you  
have to do is submit a paper and i'm not sure 
if we had the supporting docs documents i think  
we did we have to have a like an order you know 
before we go here before we went to Japan you have  
you have like a paper they call it orders you know 
the military that pay you have to move here and  
then you know work here or even a military if your 
my spouse is a military they have to have an order  
or like that signed that hey official paper 
that yeah you could come here in the uh  
in Japan something like that so when you move 
back to the us after two years did you consider  
uh did you consider asking your parents to join 
you in the U.S even for a tourist visa again
well the motivation behind bringing them here 
is first it's getting harder for me to support  
them back then you know um second my 
sister, my youngest sister who's in
California you know she has she's having a 
baby or she already have a kid both of them  
are working and um in order for her you know to 
take care of the kids and not entrust them to
babysitting babysitter that's when 
the time i you know i got a chance to  
um bring them here so your parents are here in the 
us but they are in California but it was you who  
it was you applied for the petition for 
them or it was your sister yeah uh it  
was me because main thing uh I have a job and 
then of course my husband assists me for that  
uh i think I asked them for supporting documents 
uh from them but it's mainly you have to have a  
primary sponsor and then a secondary sponsor so 
was their visa a tourist visa or are they are they  
no permanent residents um i think when i got them 
there for permanent residence i didn't do the you  
know how it is a tourist visa it is really hard 
here it is asking a lot of stuff you know even a  
rich family or a rich person that had money uh 
it's really hard it's like going through a needle  
yeah it is it is hard so um it's 
really um disappointing to hear  
other people does that you know we did it the 
right way i spend a lot of money uh you know  
um supporting them and then processing the papers 
everything that you know before they even come  
here all the paperwork all the fees had to pay so 
how long was the process did your parents wait uh  
months to get here for their petition to be 
approved if I remember correctly maybe a year  
or a year and a half out of the paper and then 
paid all the fees send them the money to get all  
the necessary documents and then uh prepare all 
my supported documents in this side and then their  
side so yeah maybe a year and a half um just in 
time you know for them to come here my sister yeah  
she has her baby and i was able to help them so 
you petitioned your your parents both of them but  
uh once they got approved do they go straight 
to um California or they spent uh time first  
no they come to me first i had to get them buy 
them the ticket um you know stay here for maybe  
maybe two three weeks they stayed here i took 
them back to um California i uh i brought my mom  
first because my mom never travel ever travel on a 
plane never ever left other than riding in a plane  
traveling by herself nope she won't be able to 
do it so i had to of course take my time off  
and then uh got there got her and bring 
her here and since my dad is i think a  
month later or two months later um my dad came 
here he got behind because he has something  
you know like settle things first because uh 
my sister is still there our house in TayTay  
he has to like put in order things i can't 
remember why did he really left behind i  
think maybe financially too so it's a lot of 
money so I told him Mama first because mama  
can't travel by herself so i had to come there 
and get her and then i'll just send you the  
ticket and then just fly here you mean you went 
back to the Philippines yeah i went back to the  
Philippines to bring my mom oh okay wow a lot 
of money and it's a really an expensive trip  
so yes kids are you know still young that 
time and it's not as expensive you know we're  
able to afford to do those things i wanted to ask 
you from from the Philippines you moved to the US
and in less than uh in less than a year you moved 
to Japan when you get to the us when you came here  
were you already driving in the Philippines 
and no so you have to learn yes i did learn  
trust me it is um yeah i've never learned how you 
know i basically i had i had to force myself to  
learn how to drive i've never experienced to ride 
in a you know like a public transportation here  
i rely on my husband all the time for five years 
during that time you were already working no  
so i had to mainly focus on the kids so i didn't 
work for five years uh i don't drive i always  
wait for him to drive me around and then um 
when they're starting to go to school that's  
when the time um yeah he said you have to go start 
learning how to drive you can't be relying on me  
all the time uh we pay a school you know like 
that oh so you went you went to a driving school  
yeah i did too now i want to ask how many 
tests did you did you take before you
for the benefit of my viewers the reason 
why we asked is because it's very common  
for a Filipina it's seldom happens that that 
a Filipina who is new to driving will pass  
the test the first time but that's one thing 
that um that kind of was like a lesson for me  
that for people who wants to come here 
they should learn how to drive first  
yeah it's so much easier for both the husband 
and the wife when you know how to drive  
because you have freedom and you're not relying 
on your husband and then especially if you guys  
have kids or you know like have a Filipina from 
there and then have already kids and brought their  
kids here yeah you have to learn how to drive so 
how was Troy's um temper when he was teaching you  
was he he's really patient but of 
course he uh you could tell he's annoyed
you know like probably scared so it took you five 
uh I mean you you you were a full-time mom for  
five years and then uh what job did you apply for 
when you when you finally decided you you wanted  
or you needed to work so at first you know like 
maybe the the kids are maybe three years old or  
years old i'm trying you know 
like in Sam's club or Walmart  
i'm you know i'm not having any luck 
but um when i was in Japan i did work  
for maybe two to three weeks in um uh what do 
you call that the department store of the base
