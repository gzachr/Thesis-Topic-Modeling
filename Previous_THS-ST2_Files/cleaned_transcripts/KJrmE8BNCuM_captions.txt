Hi guys! This is Kelly 😊 Welcome to my channel.
Today, I’ll be doing a little version of ‘Home Cafe.’
[It was ECQ when filmed]
Since the community quarantine, we can’t really go (dine-in) to the cafe, restaurants, etc.. T_T
So yeah! I’ll be having home cafe here in my house and I’ll be making Croffle today.
This is Croissant + Waffle!!
This is a trending dessert in Korea 🇰🇷
Then, let’s get started~
A perfect day for dessert ✨
This is the ready-to-bake frozen croissant that I bought 🥐
Watching croffle in YouTube, I really wanted to try it out… I super recommend this frozen dough 💖
My gosh~ Look at this! Super in love 🥰
First, have the dough coated with sugar! It will make it taste better later on hehe
But don’t coat it with too much sugar.
Since the dough softens as it defrosts, please be extra careful. I was really surprised too LOL
Shake shake shake 🤩
Not a cooking YouTuber tying hard to explain HAHAHA
We are now ready to make croffle! Have the machine pre-heated (?)!
I applied the olive oil on the pan~ I don’t even want to imagine the dough sticking to the pan 🥺
Increase volume for the fantastic sound HEHEHE
The sound is crazy woahhh
I’m craving for it again…
We’ll wait for 5 mins!
Look at this~~~~ This just looks so yummy 😋 
Okay, time to make this crispier! The answer is AIR!!!!
Tbh, this process is super important and not doing it will taste SO different (and yes, I’m being over-acting.)
Time for some drinks 🍹 
This is homemade lemon syrup! Thanks to Mom, Aunt Riel (Mom's friend), and my lovely girls who made it 😘
Put enough syrup in the glass. How much you put will depend on personal preference of the sweet level!
Please have enough syrup as well not just the lemons HAHAHA
Well, I think I need more syrup 😂
I really love opening the can/ popping the bottles because of the sound! I always do it for my family. #tmi
I’ll add some sparkling water!
Mix well~ (My sister’s telling me what to do next. She’s actually the barista of the house 😆)
🧊🧊🧊🧊
Add rest of the sparkling water~~~ I’m already excited to eat YAY
The croffle is tastier with the whipped cream ❤️
Look at this~~ Doesn’t it look so tasty??
Lemonade + croffle = 🥺💖 (Perfect)
Finally tasting time~~~
(Why can’t I slice it… gosh;;;)
Alright, I will use my hands instead.😅
Hands are the best!
Yum 🤤
