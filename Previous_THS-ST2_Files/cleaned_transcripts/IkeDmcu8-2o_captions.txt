right now and i cannot even begin to tell you  
about all the comments and and people said how 
you know the way that it touched their heart and  
and even guys or said man i didn't 
really expect it but you know  
uh it really tugged at my heartstrings and 
i i teared up a little bit i heard that  
i teared up a little bit so many times and 
and uh and i really appreciate that and hey  
i'm not making fun of anybody i was the first 
one to tear up on that and maybe that's what  
caused that uh reaction in people and a lot of the 
filipinos a lot of the ladies did like that story  
and i'm so glad and i was able to share that 
with you this is actually the sequel to that  
and this covers the time from i left you back 
whenever we were in the taxicab and uh or not  
the taxi cab we were actually in her employer's 
car uh leaving the airport and i reached over  
and i put my hand on her her little leg there and 
she grasped my hand and and we knew at that point  
that we were together so that's where 
i'm at that's where this story starts and  
as i was sitting in the car that night uh i was 
experiencing something i'd never experienced  
before i'm a small midwestern guy i grew up in 
the midwest of the united states of america and  
i'd been a few places i think i had flown to 
london one time way back and shoot i don't even  
know 1985 i think and and experienced that and 
that was great other than that i really hadn't  
traveled i think i'd been to florida once so yeah 
all my traveling and everything had been since  
i met my wife from the philippines so there i was 
in the back of the car and you know we walked out  
of the airport changi airport in singapore 
and where my wife was living at the time  
and i walked out and that humid hot humid air 
it was seemed like it was about 10 o'clock at  
night i'm not sure the time but it just kind of 
hits you like especially if you're from the u.s  
you know we don't get that kind of hot air that 
often it it happens that way in the summertime  
but we i walked out and we all walked in and we 
found our way to their uh volvo station wagon uh  
that they had this pretty good employer that she 
had they were a canadian couple and we still keep  
in touch and our friends on facebook to this day 
we've actually went out they live in connecticut  
uh now on the east coast of the united states 
and we go out and visit them from time to time  
and hadn't been out there in years we got to 
get out there definitely since the pandemic  
but anyway there i am in the back of that car 
and we're pulled away and it's a divided road  
you know of course we i can't remember singapore 
whether they switch wet they may be on the left i  
don't know uh a viewer could probably tell me that 
one of you uh ladies in singapore that works could  
could readily tell me that but as i as i'm 
sitting in the back seat you know it's just a  
it's an overwhelming sense of newness that's 
just rushing past my eyes i mean the trees the  
the whole both sides in the middle were just lined 
with trees at that time and they were just set up  
in a perfect row and i'm just looking at these all 
these exotic tropical trees as we're driving down  
into singapore on the way to the hotel and uh just 
the sights and the and and the sounds of singapore  
even late at night it was well in the darkness 
by this time so we got we got back to the hotel  
or got to the hotel where i was staying i had no 
idea was going to be like i thought it was going  
to be pretty nice i'd seen pictures and and flora 
had told me that you know it's a pretty nice place  
actually i found out that she lived within walking 
distance of that hotel her employer lived in this  
high rise they had the whole floor 20 something 
floor i don't know they had the whole floor their  
company paid for so anyway we we drove up to the 
hotel i got out flora got out and and i grabbed a  
bag and she grabbed some bags and there was there 
was some a guy that came out to help with the bags  
and he was from originally i guess maybe he grew 
up in singapore all his life but he he was his  
his heritage he was from india i knew that because 
he was a a sikh and he wore the very colorful uh  
you can call it what you want it's a it's a cloth 
head dress i'm not going to go far and try to  
misname their costume or their their manner of 
dress i wouldn't do that but you know they had the  
beard and you know they had the the headdress and 
they helped us into the hotel or he helped us into  
the hotel and i went to the desk and flora stood 
back here and uh you know i'm kind of nervous i'm  
looking around and she was very helpful i like 
that i mean i mean i knew her from the phone i  
knew her on on you know on the telephone basically 
and i had a picture of her uh way back you know uh  
when we started talking she'd sent me a picture 
so i'm just kind of you know new to this whole  
thing new to singapore i've got this this little 
lady there behind me that i don't know very well  
but i i knew you know we talked a lot and uh we 
exchanged a lot of you know conversations and  
so i felt like i knew it really well but this is 
the first physical face-to-face uh meeting that we  
ever had so i go up to the desk and you know these 
nicely dressed uh seek guys were there behind the  
desk and they're very professionally taken care 
of my booking my reservation and you know you give  
the credit card and this and that and and then 
you know they point this way and there's a guy  
that you know has your luggage on the card and 
he pushes it to the elevator and we go up to i  
don't even know what floor is pretty high orchard 
parade hotel is the name of the hotel and it's  
right there on on orchard road in singapore and 
if you've ever been to singapore and spent more  
than you know two hours there you probably ended 
up on orchard road and it's a beautiful beautiful  
place to be uh all the shopping and everything is 
there so you know this was a nice place and so we  
we went up and we're standing there side by side 
you know and i mean you know i'm not tall i'm  
five foot ten but she's like right here there's 
a little lady standing next to me and i'm just  
like well you know uh you know i'm just so 
glad to be there with her so glad to see her  
you know i'm squeezing her hand she's you know 
probably who knows i don't remember exactly all  
the details but you know we're rising up there and 
the door is open and the guy leads us to this room  
and you know he makes us he says just hold on he 
opens the door pushes the luggage in we follow  
and he puts it up whatever he does does a 
quick room check and uh you know he leaves  
i don't even know if i tipped him i i usually 
try to tip people uh maybe i don't know if  
it's proper in singapore to tip or not but 
anyway he departed the room so there we stand  
uh you know in in this nice hotel room you know 
it's it's it's adorned very beautifully the bed  
spreads the curtains had a really nice carpeting 
on the floor had marble floors the whole bathroom  
was like made out of marble and and like a 
gold you know all the fixtures were really nice  
and we just kind of looked around the room a 
little bit you know and and you know we were there  
together for the first time for the first time 
we were alone so you know like most couples um  
you know probably what's going to happen next i 
mean you know i don't want to get too graphic but  
we decided it was time to go get something 
to eat so we headed out of the hotel and  
that night we went to uh we went to a place 
called newton circus hawker center and uh yeah i  
i'll leave all the other details to your own 
imagination uh you've had those experiences  
yourself so you know i'll obviously bore you with 
that or embarrass my my wife in any way uh but we  
went to this it was it was so just surreal again 
you know we walked out of the hotel and uh you  
know we did a lot of walking it was dark it was 
seemed like it was eleven eleven thirty i thought  
are they gonna i asked her are they gonna have 
food this late you know and of course again i'm  
from the midwest everything pretty much you know 
we've got some places a few places stay open late  
but you know it's it's just it's a few far and 
few between or few and far between whatever you  
want to say but here this is singapore this 
is a huge huge uh for me it's a huge city a  
beautiful city so we walked and we walked and we 
come to this little place called newton circus  
and i've never been to a hawker center i didn't 
really know what it was i had an idea my idea  
was you know people are going to be shouting hey 
come over here and try this food you know that's  
not the way it was but it you know i had some sort 
of mental picture of what it might be like and so  
we go of course she had been there so many times 
so you know on sundays all the uh all the ofw's  
the overseas filipino workers if they work in 
uh you know as a domestic helper or they work  
construction or some type of maintenance all 
you know the filipinos the indonesians there's  
tons and tons of filipinos in singapore so you 
know they get to go around and visit the city  
and i've experienced that a few times we went 
back and it's like man sunday it's just full  
blast it's filipinos all the time you know and 
and that's great so we went to newton circus and  
we're just walking around and i'm like looking 
at each stall and she says oh this is this and  
she seemed to know all the terminologies she 
seemed to know all the foods and probably not  
all but she knew a great deal about the foods 
there and this was a great place to stop and eat  
and i think we got this dish and i should have 
looked it up before i'll look it up later i'll  
try to put it in the comment section but we had 
this uh i had this dish and i believe it was squid  
i thought man you know i'm not gonna come all the 
way to singapore and order a freaking hamburger so  
you know i want something you know something 
out of the ordinary something that you know  
is the spice of life so i ordered this it's 
called sotong and it was uh it was a squid it had  
the greatest spices you'd ever want to try 
and of course you get some rice with it  
and and i ordered chicken rice on the side so 
i got chicken rice and sotong and uh in a nice  
bottle of tiger beer and so that was tiger beer 
is a pretty good lager i i enjoyed that and and  
it's it's kind of like a bud light it's kind of 
like a miller light something like that if you're  
you know from the u.s and so you know we we sat 
and we ate there and we we learned a little bit  
more about each other and again we had talked for 
hours and hours and hours over the months previous  
to me actually showing up there you know in in in 
singapore so then you know it's time to go back  
to the hotel it's getting really late uh i 
had been already been on a 20-plus hour flight  
and uh so we're just kind of enjoying the walk 
back and it was pretty warm for me you know uh  
i wasn't used to that kind of heat and it was 
december so i definitely wasn't you know in  
the states it's always cold in december so i 
definitely wasn't ready for that but you know  
it was kind of warm and it's more walking than 
i really uh on a regular basis ever have to do  
so it's it's it's a little uh tiring or a little 
bit hot and so i never will forget just one little  
side we walked by and there was this bicycle 
just kind of leaning up against some bushes  
and this is this is a beautiful country 
if you've never been to singapore  
it's the most modern city i've ever been in i 
mean it's more modern than any city in the united  
states don't think i'm going to some third world 
country because i'm not this place is absolutely  
beautiful and i've been back a few times and 
it just gets more beautiful each time i go back  
so you know we go back and there's this bicycle 
leaning against the bushes and i said aren't they  
aren't they afraid somebody's going to steal 
that and she said oh no no they're not going  
to steal that it's a very honest country besides 
that if somebody gets caught stealing a bicycle  
there's you know there's punishment for it in in 
other words you know singapore they make laws but  
then they enforce their laws they're not like the 
united states you can do whatever you know it's  
really depends on your social status you know how 
many times have you heard a a judge or something  
like that gets a dui you think he's spending a 
night in jail but you and me we would we would  
spend the night in jail automatic uh but anyway 
singapore whatever laws they have on the books  
they enforce and so the bicycle's just sitting 
there by itself somebody probably came back hours  
later picked it up and went on their way so we 
walk and we get back you know to the hotel and  
it is pretty late uh it's probably almost two in 
the morning before i got to bed and she had to go  
she lived again a short distance away but she had 
her responsibilities still and they really i'll  
have to give him credit they really let her have 
a lot of time for those five or six days five days  
i think that that i was there and so she had to 
leave and i hit the pillow about two o'clock in  
the morning after a shower and i was just lights 
out right i mean it was uh i was part of that bed  
so so anyway uh it seemed like i laid down and 
it couldn't have been it didn't seem like it  
couldn't have been more than 20 minutes but it was 
about 5 30 in the morning the hotel phone is just  
ringing off the hook you know it's kind of like 
that old-fashioned ring it's almost like you know  
it's going to fall off the off the nightstand or 
something like that and i grabbed the phone and  
you know i'm like yeah it was it was floor on the 
other end she'd already been up she'd done her her  
duties her responsibilities i think she had to 
cook a little breakfast she had to uh she had  
to um walk a dog and you know some stuff like 
that and she was she was excited she was ready  
to come see me and you know as sleepy as i was 30 
minutes probably or 20 minutes i was up out of bed  
had my shower i was down in front and actually 
had to wait on her for a little bit and i found a  
bench there as concrete bench and i sat down there 
and there was a like a crosswalk there i knew  
that you know she would have to come that way 
so i sat there and just waited on her i figured  
if i started walking around looking around i might 
get lost because i mean hey it's it's small town  
guy in a big city right so i saw her she had 
her hair all pulled back in a little ponytail  
and she was just you know looking for me and 
and she was excited i was excited to see her  
so you know we we met up she found me and she said 
you know we're gonna go to the botanical gardens  
in singapore today and so i said okay what you 
know i don't know anything about the town so i  
said well let's find something to eat first and we 
walk down orchard road and kind of off down below  
there's a there's a burger king and it was kind of 
a welcome sight for a small town guy from america  
uh you know after all the the the variety of 
things that i'd seen burger king sounded like  
a good option so we went there and sat down and 
it's funny in burger king you get the same kind  
of meals but instead of a ketchup pack you get hot 
chili garlic sauce and our chili sauce in these  
little packages and you you know they singaporeans 
they eat chili sauce on about everything  
so i get my i try the charlie the charlie 
the chili sauce and it was fine i like kind  
of like hot foods anyway and then we got 
up and we we started walking and i believe  
we caught a public bus which was a 
beautiful clean modern public bus  
for just a few just 30 cents or something 
like that and it took us pretty close to the  
botanical gardens and we got out and you know 
we paid our little entrance fee and went in  
and we walked around there and the botanical 
gardens is really old uh it's it's one of the few  
tourist attractions or anything that 
was still standing in 1942 in february  
when the japanese invaded and took singapore from 
the british it took them like from the 8th of  
february to the 15th of february and they had no 
history buff but i did look this up a little bit  
uh it took him a little while but that was 
that was uh the british fleet had a really big  
stronghold there and the japanese came in and they 
took singapore and the botanical gardens was like  
one of two major structures that was left standing 
i mean it must have been a horrific battle it was  
called the battle of singapore so anyway this was 
still standing so it has a really rich history and  
it's been tended and taken care of the japanese 
actually really appreciated you know the garden  
that whatever that that's what one thing they left 
so we went through there and uh you know you can't  
see the whole botanical garden in a day if you 
if you can if you do you're a better man than me  
but anyway they have orchids they have everything 
every kind of plant you can imagine i remember  
this big pond we took a picture you know of course 
it's a man-made pond it's got a you know brick  
wall all the way around it and had these big i'll 
call them lily pads out there just covering the  
water with these beautiful plants coming up and 
you know maybe there were some ducks out there  
i don't really know but we sat there and we 
took you know pictures of each other and then  
some couple come by and took some pictures of us 
we we still have those pictures in fact back then  
i had a camera and and we had those we had 
those pictures developed in a camera shop there  
in singapore and i have this little flip booklet 
that's still got those pictures in them of course  
flora she's she loves pictures and she had some 
of them remade and made bigger and all that but  
that was uh the botanical gardens was an 
amazing amazing place but the thing the  
reason i wanted to tell you about that is 
as we were walking through we saw this this  
big gazebo you know just a covering to get out of 
the sun and so we walked in there and we sat down  
for a little bit and you got to realize i 
hadn't been in the country even 24 hours yet  
and you know i was still mentally reeling 
from all the different experiences the side  
sounds tastes of singapore meeting my 
the new woman in my life you know in this  
great hotel that we're at and we're walking around 
and just the whole experience is overwhelming and  
i can remember sitting there i can remember 
like still right now if i think about it  
looking out over the gardens through the 
archway of that gazebo and i don't know  
there's this weird thought that just kind of 
come in my head and said i'm actually here
and i really just let that sink in for a little 
bit i'm actually i'm actually here and uh i'm here  
in a country that i didn't even know existed 
really i think i you know casually heard of  
singapore thought it was a city didn't know what 
country it was in found out actually it is a  
country it's called a city state but i realized 
i was actually on the other side of the world  
and i was with you know this woman that i 
thought i was in love with and turned out i was  
and it just really sank sank in and at the 
same time there's this realization that  
i knew i was never going to be the same again
because you know some of you 
might be at home in the u.s or  
you might be in the philippines i don't know where 
you're at you may never have experienced travel  
but travel changes you and if there was anything 
that i could say to people across the world  
it would be this get out and travel and see how 
the rest of the world lives because once you do  
that and you experience you you realize really 
especially if you've only been in your country  
you realize that you and your group of people in 
your country are not the only people in the world  
now you may say well i know that we've seen him 
on the news but until you go until you travel  
until you see people living in a tow you take the 
way you live and turn it completely on its head  
until you see that that there's thousands 
and thousands and millions of people  
who live lives so completely different 
from the way that you live your life  
and yet they still live a good life and you know 
i've found no matter where i travel whether it's  
vietnam whether it's thailand philippines 
you know i've been to hong kong uh you know  
we've we've been a few places we're not like world 
travelers or anything i'd like to be and i will be  
i confess that out loud we're going to introduce 
a lot more traveling but i would say to travel  
for sure and i'm not talking well you 
know i hear a lot of people in the states  
well i've got 50 states i haven't seen yet well 
yeah but you have a pretty good idea one walmart  
pretty much looks like the rest and a popeye's 
fried chicken you can find in la or you can find  
it in new york city you know it's pretty much the 
same and there's a lot of beautiful things in the  
united states and i plan on seeing a lot more 
of those you know we've done our fair share of  
traveling in the united states so so anyway you 
know we were there and i realized that i was on  
the other side of the world i was with the woman 
that i loved and the just the gravity of that
really changed who i am and who i was on 
the inside and you know we had a lot more  
uh little travels within singapore we would 
take a bus here and there and we'd walk  
and she walked so much and she said so well we 
can just walk everywhere like yeah you're you're  
108 pounds and you know you've got this little 
tiny pair of flip-flops on and i probably was 160  
pounds back then or 165 and i don't think i'd ever 
wore flip-flops in my life and i had some kind of  
tennis shoes or something then we went 
and bought some and then she blistered  
my feet we walked so much you know we went to 
chinatown we went to uh the the uh indian part of  
of singapore we went to hindu temple we went to 
buddhist temples we went all over the place i  
wanted to see you know everything that i could we 
saw the you know the great fountains the merlions  
and all this kind of stuff we walked down the 
clark key which is you know right there the river  
that goes by there's a lot of small shops 
and some beautiful restaurants we ate dinner  
on this boat this set out there in the 
river and we did a lot of things um  
you know and and it was such an enjoyable 
experience but so short five days right and that  
was the first time that me and my now wife were 
ever together so it was getting close to the end  
of the uh getting close to the end of the trip 
for me and i'm going to go to the the last  
night that i spent in the orchard parade hotel 
and she came you know her employers knew that  
you know i was leaving the next night i met 
them and they were fine folks very fine um
so it was late and i had a lot 
to pack and she was there with me  
i actually had bought several things and i didn't 
think i was going to get it all in the luggage  
but she knew i was tired and she said honey 
why don't you just get some sleep you got  
to get up early tomorrow and you know we got to 
go to the airport i'll take care of the packing  
so i said okay you know and 
i got my shower and you know  
went to bed and the last thing i remember 
i i as i kind of raised up and i can still  
remember seeing the back of her head you know and 
i think i talked to her a little bit but she was  
kind of sitting on the floor and she was packing 
my things and you know i never really had anybody  
uh actually pay that kind of attention and care 
to me before you know she was she made sure i was  
taken care of and i made sure she was taken care 
of you know some people think that some people say  
well you know now that you have her she's going 
to wait on your hand and foot i never wanted that  
never desired that i respect her and this little 
story is one reason i do i remember looking at her  
you know the last thing i remember and she was 
packing my stuff and i went off to sleep well  
you know the alarm or she woke me up or whatever 
i don't know i don't really remember but i do  
remember this and i found out later she spent the 
whole night right there at the foot of the bed  
going through my stuff and she got it all packed 
up and she said you don't have to worry about it  
it's all together and what i didn't realize 
about an hour later or two hours later  
we were sitting in the changi airport and it was 
early morning there wasn't a lot of people there  
yet and my flight was a pretty early flight 
and we stopped and we sat down at this  
little cafe right there in the changi 
airport little food area a little cafe  
and sat outside some tables i didn't think they 
were open uh so we sat there and we talked and
that's one of the hardest conversations 
i think i ever had in my life  
because you know you're at the peak you know 
you're at the peak you finally you've been to asia  
you you've you've met the woman of your dreams you 
think you know the limited experience i had i was  
pretty satisfied i was sold and we're sitting 
there talking and it was really hard to talk  
about the obvious thing that i was getting ready 
to leave and she was going to go back to work  
you know and and that's hard to take so we kind 
of avoided the conversation a little bit and  
finally i i just remember saying you 
know i don't i don't really want to go  
i knew i had to but i didn't want to go and 
she said i know honey but you know this is  
this is what we've got to do you know and 
i had to think you know as i was thinking  
about this video what was going on inside of 
her head here she is you know she's a filipina  
and she's just amazed right she works for expats 
in singapore you know did she have a great five  
days that she could look back on maybe with 
some regret or maybe fondly i don't know  
do you did she think is this guy ever going to 
call me again even though i assured her that you  
know hey we were we were going to be together 
but how many times does that happen to somebody  
some made in singapore and and the guy never 
calls back he never comes back you know it's  
just all about one thing you know so right before 
i had to go to the gate she gives me this card
you know i just it just tore my heart 
up you know she gets me this card  
and a picture of her and she'd been up 
all night long i didn't realize this but  
when she gave me that she said yeah i was 
up all night and she wrote me like this  
four page letter both sides i mean 
and of course it was in an envelope  
so i took that to my gate and i checked my 
luggage and i got on the plane and headed back
and i'll tell you this
i did not dare open that letter on a plane  
there was no way that i could have kept my 
emotions together in that public of a situation
so i waited and i read the card and looked at the 
picture from time to time and changed airplanes
and i got home and
opened that letter up and just sat there you know 
hey we all do it guys whether you want to admit  
it or not you know a situation like that where 
that little lady she wrote all those words you  
know that was just like and you know it's kind 
of if you have a filipina you'll relate to this  
especially you know if they're still learning the 
english language it's it's in that broken you know  
uh imperfect english they think they have to be 
perfect but we love the imperfect english don't we  
we love it it's so cute you know and that's 
one reason that makes us fall in love with them  
and i opened up that letter at home and it's a 
good thing i lived by myself at the time because  
it was tough to take it took me about a good 
half an hour i finally regained my composure and  
we began again calling you know back and forth 
and uh that was december early in december  
like i think it was uh i got the paperwork 
filed i filed for what they call a k1 visa  
and which is a a fiance visa they call it i got 
a lawyer i probably wouldn't do this today but  
i got a lawyer and an immigration lawyer 
and i filed a k-1 visa and in august 15th  
of that year she came and she landed in st louis 
missouri and we've been together ever since  
and uh she loves to travel she's she's not a 
stereotypical filipina is if there is such a  
thing and i don't think there really is because 
every one of them has different experiences but  
she worked nine years in singapore and her mom 
had went over before and i mentioned this before  
in in another video they went to singapore 
her mom first and she followed a year later
to save the family because her father was sick he 
just smoked too much he i think he had cancer and  
he died and there's two young brothers that are 
in their late teens basically trying to survive  
in the philippines and the mother and daughter 
are sending money back to help them out you know  
to keep the family alive and that's what a lot of 
people don't realize you know they say about 10  
of the people in the philippines are overseas 
filipino workers and i'm going to do a video on  
that and i i hope and i think that flora's going 
to help me on that so i know i'm a little bit long
but these are some important things to me and 
important things to share and if you don't like  
them to watch the channel i mean i don't care i 
just i love what i'm doing and and i think there's  
a lot of people who do like it and and through 
the comments i've heard well 27 000 people have  
watched that one video and so i really appreciate 
you guys uh we came over here to the philippines  
this time to stay in our house and and to stay 
for 60 days and we extended it for another 30 days  
and uh but my plan is to be back full time pretty 
much full time i've got family i've got to visit  
but if you like the video please subscribe i'm 
going to keep telling stories until i don't have  
any more stories to tell i've kind of been putting 
off a story video and i've had a lot of people ask  
me i've had people yeah i really like your stories 
uh and the next one is like when are you going to  
put your wife on we want to see your wife you know 
and i told her that this morning i said i got like  
five comments last night that they want to see you 
flora so i said you know what the channel's doing  
fantastic but flora i believe that if you'd get 
on there and we'd just be ourselves the lid would  
just blow off the channel and because we have a 
fantastic chemistry with each other she's so smart  
and so loyal and so loving and so funny and such 
a sense of humor it's amazing but we'll get back  
and if you haven't subscribed to the channel again 
go ahead and subscribe if you have any questions  
or comments put them down in the comment section 
i really appreciate you guys we did just go over  
2 000 subscribers and that's exciting and as far 
as i can tell i'm just going to keep doing this so  
give me have any suggestions for videos a lot 
of you have i appreciate those and some of them  
one guy sent a video or sent a comment off of my 
poll and he wanted to know the experience of the  
overseas filipino worker and i thought that's a 
fantastic idea so i'm going to get that online  
and we're going to do that so bye for now i 
appreciate your time if you made it this far  
you're a freaking hero all right have a great 
day or night wherever you're at thank you
