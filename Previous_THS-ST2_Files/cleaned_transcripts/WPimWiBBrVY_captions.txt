would you eat fish with dessert
champorado is a sweet chocolate rice
porridge typically eaten for breakfast
it's made with glutinous rice filipino
chocolate tablets and milk i use coconut
milk
when serving you drizzle sweetened
condensed milk or evaporated milk on top
and you've got a creamy dessert-like
breakfast but wait
there's more since chemporado is
typically eaten for breakfast in the
philippines street vendors would top
champorado with
salted fish for complete breakfast i've
only tried champorado with salty fish
last year
and i freaking love it it's like having
salted caramel or
a salted chocolate chip cookie just with
fish knowing that
would you try this
