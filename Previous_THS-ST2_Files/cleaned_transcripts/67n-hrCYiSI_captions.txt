All day, all day, all day
 (oh eh oh)
I do it in my way
 (oh eh oh)
All day, all day, all day
 (oh eh oh)
I don't care what they say
Oh eh oh
All day, all day, all day
Oh eh oh
I do it in my way
Oh eh oh
All day, all day, all day
Oh eh oh
I don't care what they say
Oh eh oh
Today's my day, my year, my century
And you can't take any of it from me
We got a place in all this crazy
You're not alone, cause we came a long way
None of this waiting for
Someone to open doors
I'm so above it
Baby, I love it
All of this shake and go
I don't see hate no more
I'm so above it
Baby, I love it
All day, all day, all day
Oh eh oh
I do it in my way
Oh eh oh
All day, all day, all day (oh eh oh)
I don't care what they say
Oh eh oh
All day, all day, all day (oh eh oh)
I do it in my way
(Oh eh oh)
All day, all day, all day (oh eh oh)
I don't care what they say (oh eh oh)
I took a chance and chased it with my fears
And now I can stand on top of the world's sphere
In a romance with being my own way
Freed up my hands to hold onto you here
None of this waiting for
Someone to open doors (open doors)
I'm so above it
Baby, I love it
All of this shake and go
I don't see hate no more
I'm so above it
Baby, I love it
All day, all day, all day (oh eh oh)
I do it in my way
(Oh eh oh)
All day, all day, all day (oh eh oh)
I don't care what they say (oh eh oh)
All day, all day, all day (oh eh oh)
I do it in my way
(Oh eh oh)
All day, all day, all day (oh eh oh)
I don't care what they say (oh eh oh)
None of this waiting for
Someone to open doors
I'm so above it
Baby, I love it
All of this shake and go
I don't see hate no more
I'm so above it
Baby, I love it
All day, all day, all day (oh oh)
I do it in my way
(Oh eh oh)
All day, all day, all day (oh eh oh)
I don't care what they say (oh eh oh)
All day, all day, all day (oh eh oh)
I do it in my way (oh eh oh)
All day, all day, all day (oh eh oh)
I don't care what they say (oh eh oh)
