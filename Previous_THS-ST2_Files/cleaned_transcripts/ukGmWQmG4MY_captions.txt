It's like a messy, but perfect at the same time. V you always look good you my bias
Damn, look at his. Look at his jacket too this Jacket, shoes everything from the MV itself they got that colorful crazy vibe
It felt like a party to be honest too. Definitely not what I expected. I mean from the teaser itself
I mean, I feel like I had that message like, you know, call me an artist. Call me an idol. I don't care
Imma, do me I love myself kind of ish
But this just makes me more even more curious about the other songs that are coming out with this repackage
Album the music video itself. Geez

like from the colors to the vibe that MV with that song itself is literally a slap to yo face saying that
Wake up and it's a type of MV You have to watch at least multiple times because there's so much happening too. The boys
Look good. The outfits were on point. The music video was lit
There's one thing I just hope that BTS are not like rushing themselves. Like they're pushing themselves too too hard
