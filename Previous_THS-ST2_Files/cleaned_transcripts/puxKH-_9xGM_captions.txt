hello everybody this is Doug and today
I'm coming to you from Cebu City the
Philippines we are still in the
Philippines and I'm here with Molly hi
and guys the goal of today's video is to
try as much Filipino food as possible
Cebu is known as one of the food
capitals of the Philippines and they are
famous for some very great Specialties
as well as some general Filipino
Classics so we have about five hours we
have to uh try to budget our food
consumption so we don't get too full too
early and uh we're gonna do as much as
we can and unfortunately it's our last
day in the Philippines so this is going
to be a great way to end the trip so
we're off to our first stop we're gonna
have breakfast here we go all right guys
we reached our first stop it's called
snow Sheen restaurant and it says where
the people of good taste meet
so I like that I think that's a good
sign it looks really good by the way
guys stay tuned till the end of the
video because at the very end of the
video I'm going to be trying balut which
if you haven't heard of it it is an egg
that is very common here in the
Philippines where the chicken or the
duck inside is fertilized so the embryo
develops it's very common here beloved
Filipino food very intimidating to me
but for you guys I'm gonna try it and
Molly is too she's very excited
just kidding but I will all right guys
so anyway breakfast here we go
do we order here I guess we maybe order
here and then we sit all right guys
we're in the restaurant and the first
dish has arrived this is called siopao
it is a big fluffy bun this is actually
a Chinese Filipino dish so it's very
similar to like about that you've seen
in some Chinese food probably the big
fluffy pillowy bun filled with some kind
of sweet delicious meat and they
actually Mark which type of bun it is
with this uh colored dot on the top of
it Molly why don't you do the honors
take the first bite
how is it I feel good really let me try
oh yeah this looks really good so it's
got that kind of caramelized meat in
there
oh and an egg
um
and there's some sauce
spicy
sweet okay so and then in there there's
a hard-boiled egg Molly wanted me to
clarify that she's only not trying the
balloon because she doesn't like eggs in
general not because it is a fertilized
fetus inside the egg if you liked normal
eggs then you would definitely try the
balloon right definitely
anyway that's coming at the end guys
stay tuned all right guys the second
dish has arrived so here we have Mommy
it's actually called Mommy this is a
type of soup it's also a Chinese
Filipino dish it's like a basically a
chicken noodle soup but here it's made
with pork pork is super popular in the
Philippines and this goes great with the
CIO Pao this is the breakfast soup let's
give it a try and let's see how it is
got noodles a little bit of greens some
pork
delicious very salty
and you've got still The Fluffy bun to
go along with it guys I don't know if
this is allowed but I'm gonna try
dipping the scopal
in the broth yell at me in the comments
if this is uh against the rules
I think it's very good
salty and sweet the broth is Savory it's
oily you can feel it coating your lips
but it is uh super super tasty
that salty Umami flavor so we're gonna
finish this up and then we are going to
head to our next stop hopefully we save
room okay guys we are on our way to our
next stop down here in central Cebu City
stay tuned we've got lechon coming up
we've got street food and we've got
balloon
[Music]
all right guys we're at our next stop
now it is called sienti lechon here in
Cebu and in the Philippines more broadly
but especially in Cebu they are famous
for lechon lechon is a
cling a pig that's been roasted on a
spit and then they chop it up in a
variety of different ways they make sure
that they always include some of the
really crispy skin that's been nice and
crisped up very crackly they chop it up
with a big knife and yeah like I said it
is absolutely famous here so we waited
to try it until we came here to Cebu
we've also got some garlic rice which is
what it sounds like rice with garlic
very famous here in the Philippines and
delicious let's give it a try ladies
first of course Molly go ahead
oh you hear that
all right so you got a little bit of
pork Molly used to not like pork and now
on this trip you're eating so much of it
so much more
all right
all right I've got an excellent bite
here with a lot of crispy skin first
bite of lechon Cheers everybody
foreign
wow it is so juicy I think by slow
roasting the whole pig they keep all
those juices in there so juicy super
tender super flavorful now let's try a
little bit with this garlic rice and it
probably goes great together
oh
very garlic salty heavy all right guys
the last bite we want to try is with
this special sauce that it comes with I
don't think it's straight soy sauce but
maybe a little bit of soy vinegar maybe
some sweetness it was on the table so
we'll give it a dunk here a little bit
of that rice a little bit of that pork
actually a lot of that pork and here we
go
yeah
this is delicious very popular for
Filipino celebrations get a whole pig
and roast it this is incredible all
right guys that lechon was delicious we
are on the road again to our next stop
the balut is drawing ever closer with
every passing minute and I'm getting
nervous but I'm also excited because
it'll be an experience and that's what
it's all about I'm doing it for you guys
so stay tuned the balloon is coming at
the end of the video but for now we're
off to a very special iconic Filipino
restaurant and here it is guys
Jollibee how excited are you Molly
so Jollibee is a super famous
actually at this point International uh
Filipino fast food chain
there's their little mascot we're gonna
go inside they serve a bunch of stuff
but we're here for something very
special yes so here at Jollibee their
main thing is Fried Chicken which they
call here chicken Joy very nice name for
it and then they've also got Burgers
they've got hot dogs with I think
macaroni and cheese on it not sure I've
never tried it they've also got what
they call Burger steaks which are like
burgers with this mushroom sauce and
everything comes with rice it's very
good however here today we are here to
try something very special which is
Jolly spaghetti
okay and here it is do you want to do
the big reveal
oh wow obviously you got to do the
honors
since this is your favorite they have
this place in New York actually in
Midtown New York there's a Jollibee
good okay so what is it about Jollibee
spaghetti that makes it so special it's
has cheese some kind of like white
cheese on it and it has hot dogs in it
yum yes so it's sweet spaghetti and uh
it's not my favorite thing I like it
okay it's it's like total junk food
let's give it a bite here we go sweet
Jollibee Filipino spaghetti
good flavor to me a little bit strange
definitely unique but a lot of people
love it including this person
here we've got some pineapple juice
which is just sugary and delicious yeah
that's so good
yeah no it's tasty sweet spaghetti goes
that's why we came to Jollibee
stay tuned we've got more coming up soon
so we're on our way to try the next food
on our list it's actually going to be
the second to last with the last of
course being balut but the one that
we're going to be trying right now is
called and our Taxi Driver yesterday
told us about it and he said it's a
really common food with taxi drivers and
one thing I've learned is that where the
taxi drivers go to eat you should also
go because they know all the best tiny
little hole in the wall spots wherever
they work and that's where we're headed
right now I don't even know what it is I
kind of forget so we're gonna go there
check it out give it a try and uh yeah
it's gonna be fun
okay we're here and look at all of this
fried stuff what is all this can you
tell me
is
n't that it's Pork yeah
small intestine okay what about these
ones
is it really uh pork belly okay what's
this one made of
um vegetables vegetable oh we don't want
that only the pork right
and there's even some crabs there okay
so punko Bunko is just like a bunch of
fried stuff okay cool and these are just
uh this one is okay
crispy
[Music]
so this whole place is just loaded with
tables
and they're each like their own station
do you guys all work for the same
company or
so it's all one place that all serves
the same stuff but all these different
stands anyway
it's all separate okay and everything
comes wrapped in plastic so they can
quickly reuse the plates and whatnot
thank you you excited yeah
we can just share it together this is
the intestine oh pork belly and this is
intestine okay everyone's wearing these
bags ah okay yeah do I wear that because
it's very greasy all right so here is a
piece of uh intestine thank you here we
go
oh that's good
tastes like crispy bacon
it tastes like fried chicken okay now
here's the pork belly pork belly again
deep fried oh wow
see that's the competition when everyone
walks in to get them to come to their
stall
s
wow I ate the pork belly just as that
promotion started
it's delicious similar very crispy
here's a nice big
it's like chicharron
you're gonna like it this one yeah
here's a big veggie roll also deep fried
I'm gonna need a diet after this no more
fried food for like a couple weeks
foreign
[Music]
like it could almost be potato or some I
don't know some kind of starchy
vegetable cool experienced to come here
this reminds me of getting compare in
Turkey in ortakoi when you get there all
the potato sellers are yelling at you to
try to get you to come to their stall
it's a cool experience I would recommend
this come when you're hungrier though
because there's a lot of stuff to try we
only tried a few things but we've got a
bunch of other stuff crabs should we try
crabs
since it was your idea you gotta try
first I think you just dig it out with
your fingers
very fried they're very good
so this is just like the kind of the
head the back of the crumb I think they
kind of stuff it with the stuff because
I don't think the whole head is normally
filled with me like that I think they
empty it out and make maybe some kind of
a meat mix maybe and then put it back in
the shell for serving I'm not sure any
Filipinos in the comments let me know if
I'm wrong about that but let's give it a
try
oh
okay
very sweet so we're going to continue on
to the final
challenge of this video balut stay tuned
bye-bye thanks
Doug Barnard okay guys that was really
good very crispy very fried but the
experience I think is what made it so
we're gonna try to find balut right now
they just told us that it's more of a
nighttime thing or a late afternoon
thing and it's the middle of the day but
we have to go to the airport soon
however if we don't find it here I'm
gonna get it in Manila tonight so it's
coming up right after this no matter
what all right guys I'm back in Jakarta
now we couldn't find it in Cebu but uh
we're here looking for balut and I think
we found the right place I'm so nervous
uh oh gosh I think it's right there
gosh
hello
okay is it chicken or duck duck okay oh
I'm so nervous all right I'm handing the
camera off to Molly film well please
I'll do my best one try yeah seriously
or two no one
our taxi driver is coming to to come
with us to witness it's so much yeah
yeah
so can you tell me how to eat it please
do I open
can you help you poke with the stick
thank you uh this side okay
hit it here okay
okay
[Music]
oh oh oh my gosh
okay we're finding a little oh my God
Sanju you're enjoying this more than me
okay
drink the juice okay I'm gonna drink the
soup so just take a look in there first
so you can see there's a little bit of
yolk and there's a little bit of fetus
so this is the real deal here guys I'm
gonna drink the juice
it smells like chickeny broth all right
I'm gonna drink the juice it's very hot
the juice is good yeah
let's open a little bit more of this and
we can see if we can get a better look
at
[Music]
baby duckling yeah
okay good
are you gonna eat one with me okay good
oh should I put salt yeah okay
very nice okay well you have to drink
your soup first
so how many days
how many days incubation
17 days yeah I heard that's the longest
I read online that it's 13 to 17 days 17
is the best time but 13 is less feathers
and softer beak so guys in here just to
recap we've got uh
a fertilized duck egg so the embryo has
started to form
and oh did you eat it you show me how to
do it
oh you finished one bite okay I'm gonna
do two bites
come on is it good did you put the sauce
on it yeah I'm gonna put
stent okay okay okay
so yeah is that oh is that the head yeah
okay so here we've got a small duck uh
embryo
it feels like a mix between an egg and
and something more oh you can see some
veins there some feathers developing
here
yeah there's feathers right there see
that black bit there is is some of the
feathers
and uh okay I'm not gonna I'm not gonna
dissect it anymore hot sauce please
thank you so much
so we're actually gonna do this in one
bite here okay
um
cheers to the Philippines thank you so
much for a great visit this is a really
big bite yeah two bites two bites here
we go
I'm glad you guys are enjoying it all
right here we go one bite two bites
actually if I didn't have
just do one bite
that's good yeah
yeah
thank you
so first impressions while it's still in
my mouth it tastes like a very firm egg
with some hard bits in there I'm not
getting beak and um
claws as much as just like thickness
like the body is starting to develop but
there's no difference between like the
meat and the bones of the baby yet
it's all it's just a kind of hardness
and it it tastes more like chicken than
egg food
very strong oh it's duck right sorry not
chicken duck
um
okay good good to hear
what do you say
very strong knees and very strong sex
[Laughter]
both knees and also sex to be honest
this is not that bad it's pretty it
tastes like chicken the texture is a
little strange but if you can see it
there like here is just like kind of
like egg white but it's getting a little
harder and it's weird you can because
you can see the the yolk part and then
it's turning more into the bird part
here which is all coming apart now I'm
gonna finish this and get the job done
by the way I should mention that because
I changed my plate tonight I had a
little more time and I had two beers
before this only two but I think it's uh
that probably helped a little bit all
right we're gonna finish it this is no
big deal guys I've had worse things
that bite was easier that was more eggy
the other one was harder I bit through
probably the the formation of the body
uh yeah thank you so much
it's okay thank you I want to savor it
the second bite was easy that that was
just like eating a hard-boiled egg the
first bite
a little bit rough some tough bits in
there
let me just get it done so you guys know
I finished the job
guys this is the end of the food tour
thank you so much for watching I hope
you guys enjoyed the video
subscribe if you haven't already we've
got a lot more coming from around the
world other than that see you in the
next one bye
