and you'll see funny things anything about
closer actually is uh the name of our website
is closerlives.com uh Leona and I we travel
full time we have our YouTube channel to highlight
our travels and we also have a travel blog
that we work hard on sharing accommodations
places to go Foods we eat everything it's
called genuinely on travel blog on closerlives.com
and that all started because we are both poets
who met on Instagram four years ago I'm from
Canada I'm from England we're both writers
we're both poets we started a poetry platform
page on Instagram called Closer lives poetry
and so now we have our big website called
Closer lives because it's our plan in the
future which if you're enjoying this video
please subscribe if you're gonna watch the
videos share like do all that great stuff
because we have big plans for the future not
just for our Channel and not just for ourselves
but um for the world on a humanitarian level
and this is why we've called our website closer
lives because we want to connect lives just
like we're connecting with the Philippines
through eating Jollibee so let's get started
our Instagram has now changed to generally
on travel that's right yes yeah we've changed
it because we don't write poetry anymore and
we've been traveling the world full-time for
two and a half years now so we don't have
time to write unfortunately it's gonna give
this a try straight away cheers cheers cheers
cheers to Jody B yeah it's awesome pineapple
juice for the win that's really nice that
is very nice very refreshing that's different
I've never had pineapple juice from a fast
food chain before so okay so I think what
we're so we've got a lot of different options
here I think what do we start with the chicken
or the burgers I think we saved the chicken
till last all right okay we go for the burgers
I've only got an extra large gravy where did
that goes we've got baby we've got like four
of them so okay we need forks that we're gonna
use our real Fork here so our funny story
about this apartment there's a little Tupperware
drawer here by the way we're in an Airbnb
at the air Azure residents here in the paranite
paradise area and it's absolutely fantastic
Leonia and I've been staying here for the
month it's like a getaway here in Manila it's
like like there's a wave pool and a man-made
Beach it's actually really cool so if you're
interested in that you can check our website
on coastalabs.com there's all the details
the whole blog post so if you're planning
to travel to Manila I would highly recommend
staying in this 100 and there's tons to choose
from tons of Apartments but I didn't know
that there was any utensils I was like where's
the utensils and they're like a little Hideaway
drawer right there okay all right let's go
okay try the bites together okay I'm gonna
try this first okay Halo Burger no no the
one with the pineapple Aloha Burger I was
thinking Halo Halo we didn't order that because
they didn't have it on the menu available
unfortunately but we have tried it here and
we tried that at a different restaurant so
this is the um amazing Aloha burger and oh
by the way we've never heard of this franchise
before coming to the Philippines after doing
some research obviously we're aware that you
can find it in many different countries around
the world which is really cool so we have
nothing to compare it to this is our very
first time and also I just want to add that
we are massive KFC we are yeah so we're really
going to be putting the chicken to the test
so let's take a look first here you go the
unwrapping of the burger and this is one that
has like pineapple in it right yes it does
the pineapple drink and we've got a pineapple
and a burger okay I'm very interested to try
this because I'm not a fan of pineapple and
pizza I've never tried it in a burger so I'm
very excited it's not fair you know we never
get pineapple on pizza because she doesn't
like it it's one of those things where if
you don't like it you don't like it but I
love it do you guys like pineapple pizza let
us know in the comments yeah all right I'm
going for the first bite
oh it does actually look good and it smells
good I think this is gravy as well we've got
lots of gravy um um
hey I knew
we only got one small fry gotcha fries I think
we got enough food so can't face everything
without Gonna Be A Feast for days that is
for sure okay so this is all pineapple right
I've got bacon on there no pineapple bacon
I don't know hmm
I love that I would definitely order that
over and over and over
that it's not bad I mean it's not like my
favorite the part of the sweet the sweet with
there like I don't know but that is it's good
I mean I'm not gonna say it's not good because
that is good I'm like it's interesting it's
so interested
it's like a pizza almost oh my gosh okay I
love this so if you're not a fan before that
is interesting yeah that is really interesting
but it's not bad at all this one about excited
for you can try this one you want to show
this one it's the bacon cheesy bacon cheesy
bacon cheesy yeah that's what we got here
let's have a look inside oh look at that um
yes okay it looks like it's got some sort
of like pink sauce I don't know yeah we've
heard good things about their sauces here
I like that that sauce is very interesting
I like it um that is good
you can get all that bacon um
um
that's delicious I really like this
the sauce almost tastes like uh Hollandaise
sauce or like Thousand Islands Dressing you
know I was thinking it it reminds me a little
bit of the sauce you get with eggs benedict
but no I think you're right yeah okay we're
just gonna try everything first and we're
gonna try to eat everything because you know
in order for this to be a mukbang I think
you're supposed to finish all of your food
so and also I had no idea what a mukbang was
literally until last month when we were in
Malaysia I was like looking at videos had
no idea that it didn't even existed so um
yeah hey what are you doing
this has rice can you see this has rice and
the steak okay and it has these little these
it's the Shanghai one I think it's called
so it looks like it's got these little meat
rolls or egg egg rolls spring rolls with it
but I think that's the plain rice I don't
think that's the adobo no I don't I don't
know if we got adobo rice I don't think so
I don't think we did all right so let's see
here
give this steak a go I'm gonna get a mushroom
it's a very small little potty looks like
a hamburger patty it's got the gravy in there
Cheers Cheers I love mushrooms and gravy by
the way
um fine mm-hmm I had a Patty's good no it's
not it's not like Gourmet like it's not like
that's good maybe I'd give that like a seven
out of ten yeah I'd probably say about seven
out of ten it's good yeah I'll I'll eat the
not dipped in perfect just to give it a taste
I like it oh yeah that's like a spring roll
yeah so it's like the Shanghai Shanghai something
okay I don't even need the sauce for that
oh it's better with a sauce that sauce is
great sauce that sauce is interesting that's
sweet and the sour sweet and sour but it's
almost kind of a bit Tangy like orange
very good see for me like I don't really know
a lot of what to do with plain rice so for
me I'd be dunking like water gravy on that
Rice just mix it all up yeah for sure so here's
just the nice white rice and then try it did
you eat the whole thing yeah I was I was just
uh
can I dip mine engraving plus you're going
to want to put it on that anyway that is true
yeah the race is fine is it flavored at all
or no this is like white rice oh tripped on
you sorry better on you on the table than
on you all right okay that's great too totally
would do this again
um yeah I'd put a teeny bit of salt in there
so good I love it I love gravy with mushrooms
this is so good oh there is a lot of gravy
there's a lot of gravy yeah but I'm gonna
use it for the chicken right well we still
have hot dogs and spaghetti
we have spaghetti and hot dogs and tuna pies
and chicken oh my rice and gravy that's good
I like that steak thing I'll get it again
oh yeah right so I mean it's what you get
in a burger I think yeah that's good
just gonna uh wash that down with some of
my pineapple oil okay I'm curious about this
thing that's a really good compliment for
the food though it is that's really good especially
the burger oh this is we're very I'm very
excited to try this yeah look at this we actually
have we've been here for a couple of weeks
we've not yet tried this it's got like uh
was it like rice noodles with some shrimp
and meat and some egg I'm really excited to
try this so we haven't tried this at all
it's going to squeeze squeeze lime
to do squeeze the lime oh wow oh yeah it's
okay that's so cool it's like a it's kind
of like a little coconut open it up squeeze
that out there you go get this on here oh
there's all seeds 
it's hard to grip them though okay see hey
um
and I don't know if that's what I was supposed
to do so if that's the wrong thing you guys
can tell us maybe I should say for a reason
yeah I know okay so here you want that egg
no this egg we'll just start with our egg
first and then we'll stir it all up
but they're so interesting to get like pasta
noodles from a fast food place right no not
well noodles not well yeah noodles and spaghetti
forever like a burger and stuff yeah I mean
from like a fast food like kind of chicken
or Burger chain it's not we don't that doesn't
happen in in Canada I've been to the U.S tons
and these are these are actually one of my
favorite types of noodles same same I'm very
excited I'm gonna get a little piece of shrimp
here
there's a bit of shrimp can you see hopefully
it's not too blurry oh there you go all right
ready cheers bon appetit Ive
[Music]
that's my favorite so far that is fantastic
oh yeah I really like this oh I would 100
order this again my goodness same everything
so well actually when we were ordering the
chicken you can get like six pieces of chicken
and a family size of this and then we kind
of downgraded because we weren't sure that
we was getting too much like uh this would
be too big I would totally get the big families
out of that um that is delicious oh my goodness
that's fantastic I really really love that
that's a win-win-win that's a 10 out of 10.
100 10 out of 10. that that's 10 out of 10.
oh and by the way for me the pineapple Burger
is also like 9.5 out of 10. I'd give it 9.5
not quite a ten but almost that is 10 out
of ten for me that is delicious yeah and the
steak Patty thing I think we would say is
like seven seven for me you know seven like
it's nice but I'd probably give that about
six for me just because I mean it's not there's
nothing wrong with it but there's not really
a lot going on there you know that is that
that all right I'm all over that next on the
list is the Jolly hot dog the Jolly hot dog
oh it actually is a hot dog I was craving
hot dogs so bad the other day and we went
and ordered them twice and both times one
was like a massive sausage and one of them
was like a tiny tiny like they were a little
bit hit and miss shall we say this looks like
a proper hot dog look at this yeah that I'm
excited as soon as we saw that on the menu
is that oh okay let's let's bite it together
oh okay have you guys seen like lady in the
[ __ ] Disney movie where they eat spaghetti
this is not usually our cup of tea they usually
you ready all right okay let's do it you gotta
get over the table
um
proper hot dog this is what I was craving
the other day hey
that is a bad side I said as far as hot dogs
go that's uh like 10 out of ten yeah
um that's really good you forget your man
okay hot dog for the win 100 that's the kind
of thing that after a borrow would love to
eat after a bar I mean after going to the
bar and drinking oh post bar drinking yes
what would I call it stumbling home late at
night needing to eat don't do that anymore
it's too old for that all right well not The
Stumbling party okay we're doing really well
here I mean great burgers that that hot dog
fantastic palabok wow I'm very impressed so
far all right my first taste of Jody B is
going really well okay we'll let Leon try
this first because this is the
spicy and tell by looking at the chickens
and this is it I'll show you guys this is
the spicy chicken burger you can see see the
color of the chicken it's gonna be spicy yeah
oh yeah guys oh look at that yes please I
I will happily take any spice challenge I
love spice it's my thing so get out of the
wrapper show it in all its Glory yes
but I want to get the sauce in there yeah
so let's go for this oh
um
how is it spicy wise I can't wait
oh that is great spice level I would say for
Jen's level of spice she can decide but for
me that's about seven in fact six or seven
and the Spice Girl I would say very tasty
very succulent really really nice oh I can
feel the burn a little bit um yes we haven't
tasted the chicken yet so this is our first
real little taste of the the Jollibee chicken
that's spicy for me it tastes like pranks
hot sauce you know Frank's uh Frank's Red
Hot Sauce like buffalo wings or whatever that's
what that tastes like it's really delicious
but it's tea it's bordering on a little bit
too hot and spicy for me I'm not a big hot
spicy fan that is delicious if I like spice
a bit more I would definitely eat that
that's my favorite bag I said I'm waiting
for my mind bring that spice on I love that
that is that is proper spice I like it
um but it's spicy and the best Taste of the
chicken yeah yeah that's got some good spices
doesn't it remind you of Frank's Red Hot Sauce
I have some of that in the kitchen we did
yeah that was really good and I think this
has got a bit of spices what would you rate
the burger [Music] um
the burger for itself probably I would give
it like a nine out of ten maybe maybe an eight
out of ten and the only reason I'm saying
that because number one is the sauce is too
spicy for me and but I'm trying to think without
the sauce also there's not like any lettuce
or like yeah it's just basically the chicken
sauce I give it like a seven or an eight now
this that's a good 10 out of 10 for me so
this is a tuna pie okay this is the spicy
tuna pie so it's like got the outside of like
the dessert one but it's got tuna filling
so interesting I mean all I see when I say
that is an apple pie from a restaurant we
won't mention in this video well from this
this restaurant too um
this is the spicy one
hmm
that's a long oh the long hold I'm still doing
it well I'll let you have the end bite because
it's always the crunchiest that's nice though
oh I like that a lot because obviously the
pastry is not very sweet the pastry is just
like nice and crispy it doesn't have like
the sugar on the outside but the tuna is nice
hmm I'm not getting any spice but maybe that's
just because we just eat in the bag though
um that's it let me see all the flakes of
tuna in there look at cheese in it I think
so that's so interesting because the the outside
I'm thinking like there's gonna be like a
a dessert I bet it's Savory like it's really
nice it's a really nice savory um I would
totally order that again me too I'm actually
really surprised by this I love I've never
seen a tuna pie I really like tuna and I find
it's quite difficult to find tuna when you're
like in a hurry on the go this is really good
I actually really I'm surprised by this I
really appreciate that a lot actually yeah
I I yeah I would get this like over the hot
dog I would get this over the chicken sandwich
hmm because it's different it's very unique
yeah it's very unique I I wouldn't say I wouldn't
I don't know if you used to compare that to
the hot dogs I think that's the fairest thing
to compare that to because it's like a small
light to go thing I actually probably would
buy that oh yeah that's really nice I'm just
I'm not I'm not stopping eating it so obviously
I like it you know why I like it it reminds
me of like a chicken pot pie like and I love
like a beef pot pie or a chicken pot pie where
you have like gravy and veggies and meat inside
and the pastries I love that that is fantastic
that's interesting I would almost say that's
my favorite thing on the menu so far
oh
actually yeah I have to say that that is really
good that's got to be um this reminds me of
home for some weird reason this reminds me
of like and I'm getting a teeny bit of spice
now just a little bit floating around in there
it's not spicy to me for me this is not spicy
maybe they gave us the wrong one but this
is not spicy like you're getting a tinge a
little tinge but it's like a two out of not
even like a two maybe in one hour you know
for the Spice of course oh it's got an Engraving
um I can tell you really enjoyed them oh that's
very good I really like that can I just say
as well that chain of pie I'm pretty sure
it's one of the cheapest items that we ordered
I think it was like maybe like 66 pieces uh
spicy tuna put 56 pesos so I mean that is
I mean if like I said just something quick
on the Go I mean perfect absolutely perfect
I think we're good how much time are we uh
uh 26 minutes I think are you guys gonna want
to watch this for 26 what I said still here
then it's a moot point I guess no I mean I'm
thinking for me editing like do I make a fast
video or a shorter video okay we haven't even
got the chicken eggplanted suspense with that
chicken okay so now we're gonna try the spaghetti
this is the one thing I'm a little bit nervous
about we have had spaghetti here in the Philippines
um it's it's from what we've tasted so far
it's very sweet um and it wasn't something
that we really fully enjoyed we appreciate
but we haven't fully enjoyed so but what we've
seen online of what people have been saying
that this is really really good so I'm sure
it's gonna be good we're giving it a chance
but the thing is one thing that I love like
Italy's like my favorite favorite and I love
fresh tomatoes and I love vinegary type of
tomatoes so and I love pasta love spaghetti
tomato sauce is my favorite so having it be
sweet is you know it's just that that's the
only thing but this looks pretty good let's
see oh well joined joined at the hip and joined
in our spaghetti okay I gotta get a piece
of hot dog yeah definitely gotta get a piece
of that okay and it's very thick as well thick
noodles in there yeah spaghetti noodles proper
spaghetti okay cheers
there's definitely some barbecue in there
mmm this one tastes better than that other
one that we tasted this one tastes better
than um Hunters oh oh actually actually this
is better than the place that we had tried
this
than the other one I would still give this
personally sorry I know lots of people are
a fan but I'd give maybe seven out of ten
maybe even six out of ten for me yeah out
of everything there's so many amazing things
that's the beautiful thing you can just choose
whatever it is that you love so out of all
of these things that I've tasted this wouldn't
be my thing you know like well I would be
getting the tuna pie I would be getting um
even the uh palabok I really liked I would
be getting the hot dog personally yeah I mean
if you're gonna compare like noodles would
definitely for me come before that oh it's
time for the chicken have we made it have
we tried everything well we have some desserts
over there we have we have a mango pie for
dessert and we also have a sun mango sundae
twist with graham crackers to try after two
but we are now on to the chicken and this
I told you guys we are big big KFC fans we
are so I don't mean to bring other franchises
into the mix but we kind of have to because
we all love okay I can't not compare I mean
obviously every place is different Jolly B
is going to be it's different the KFC but
it is in the back of my mind so uh yeah oh
and it's got the flags of course that's how
you know it's spicy so and you can tell by
the look too but see they've got the little
Flags here
so you can see the color difference see you
can see the color difference this one is a
lot redder the spicy one than this one um
yeah so sorry we actually got like it so you
can actually order this as a mixed bucket
so you can get like four and four or three
and three um and so uh looking good nice selection
of chicken and now different types what is
this
this is for me I'm for me it's just legs and
thighs all the way so that I'm taking that
I am a negative okay I open that feet that's
cold thanks though okay we have all the cold
gravies all up in a nice warm hot one okay
okay so we have to try it on its own first
and then we'll try Okay gravy because that's
what people say don't you dare
okay this one is going to be difficult for
me to bite and then so like the skin is like
coming off hmm I look so good it looks delicious
I'm not gonna bite just the skin yet though
I want to try the skin with the chicken so
this is not a leg I don't know what this is
this is maybe a thigh I don't know all right
all right Cheers Cheers babe
hmm
I think I need to get this can
hmm
definitely got a distinctive flavor to it
very crunchy very crunchy yeah hmm
interesting why is that what is that flavor
to it interesting I'm gonna dip it in the
gravy which I never do for me for my chicken
I always take the chicken skin off eat the
skin separate and then I eat the chicken and
I usually like like uh legs and ribs I mean
usually he usually I like the breast piece
and the rib piece because there's more skin
on it so you're dipping yeah now we'll dip
it in here a little dip recipe
then get it all nice and saucy
I kind of want it to go in all right so let's
see I'm gonna because I can't really get fit
that in so I'm gonna go this way
okay so I'm gonna get a bit of this I'm gonna
show them then Leon's just Mound down over
there
I mean chicken's really good I have to say
I'm not really getting a huge amount of flavor
from the skin you know what I mean it's not
really um there's definitely like a distinctive
kind of back taste to this to this skin I'm
not really sure whether it's like the um I
know what you mean you know what I'm saying
it's like something's kind of like there maybe
it's the type of oil they use to cook it so
I agree it's very crunchy very fresh I actually
like the taste of the chicken inside the skin
a lot nice and juicy and flavorful I have
to say I'm not enjoying that back taste whatever
that is I'm not really sure what that is but
um but I what I don't what I'm not sure about
is um the skin even though it's really nice
and crunchy it doesn't have like salt or Pepper
or season does it taste like there's no seasoning
it just feels like it tastes like breaded
chicken but it doesn't taste very much like
seasoned breaded chicken um that's interesting
yeah hmm sorry guys the chicken's really good
I mean the chicken is cooked perfectly for
sure I'm excited to try the spicy ones let's
try spacing them
the chicken here
there is oh I'm definitely gonna go for this
spicy one let's go for this
flag I think this is so cool I love that okay
I'll get the wing that's new Spicy so maybe
it's a recent finches
hmm is that the lady huh nice yeah spicy
yeah a little bit yeah it is it doesn't taste
as spicy as the burger because the burger
had spicy sauce on oh yeah I'm noticing the
spice now yeah that's spicy yeah it's not
that's not bad that's getting nasty oh yeah
you can see the space inside now yeah it's
getting crazy getting spicier
all right well that that's a bit too spicy
for me I'm not like I said earlier not a big
fan fan of spicy
that one with the gravy is much nicer than
the original with the gravy um that I don't
know why I would say that but it definitely
hurts but no the chicken's really soft and
succulent which is really nice this one hasn't
got as much of that that taste to it I'm not
a fan of the original one so I'm sorry about
that but I prefer this one for sure would
you give what would you give the original
chicken out of 10. you go first I could tell
he really doesn't like it yeah I'm not a fan
of it yeah yeah well I'm not a fan of it but
it's not no terrible um I would I would prop
I [Music] sorry not sorry I'd probably give
it five out of ten yeah I was thinking I was
gonna say around about yeah the original I
was gonna sit around about a three or four
that this one the spicy one I would I would
up that to about a six not a fan not a fan
of the chicken actually yeah but I kind of
I kind of kind of no it is what it is you
know that's the whole point of this is to
be honest um and there's lots of delicious
things to try oh yeah um yeah like sorry not
sorry KFC wins hand down hands down for for
chicken and I'm always open-minded too if
not um I would even put other franchise places
chicken ahead so yeah not a fan of the chicken
sorry not sorry um but I'm glad we tried it
we definitely won't waste it we're gonna eat
it 100 of course um but I I out of all of
these different things you know there's many
other things on the menu that I would order
such as this pineapple Burger absolutely love
the tuna pie is fantastic the pawlik was foreign
all the burgers are very good the chicken
sandwich the hot dog I loved everything actually
except for not a big fan of the spaghetti
and not a big fan of the chicken which seems
to be the most popular things but yeah I love
that you can get everything beautiful burger
for me was just a bit out there as well but
I love that you can get everything in one
spot I think that that's really handy so like
for someone like me who loves a pineapple
burger and someone else can love the chicken
and someone else can have the pie that's fantastic
okay I actually really want to eat the stuff
that I really loved because I feel like it's
getting cold now yeah so we're gonna try the
desserts so you guys can see desserts and
then we will put the chicken back in there
Let's uh yeah we're gonna try some desserts
and then we're gonna maybe put on a movie
and Munch out with all these delightful Burgers
maybe we'll enjoy uh mukbang and watch some
other people eating their Jolly Burger Jolly
Jolly Jollibee food jelly beans while we eat
ours all right so this is the peach mango
pie I wanted to try the coconut one as well
but they were all sold out uh Leon has a bit
of a thing for that so you can't try it excuse
me
now it's not as hot as it could be so I think
it would have been a lot um The Filling would
have been like runnier like if it was if it
was hot but now it's not as hot I love it
so good
yeah it always takes the big yummy pieces
out of the pies
the techniques I've perfected over the years
good mango I mean future mango okay
this is better I needed that after I needed
that uh this is this is better than other
this is better than other places that sell
similar such as like McDonald's KFC this better
better that's really really good they're pies
I'm pies for the win first I gotta save a
piece for later because it's so good definitely
a 10 out of 10 for me that and I know what
you mean like if that was a bit hotter yeah
get that kind of heat in there as well oh
yeah so it's a Sunday Sunday twirl with um
with mango and gram and chocolate I believe
yeah let me show you hmm so I don't know if
you can see in there I don't want it to spill
hmm okay let me try a bite first then I'll
just have runny um
oh well it had ice cream in it that melted
that's why okay of course because I'm realized
we'll put that in the fridge for later um
you try some of the yummy stuff with it I
just gave you ice cream tastes like a milkshake
though oh that's doubling yeah I like the
Patty ice creams melting I think that's quite
nice yeah so good I would I would definitely
order that again imagine creamy and it's got
like fruit in there and that's really good
I like that I've got chocolate in there yeah
excellent that for the win for sure yeah really
like that I'm gonna put this in the freezer
I will take this and I will take this
