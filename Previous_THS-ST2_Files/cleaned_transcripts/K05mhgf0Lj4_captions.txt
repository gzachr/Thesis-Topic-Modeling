Hi
What are you making? Kimchi Fried Rice
Are you ready for balut? 
Try everything once right? You're gonna 
be a Filipino afterward. No. That looks good.  
It's only the easiest thing to 
make. Do you like Asian food? I do
Better than mexican food. Fast food or 
Mexican food. Get kind of tired of that
Do you like rice? I love rice
Anong pangalan mo? (What is your name?) Ako ay si Desiray (My name is Desiray)
You are half Filipino now.
I'm marrying into a Filipino family. I gotta learn
After ten years? Just kidding
That smell good
Ilan taon ka na? (How old are you?)
Come on. Come on. 
22
She understands. I'm trying. 
Kamusta ka? (How are you?)
Mabuti (I'm good)
Mabuti (I'm good) Look who's laughing now.
Say hi to your face. Hi. 
Your eggs are boiling babe.
It's been a while. It's been a while
It is steaming
Oops
You are gonna get burned
Paso (burned)
Yeah. Good job. Good job.
Ang galing mo (You are good)
Ang galing ko (I'm good at this)
Good job
Sarap (It looks good)
Nagluto ng Kimchi Fried Rice (She cooked Kimchi Fried Rice)
Papakainin ko ng balut (I'll make her eat balut)
First time
You are so white
Not in the kitchen. Come on baby
Aso (Dog)
Pitbull
No don't hide behind me. I'm not in this
Ash be nice 
Stop challenging him if you can't take it. Seriously.  
Good question. I'd like to know as well
So who's messy now? I'm very messy.
I can acknowledge it. It's okay
Yes even my parents are disappointed how 
messy I am.
At least you cook. Right?
I can do all the basic essentials. That's necessary 
But for sure I'm gonna do the dishes after. Yeah?
I'll cheer you on from the 
back. I'll help you make a mess  
Hey I cleaned up my mess. You did. Oh it looks good
How much do you want? Not so much. Oh, that's 
good yeah. Thank you. Of course. Oh, it looks good
My mom likes it except when i put spam in 
it. Why? She likes ham and she does not like spam  
She's pretty okay... So that's 
ham too. That's not spam  
It tastes like um uh what are those things 
called? Chorizo. 
No, it's not. It's that lunch meat. I used to eat 
that from middle school all the time. I forget  
but they're like small and brown and they come in 
like little cans that you can get out like dollar  
tree or something it was super cheap and they were 
good but it reminds her that she doesn't like that
I bet you're not gonna 
finish that. I will. I'm hungry
Madami (A lot)
It's like a lot. It's a lot. No. It's 
not. We still got more right here too
Okay 
Do you want a spoon or a 
fork? Fork, please. I love you. I love you more
Tinidor (Fork)
you gotta let me get my notebook 
before you start teaching me stuff
which we are about to receive from your goodness through Christ our lord. Amen
wow
it tastes good. where's the music?
Do you want to try Filipino Sauce? Sure
so she's gonna try banana 
ketchup it's not tomato though
yes. you look so excited  
all right i'm not gonna put a lot of here 
wait wait let me try it on my spoon first
a little sweet no that's fine
banana ketchup
do you like it?
no it's not bad right or not it's not bad by 
itself but i should try it with other stuff
you know what it reminds me of
oh you're a great cook thank you yeah
i just follow recipes i just follow recipes 
it's kind of hard to mess up on a recipe  
i thought i'm going to be disappointed
what but
this one tastes good how do you make it you 
put the you put the spam in first to cook  
or you can use different meat like bacon or um 
ham or something else but yeah yeah you put your  
medium first to cook first and then you add in the 
kimchi so that way you can fry the kimchi a bit  
and let the meat soak up some of the 
kimchi juice for a bit and then you  
add in some sugar to kind of dilute it a 
bit and then you add in the rice mix it up  
all right we're going to tell them 
again what are they going to do
why you do this to me it tastes good it's 
not like like this one it's not like a sour  
so what did you do on that one 
sugar the sugar the sugar dilutes it  
because it doesn't taste sweet right?
no the sugar just dilutes the sour the 
kimchi so it's sour but it's not sour
and i like it
i like it
next i'll make you try kimchi jjigae. what is that? kimchi stew
so what comes with it?
chicken
um honestly the best thing to use with that is 
beef like steak. steak? cheap steak oh the smaller  
i thought it's like t-bone steak no no no no it's 
like the smaller like fajita steak kind of beef  
and tofu kimchi obviously a lot of kimchi juice i 
think. You gotta tell them in Filipino. Yes
you gotta do the translations here  
subtitles 
If I learn more Filipino then you gotta put English captions
because you gotta mix it up
i gotta learn more first before you try
are you full? no my back hurts that's why I'm sitting up straight  
why your back hurts? because i was slouching 
definitely better than eating out. that's so true  
instead of wasting money not wasting but 
spending a bunch of money. how much did we spend?
today? no for like everything on making this. well 
you already have the rice. see? sugar wasn't  even three bucks
say bigas (uncooked rice)
three dollars I think?
hmm kimchi
how much the kimchi? this is a smaller one 
so cheaper so about ten dollars in total
i think it's better to cook i like 
cooking i prefer at home meals
