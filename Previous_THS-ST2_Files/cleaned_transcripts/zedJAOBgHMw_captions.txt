today we're trying crispy luncheon 
for the first time let's dig in!
today we are trying the crispy lunches 
because the crispy lunch are just legend  
crispy okay it smells it smells amazing you 
guys it's just i can just smell it coming  
out of that box all right so what i'm going 
to do is i'm going to read the description  
right from the website to show exactly what we 
have here it is fried pork belly with astara  
which is papaya relish oh how much does that 
cost this cost 13.99 in canadian dollars okay  
let's see she's probably going right for uh fast 
food but let's open her oh and i did get rice  
rice is life it is life because i didn't want to 
do a video of filipino food without rice because  
i know how you all love your rice that's right 
everyone tells us rice is life and i think we're  
all embracing it it's so good all right let's see 
i feel like you need like stripper music for this
well it smells fantastic
i had too much of a close-up i had to cut to the 
uh i had to get the dramatic scream oh my god
i it wasn't as bad as i thought when you split 
like that i thought it went all over the what's  
gonna go over the floor but you contained it on 
the table so that's good yeah at least nothing  
we didn't lose no dead soldiers okay exactly we're 
good we're fine anyway here's the chunks of crispy  
legend which is i forget again fried pork belly 
oh it looks good oh my god that looks super  
crispy and this looks like the papaya relish if 
it tastes anything like crispy powder we're in  
for a treat oh it smells so good you guys oh 
i don't know if i'm gonna like that it's very  
vinegary that is strong but i thought that might 
be delicious yeah i mean well find out what way to  
find out here guys who is ready to try some 
crispy lunches this guy right here let's go  
this stuff smells so good it smells like oh 
it looks so crispy it smells like pork and  
fried which is good as it is oh my god 
all right cheers everybody here we go
oh they're crispy the fish people are so 
tender holy crap it's actually really so  
juicy inside that is amazing the 
ends are really crispy yeah now  
i'm going to be honest with the rice with this bad 
boy but i am like i don't know how close up you  
want on the inside of that meat but it's like 
a little shot there oh my god that is so good  
i love the crispy bites in the end the crispiness 
is fantastic it's like so crispy er yeah that's  
so juicy but it's so crispy on the outside this 
is like the best of all things pork it's like  
crispy like bacon on the outside and then juicy on 
the inside it is actually real and i'm not a huge  
pork lover i'm not a big pork eater probably my 
least favorite meat no me too but every time we've  
had pork so far here it's been so good how the 
filipinos prepare their pork is fantastic it's not  
like we get pork roast sometimes it can be dry you 
need some sauce this is done fantastically a great  
way to prepare pork milk in my humble opinion 
and a in very very north american-y kind of way  
this would be delicious with like barbecue sauce 
to dip it in but it doesn't even need it it's  
so good on its own it's so juicy though oh you 
gotta try it yeah try like scoop like a little  
is that good oh yeah the little papaya what's 
that crunch vinegary papaya in there that's  
delicious it actually really is good it takes 
up the flavor of that pork that's really good  
but did you get any of that a little 
bit no i just put some of the sauce but  
let me try some with that and i love that 
you can really taste the meat like it's not  
covered inside of the sauce or seasonings it's 
delicious yeah i've been looked excuse me one  
of the things too is like i normally like like 
the sauces and stuff but you're right it doesn't  
really it doesn't need it sometimes if you're 
like slathering stuff in sauces because you're  
trying to hide something right yeah oh wow it's 
really good nothing to hide here this is delicious  
a little more rice here this is really 
really vinegary but i love it it's good  
the smell it tastes way better than it smells 
but the the vinegariness of it with the meat  
it's fantastic yeah the the acidity of 
it helps break down that meat flavor  
and as always that's great the rice is perfectly 
cooked where you can just grab a little ball  
the sticky rice has become our biggest favorite 
for the trips i think this is so hard because  
every time we do a video i'm like oh no this isn't 
going to be as good as the last thing but this is  
this is probably i can't remember everything 
we've tried but second to the chicken adobo  
which i think might be it's chicken adobo in the 
sinigang soup this is right up there this might be  
better than crispy pie though it's up there it's 
so good and it's just great crispy powder was  
one of my favorites this might be better that's 
right the fact is those small pieces it's so easy  
to eat it's it's amazing exactly i like this 
better than crispy potter i think i might like  
the fact that christopher powder came with like 
the big bone and stuff it's more like a caveman
it's amazing though everything is just you know 
it's hard to ride on this stuff it's so it's so  
good so thank you everyone for recommending this
