Hi good morning everyone this is Maggy again
for Feel At Home channel welcome to my channel
and I hope you will enjoy my topic today because
my topic is about my favorite foods here in
Netherlands enjoy
What is your favorite Filipino food if you
live in other country you are not in the Philippines
what dish is your favorite in your cooking
is it easy to get or to find the ingredients
because when we live in the other country
we miss the Filipino foods I can eat many
foods or dish here in the Netherlands but
still it is the authentic taste of the Filipino
foods that I crave those foods that I eat
since I was a child so I have pictures of
Filipino foods and dishes that I already cooked
here in Netherlands you can view them here
they are 15 including champorado pancit laing
all of them I can cook here in Netherlands
you can view the photos and I will get back
with you after them and I will tell you why
they are my favorite even I am already here
in Netherlands okay okay
So I have this little little listing of the
Filipino foods and dishes that I already cooked
here first is the champorado in the Philippines
this is our favorite since we we’re kids
when there is a typhoon or when we are in
the house our mom cooks champorado this is
always our favorite because it’s so delicious
with the chocolate when my mother can buy
tableya in Visayas tableya is a pure chocolate
blocks that mama use to cook a very delicious
champorado now I’m here in Netherlands I
cook champorado I can buy sticky rice in a
box and I buy pure cacao powder in the supermarket
and I add condensed milk the sweetened milk
it is so delicious I always cook champorado
here until now I always have the champorado
ingredients in the cupboard so that is one
of my most favorite cooking here second is
the cassava cake I don’t know how to make
or bake cassava cake even when I was still
in the Philippines I just learned how to cook
when I am already here then another Filipina
taught me how to bake cassava cake until now
for years now I always bake cassava cake also
one of my favorite when I was in the Philippines
we buy cassava cake per slice in bilao there
is a vendor going house to house to sell it
or in the market here I don’t buy cassava
cake from others because I know how to make
or bake it you can see and view on my cooking
video how to make cassava cake it is simple
if your are not in the Philippines you can
buy grated cassava anywhere you are you can
also make your own cassava cake the third
of my favorite food here in Netherlands is
tuyo this is dry fish these are the smelly
or stinky dry fish my husband don’t like
the smell of it but for me it is not stinky
I love the smell of the dry fish I always
have tuyo but during winter I don’t fry
tuyo here inside the house because he really
don’t like the smell so when he is not here
I fry tuyo most of the time he is not here
so I can cook tuyo tuyo is so delicious when
we have our Philippine holiday I bring back
home tuyo we just wrap them tight with papers
and plastic because of the long flight it
gets smelly in the airplane now the fourth
is balunbalunan this is chicken gizzard some
like gizzard and liver together but I like
more the gizzard adobong balunbalunan uhhh
it is so delicious especially when the sauce
gets sticky and oily and it becomes more delicious
when it is left over after one or two days
you heat them uh it is so delicious I just
match it with tomatoes I really have a good
meal with rice here in Netherlands there is
no gizzard in the supermarket we can buy gizzard
during market day there are stalls that sells
chicken meat by parts but there is also a
store here in centrum I am not sure if it
is a Turkish or Arabic store but they also
sell gizzard every Thursday so I know when
I can go there to have gizzard so I regularly
cook adobong balunbalunan uh what is this
we talks all about foods hahaha one more dish
that I love to cook here is beef nilaga firstly
because beef is cheap here beef is as price
of the chicken and pork so it is easy to cook
beef nilaga here my beef nilaga is with corn
potatoes Baguio beans and sometimes with cabbage
too the way how my mother cook beef nilaga
my niece requested that I vlog beef nilaga
this is I will feature on my forth coming
cooking vlog because I cannot cook them all
once I do just one by one so we have five
now one dish that I also enjoy cooking here
here is Laing super because at home in the
Philippines my mother always cook laing this
is like a trademark of Bicolanos because my
father is from Bicol so my mother learned
how to cook a very delicious laing I can buy
fresh taro leaves here or dry taro leaves
and I mix my laing with pork sometime we can
just mix tuna with our laing it is still delicious
taro leaves is very delicious when cook with
coconut milk one more dish that I love to
eat here in the Netherlands is tahong or mussels
I just simply sautéed mussels we have a holiday
in Geithoorn when we dine out I ordered mussels
what I was expecting it is only a bowl of
mussels but what they gave me is one pot of
mussels it is so many but I finished them
all because it’s my favorite my father our
family mussels is our favorite here in Netherlands
we can buy mussels with shells and also already
cleaned mussels no shell depend on what you
prefer but I buy the clean mussels no shell
sometimes I like to try those with shell and
I like to learn how to clean them next is
upo there is a Filipina here who have me upo
half of the whole upo part it three because
it is so big so I have three times cooking
of that half upo this is one of the very delicious
dish sautéed upo with shrimp the upo that
Leny gave me yes it’s Leny hi Leny the upo

of tomatoes and shrimps uh it’s so delicious

year round one more Filipino food that I love
here is Buko pandan this is a dessert I bought
a pandan gelatin mix I will feature on my
vlog on how to make gelatin pandan flavor
I’m happy that I can also make Buko pandan
here in Netherlands also pakbet I can also
cook pakbet because I can buy bagoong or shrimp
paste here the bagoong here is in the jar
this is not the stinky bagoong the smell is
really delicious because it is cooked and
a little sweet so when you mix it in your
cooking it is delicious and smells really
delicious I can also buy okra string beans

one by one what else one more is monggo or
mong beans there my son is at the back I always
have monggo sometimes with shrimp sometimes
pork and with chicharon so delicious we don’t
have sili leaves here I add spinach with my
monggo because not much kangkong here or sili
leaves so what I use is spinach also delicious
I am also getting use of the life here to
adapt to find solutions when there is some
ingredients that are unavailable I know now
the alternative so I can still enjoy the Filipinos
foods and cooking then here the sisig this
is always in our family menu because my husband
loves it easy recipe because no grill sisig
