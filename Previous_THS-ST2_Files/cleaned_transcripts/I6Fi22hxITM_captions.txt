The first Jollibee in Europe is finally about to open
Right here in Milan
This will be a great achievement
For this company and all the Filipinos living in here will be happy
Because I think that Milan
is home to the largerst filipino community in Europe
That's why they decided to open it here
If I can I'll be here in Piazza Armando Diaz just next to the Duomo
for the open day
Today is a very special day for the filipino community in Milan
Because the first Jollibee in Europe is now open
Right here in Milan
In Piazza Diaz next to the Duomo
 
Look now at the queue
It's 10.30 am
And there's already a huge line-up
It looks like the iphone day one line-up
 
It goes well beyond the entrance of the restaurant

Now you'll ask what's Jollibee?
If you didn't already look at my videos from the Philippines
It's a filipino fast food chain
It's one of the few filipino multinationals
globally renowned and it has both the traditional
fast food dishes like hamburgers
fried chicken
Known here as Chickenjoy
It's the most popular food of this fast food
It also has more exotic dishes
Now I don't know if the Italian Jollibee menu
will be the same as the original one
Or if they will adapt it to fit italian taste
 
But there are also peculiar foods like jollispaghetti
With tomato, ketchup, cheese strips and wurstel
Halo-halo the tradition filipino dessert
the mango dessert and other less orthodox stuff
it's a one-of-a-kind fast food
 
I've been stuck for 3 hours
My italian friend got fed up and left
So many people look, endless queue
 
They said it opened at 8.00 am
 
But some folks had been camping here since 4.00 am
 
It's the 6th hour of queue
and I'm close to the entrance
I don't reckon having waited so long for anything
not even a concert
 
First a filipina attacked a filipino over the position in the queue xD
 
The vibe is now more tense
 
This is a way to test my patience
my zen skills
We're approaching the 7th hour
But I'm inside
Finally!
 
Oh man I didn't thought it was so big inside
There's yet more queue
I thought the counter was just round the corner
We're almost there guys, it's almost 8 hours
 
 
 
What a day
Never done such an experience
But given the epicness of the event
It was worth it
Waiters are all filipino
They have been working since 8.00 am
 
It's really heartwarming
To see al this filipinos
Happy and euphoric for the opening of this Jollibee
Despite
the workload to bear
today was really huge
and for the customer it was an exacerbating wait
 
But
something that I notice in filipinos
a recurring personality trait is that
even through hardship and stress
they always keep a positive attitude and a solid smile
 
 
The queue will go on till the closing at 11.00 pm
There are no available chairs
all booked
Guys, Jollibee
Piazza Diaz next to the Duomo
