Onion skin - Bruised Filipino pride
Filipinos are the nicest and kindest people
in the world, but they tend to have "onion
skin".
Filipino pride
is easily hurt, and the reaction is not always
rational.
And it's really important that you understand
this if
you're in an Australian Filipina relationship,
and that you grasp this aspect of Filipino
culture.
Filipino pride
Filipino people on the whole are not arrogant.
They are generally kind, and they value other
people very
highly.
They welcome guests and they show respect
their elders and they are patient with children.
And
they are mindful of not embarrassing you or
hurting your feelings.
However there is the issue of their
own feelings and their own pride if they feel
embarrassed or ashamed.
And when that happens, logic
tends to go out the window.
It has long been said, mostly by Filipinos
themselves, that Filipinos have "onion skin".
It means a thin
skin which is easily damaged, and yes this
is the nature of the average Filipino.
Thin skinned!
Easily hurt.
People grow up in a society where pakikisama
is the rule of the day.
It implies the need to go along with
others and not to rock the boat.
Part of this is the need to avoid causing
shame and embarrassment
(nakakahiya) in others.
People go to great lengths not to challenge
anyone headlong, especially in
public.
People avoid saying NO.
They avoid confronting each other with harsh
realities.
And I suppose a
lot of it is that if you grow up that way,
ie.
not used to being confronted, then you don't
know how to
deal with it.
You will probably have noticed things like
the dreaded tampo in a girl?
She lets things build up and get
to her, and she responds largely by sulking
and maybe even storming off for several days.
The way this is
handled by others is they don't mention it
when the girl returns, because to do so would
cause
nakakahiya.
Someone disgraces themselves in some way publicly?
People mostly look the other way
and never mention it, because they know they'll
embarrass you.
What happens when a Filipino is embarrassed?
The reaction can be fairly shocking if you're
not accustomed to it.
People whom you thought were level-
headed, calm and sensible will react sometimes
quite badly and irrationally.
Had a close friend years ago.
Couldn't use a computer.
We had just started using Facebook, and I
suggested to our friend (given that she and
Mila were close) that she also get Facebook
so they could
keep in touch.
She assumed I was laughing at her for being
somehow stupid, and never talked to us ever
again.
Explained to her husband, and whilst he knew
I didn't mean anything of the sort there was
nothing he could do.
The embarrassment happened, and the damage
was done.
Had a relative (who worked for us and lived
with us) take something mild I said to him
badly.
Packed up
and left his wife and kids behind here and
didn't return for 5 - 6 months.
And as for staff members, if they do something
wrong and you have to tell them, you know
there's a
good chance they will quit and not come back
almost immediately.
They will do this even if they have
families to support and no other source of
funds.
It's the shame of being personally confronted
that does it.
Filipinos themselves will often get someone
else as a go-between to do it.
If they resign, they'll leave a note somewhere.
Or they'll get their wife to
tell you.
And text messages, of course.
The other one is to simply say nothing.
Let it go.
To smile even if you're annoyed.
To look down....scratch
the back of the head...and not answer.
Or to avoid that person, even for days on
end.
Anything to avoid
a confrontation and the inevitable embarrassment
and loss of hiya (face) that comes from it.
I've
definitely got better at it, but as a blunt
Aussie it doesn't come naturally.
We're taught to straight-
talk.....get it off your chest.....not beat
around the bush...to own-up, and 
to take it on the chin.
Here in
the Philippines?
You may as well be speaking Ancient Greek!
