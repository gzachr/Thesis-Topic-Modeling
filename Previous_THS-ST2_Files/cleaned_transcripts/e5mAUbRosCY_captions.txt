- So we're here for the second week
at the pop-up here in Cebu city.
Make sure and check out the links below.
If you want to come and check
out any of these businesses
I'm here by the Philippines flag
which I found out is inverted,
which apparently means war.
So I'm not going to get too close
to the flag ones standing here.
I hope you guys enjoy checking out some
of the other businesses that are here
and trying out some of
the food through my eyes.
(guitar music playing)
So you can see Paul behind us.
That's true.
Drive-thru service, but
just here on a dirt road
this guy is just pulling up
for his coffee because it's
it's really great coffee.
I'm riding on his truck and
then it'll be off on his way.
Thank you, sir.
Got my coffee.
It's gotta be a bit hot.
So I'm with Curt and Curt is
also a here at the pop-up area
and after getting some
coffee over at Paul's
I needed to stop here
as a second priority because
I saw that he had tacos.
Please tell me more about
what kind of tacos you have.
- These are actually a little bit
of an inventive take on tacos though.
One, it follows the same assembly
as a traditional Mexican taco,
but the main difference is
that I'm actually infusing
Filipino flavors to it.
So let's just say, I start
with a Mexican pulled pork,
which it's similar to barbacoa
but it's pork and then pickled mangoes
which are actually Guadalupe needed
from Cebu and then cucumber salad
that actually goes on top of it.
It's not, it's not the typical way
and it's actually more heavy on the taste
but it's actually more on the balance.
So that's what I'm trying to do
with my tacos, hand the sandwich.
I'm also selling.
- Awesome. I love it.
Make sure I come here.
Check out Curt's tacos.
We're going to have a link
to the pop-up stand below
and I know this is going to be delicious.
All right.
Thank you.
Awesome. Thank you so much.
- Hey, my name is Murphy.
- Murphy, great great to meet you.
So you got one of the
coolest motorcycles here.
Yeah. Tell me what you're selling.
- I'm selling.
This ones are Bree squealer.
Usually you can find
this cuisine in Korea.
So I thought I brought it here.
- Very, very cool.
How long have you been doing this for?
- For a month.
Okay. How's it going?
- That's a good request I have on there.
- Very cool.
- So what gave you the
idea during a pandemic
to just start a new business like this?
- Actually this is for the family.
Yeah. At the same time,
we can do my friends here.
- Very cool.
So my understanding is a lot of the
the group here is all friends together.
- Yeah. It's old friends.
- Very cool.
So it's not often in Philippines
that you see a group of
bikers that are here.
These are really cool guys,
all friends with each other
and supporting each other with
new businesses and good food.
So good to meet ya.
- Okay sir.
- All the best.
One of the things that
I loved is just walking
by your motorcycle and I see you got
like some natural gas and a pan.
What are you making over here?
- I'm making a homemade lumpia mixed
with veggies and I did go to this pork.
- Nice.
- So you can, you can have this
as your toppings in the rice.
It's very delicious.
- Very good.
And how long have you guys been
doing this business for now?
- About four months already.
- Awesome.
- Since pandemic, we
started this business.
So while we meet
different kinds of people,
making some friends,
we, we earn also.
- That's awesome.
Yeah. Great.
To be able to enjoy what
you're doing with work.
- Yes.
- Yeah.
- And it's really unique
because we cook in the motorcycle itself.
- I love that.
So it's really unique.
Like you guys are doing here.
Like I say, a lot of the classic
motorcycles in Philippines
so it's really a lot
of fun just seeing all the
motorcycles here as well, so.
Awesome.
- Thank you.
- Wish you guys a lot of success.
- Thank you, sir.
Thank you so much.
(guitar music playing)
Alright, so good to be here with you guys.
What is your name?
- Carlos Rodriguez.
- Carlo and
- Henry
- Carlo and Henry.
So we have a bit of a team
here working together.
So I understand this is one
of your van, so it's it's
it's your van and then the
artwork is yours Carlo?
- This one here yeah.
- Awesome.
So how long have you guys been together?
Like sharing a van
and sharing some artwork
to do a business together?
- Just maybe a month or two.
- Okay. Okay.
- Almost five months.
- Yeah. Okay.
Sure. Sure.
So living in the van, during the pandemic
and both of you guys, it
sounds like trying to figure
out a way during kind of hard
times to, to make it happen.
- Yes.
- I really respect that.
How long have you been doing art?
- Since around 2002, I
had been traveling around
but during the pandemic
time, all my store shut down.
I had to learn, get the lights online.
Sure. Slowly getting out,
just like now pop up stores.
Yeah
- I understand.
Yeah. Very cool.
Can you maybe show us one
or two of the pieces of
artwork that you have?
- Yeah. So I have necklaces here,
a lot of crystals and stones
and some of my monsters and
some pamphlets and bracelets.
So basically summer beach
wear, but I wear them anywhere
and we also have some stickers
and a few organic stuff.
- [Interviewer] Cool.
- Honey and ginger roots and
cookies stickers as well.
And he's selling dried fish as well.
- All right.
So we got some buwad over there as well.
Is that buwad out that you make
or? Ah, that's from Bantayan Islands.
- Ah, Bantayan Islands.
Okay. Oh nice.
I know a certain secret camera man
that's also from Bantayan Island.
Also a bit of a classic
motorcycle guy as well
but we won't say his name.
I think I might start a new
television show pimp my scooter.
(Lo-fi music playing)
So finally something I think vegetarian
I could get for me here.
I'm going to have to try out some
of these guys food and
let's go talk to them.
(Lo-fi music playing)
So I'm here with Coco and Brad.
They have another one
of the bikes here that is super awesome.
Cooking up some good food with
natural gas on the skillet.
I haven't quite seen
anything like this before
but their food looks great.
So I'm going to have them
cook up some for me as well.
Can you tell me how long have
you guys been doing this for?
- Oh, actually this is
just our second pop up.
We started last Sunday.
We have been been conceptualizing things
because it's been a lot
really so we have to compliment the menu
along with other offers as well.
- Sure.
- Then we came up with the fried noodle.
That's why it compliments
with other products too.
- Smart idea.
It's good to stand out from the crowd.
- Yeah.
- So what made you guys
decide to start this now
during the pandemic?
- Oh, actually it's really more
of the stress that we had
with our job and we really need
to like check something out.
We get the bikes and as long
as like we get to go out,
we love good food as well.
So why not just meet everything halfway.
So that's when we realized
that, why not do something
about food on our bikes,
then this came up that's why.
- [Interviewer] That's very smart.
Great. To be able to work
together as a couple.
And especially with somebody
that you love and seems
like a lot of the people here
are all friends together.
Is that the case for you guys as well?
- [Coco] Yeah. Yeah.
We it's really with everybody.
Everybody on bikes.
We're friends.
It's one family here.
Not just friends, really best friends.
We're siblings in here.
So yeah.
That's how it goes.
- That's awesome.
That's awesome.
Well, I look forward to
checking out your food
and I wish you guys a lot of success.
- Yes. Thank you.
Thank you so much.
Nice meeting you guys
on our second pop up.
This means a lot.
- Awesome.
Thank you so much.
(Lo-fi music playing)
I think I need to get a motorcycle.
I'm sick of the SUV.
Don't tell Grace.
(Lo-fi music playing)
Mmm.
Absolutely awesome noodles
here from Engine Break.
If you're ever in Cebu city,
make sure and check these guys
out in the other businesses that are here.
As always,
Thank you for taking the
time to listen and take care.
