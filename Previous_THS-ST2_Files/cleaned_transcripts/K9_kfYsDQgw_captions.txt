a lot of people in the UK don't even
know what Filipino food is so why do a
Fusion yeah they don't know what the
food is
going to see
[Music]
come with me and visit the Lao by Franco
it's a new hearty Filipino restaurant in
Romford and let's talk to the owner JJ
hi guys I'm here in Romford I am trying
the new Filipino restaurant called dilau
just there and I'm so excited they are
really brand new they open in March this
year and they serve traditional Filipino
food come let's go try their food
[Music]
before
um tell us your full name and what you
do I am JJ Franco and I work and own
fill out what made you open
passion for opening businesses when I
was a kid I was younger my grandparents
owned the hospital in the Philippines
okay so you know as Filipinos you want
they wanted to be a doctor or a nurse or
an engineer but I never really got into
that because I don't know since I was a
kid I used to climb up or a mango people
and I was like six seven years old so at
that time
to follow my parents
a lot of people have been telling me to
open my arm so don't pandemic
I started working back at the hospital
again
my hospitals there is a hospital close
by so that's why that's why there's a
lot of Filipino Singapore Ah that's good
that's why there's a lot of Filipinos
here so since then
um
on my spare time I started doing
catering so I started doing food race
then it went on to I went on to do
events so like birthday parties occasion
I used to do on my own so I cook I go to
the location I set up everything yeah
sometimes I serve as well and after that
I I clean up
drive home then uh wash all of this
myself
sometimes one-man band isn't it white
why the word that means to him or taste
yeah that's why it's still now I thought
it might be because my mom's from later
so I speak a bit of
um but um I wasn't sure just in case if
I know meaning
I've seen a lot of Filipino restaurants
yeah that's good actually yeah I like
that name actually it's very yeah yeah
you know it's Filipino you know exactly
yeah exactly yes how has it been since
you opened it's been good so far it's
been good we've had a lot of I mean
there's a big Filipino community in
Rockford yeah but majority of our
customers are
yeah even outside of London
they just like we had customers from
Birmingham yeah Southampton Wadsworth
yeah Cambridge just came early we're
really happy about it so it's different
phases every day which is really good
yeah what would be the last specialty I
would say uh
um there's actually a lot
um a lot of people love RCC
and are pulutan which is our Esau yeah
Esau the puso the heart yeah so the
interest in the heart and the gizzard
that's whatever the barbecues
it's quite an interesting uh menu
because it's different to a lot of
Filipino
which is great actually yeah I decided
to keep it small because um I mean this
is just a small menu but
yes yes
everything everything we do here is we
do it fresh yeah you know microwave you
know so like what you see here
we just cook it as we order so yeah
that's why sometimes it takes long
orders because we do cook them fresh
yeah Filipino food I find it's an
an early stage because we are still
trying to find our own feet after how
many years of yes
um being colonized so we're only now
trying to find our identities in our
food in our culture and in general as
well that's true but I think we're
moving to the right pace it's still like
the babies yeah baby stage so we're
still trying to find but we're getting
there because there's a lot of them like
Filipino chefs here that are trying
hiring a Filipino food in the UK which
is a good book yeah they they put in the
name of Filipino cuisine in the map yes
it should be there yeah it's like a
Hidden Gem yeah it is a hidden jump for
now for now yeah exactly how important
is Filipino food do you think for the
people or the Filipinos in London the
reason why but uh you can see outside it
says authentically Filipino yeah
I didn't want to do a Fusion because
um a lot of people in the UK don't even
know what Filipino food is so why do a
Fusion yeah they don't know what the
food is so that's why I wanted to keep
it authentic so they at least they taste
what Philippine food is yeah it's good
to have a fusion like I mean like no
offense to the other restaurants I
appreciate that they're really good the
chefs I'm not but for me I think like I
want uh rich people of people in the UK
to say what Filipino food is first yeah
before I mix it with other cuisine we
can do that in the Philippines maybe in
this
champagne we know what Filipino food is
yeah with Japanese Chinese then everyone
will appreciate it yeah but in the UK
where Filipino Cuisine is is not yet on
the rise they don't know what it is yeah
that you need to let
them taste like what Filipino food
actually is yeah authentically before
you use it with other Cuisines that's
why that's why I put the authentic group
in Philippine and there's no like mix
here yeah there's no Fusion in one menu
you know apart from the Amigo Express
which is like there's a katsu but it's
for me it's my Lola used to cook me a
pork chop so I just mixed it it's like
pork chop then I just place it with a
vehicle Express that's why it's gives me
wiggle as fast there's my two favorites
presentations maybe slightly different
yeah
it's there yeah I think that's a great
way of doing it because like you said
you know um Filipino food in the UK
isn't so popular yeah it's all known in
fact so having to teach
um the British people what Filipino food
is what it is yeah then it's a good
start yeah what do you think makes the
how unique or different to the rest of
the restaurant that's in the UK well um
I think it's it's the vibe and like it's
combined all of it like the food yeah
the vibe then it starts here like
you feel as soon as you walk in you feel
like that was the Filipino Hospitality
on vacation in the Philippines right now
here in the wrong food that he knows
everyone so everyone comes
family your family yeah exactly so
that's that's what we want to portray as
well we want to make everyone feel
everyone that comes in here feel like
they're home that's why we created this
menu so that at least like I know where
Miles and Miles thousand miles away from
Philippines but as soon as you step in
the door it's like oh that's why I put
the um
your favorite yeah as soon as you walk
in you see it as well
you already ate it yeah
how did you find the
oh it's been really good I mean
um
I said I could say 90 of our customers
are Filipino yeah which is because it's
Filipino food because um
like I said there's a lot of restaurant
in the west yeah uh people from Montford
or Essex area they have to travel to the
west to get
that's why I open here as well because I
lived in Longfield yeah and there's
there's a huge Filipino community
as well but there's two hospitals here
that's why oh wow so that's a good spot
to have it yes exactly of course so
like I've been given a huge support from
them yeah because uh they don't have to
travel to the west to get good food good
vibes like I said every Saturday we have
a live event here yeah music music live
music
but I have to travel because I used to
travel to West or Central just to get
Filipino food yeah no you don't have to
yeah I don't have to exactly
they come in here the shorts uh
flip-flops
especially I know summer exactly exactly
it's always nice to have the support
yeah it was a long travel but everything
was worth it makes me happy yeah oh yeah
how can people find you or how can
people find pillow
