- Hey, guys.
- Hey, guys.
- It's Madeleine.
- It's Samantha.
- And we're the Caleon twins.
- Welcome back to Squared.
(lively music)

every single Friday.

Today we're gonna be doing
a what we eat in a day.
It's perfect timing
'cause we're on vacation,
we're currently in the
Philippines and we're traveling
to Japan today.
- So we're gonna share
with you guys what we eat.
Now, we don't typically
eat these things everyday
'cause, as she said, we're on vacation.
But we just want to show
you guys what kinds of foods
there are in these types of countries and
hopefully you guys enjoy watching it.
- So, let's get on with the video.
- We have eggs, this is longaniza I think.
I'll insert what longaniza is.
It's sweet pork. Wow, it's so hard
'cause the camera is fogging.
It's sweet pork, it's a
breakfast food here in
the Philippines and
it's really hot, though.
It keeps fogging up.
I'm not... oh this is lechon
which is pig, roasted pig.
And this is the sauce for the lechon.
And this is salted egg with
tomatoes, I think you eat this
with this and the rice as well.
The heat of these is
making the camera fog,
but here is rice as well.
So I made a mistake,
this is actually tocino.
Not longaniza. It's tocino.
But it's a sweet pork.
So tocino it's a sweet pork.
Sorry that the camera
is fogging, it's so hot.
I keep wiping it.
And then, this is lechon
but it's lechon kawali,
so it's been deep fried, not roasted.
I made a mistake with that.
So, this is my breakfast.
- And for our lunch we had airplane food,
'cause we were flying from
the Philippines to Japan.
We had bread, macaroni salad
with veggies and olives,
which I don't like olives
but I still ate them.
And I had rice,
chicken,
and veggies.
- So, we're here at 7-Eleven
and we're thinking of
what to get for dinner.
It's almost 12 so all
the stores are closed,
except 7-Eleven.
And these aisles over here are
super cool 'cause they have
full on meals that you can choose from.
These over here are sandwiches.
And then they also have
noodles and rice dishes,
so, it's so many options.
(lively music)
- We got back from 7-Eleven
and it's really late at night.
I think it's 12 at midnight already.
But, here are the things we bought.
We weren't that hungry because
we had dinner on the plane.
We just got snack food.
So we got:
Teriyaki chicken and egg sandwich.
The sandwiches look pretty
cool here, I don't know,
they've displayed it really pretty.
- So, basically there's soft
boiled egg, egg salad and
teriyaki chicken. I think
this was in there too.
I got hot milk tea and they
have a whole fridge section
of hot drinks, so I'm excited to try that.
- And then, this is milk crepe cake.
A layered crepe cake.
- That's so cool.
- I love.
And then we got onigiri,
which is basically...
What is it?
- It's like a sushi, right?
- It's like a rice ball
with sushi rice and
then inside we got chicken.
And then, we also got...
I'm not even sure what this is.
But I was watching some food
vloggers, who went to Japan
and they tried this...
thing.
I don't know if it was this brand.
I think it's some sort of milk pudding.
By the look of it, there's a milk picture.
We got chopsticks here to eat our food.
Actually we don't even need chopsticks,
I think this is for my mom and dad's meal.
A little spoon and fork 'cause
the cake and the pudding.
So, we're gonna eat.
It has steps on the
back on how to open it.
It's all in Japanese but I do...
It's a number one?
(laughs)
So, it's so cool how they package it.
- Pull it.
- When you open it. It's a
very functional packaging.
- Two.
Two, you go down.
- Yeah, down.
- And three.
- That's so cool.
- Yeah.
- There.
And there is a sandwich.
- The thing about Japanese packaging
is that they separate the
seaweed from the rice,
so it's not soggy, which
I think is so cool.
The packaging preserves
the seaweed and the rice.
So, when you unwrap it,
then, you can put them together.
- That's it for the video.
