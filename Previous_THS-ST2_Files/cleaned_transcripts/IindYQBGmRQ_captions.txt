okay guys we are stranded in siquijor island for 
another day we planned on leaving today so we  
got up we left the hotel about nine o'clock in the 
morning we headed to the port which we read online  
there was a boat leaving that port at 12 40. there 
wasn't a boat leaving that port at 12 40. there  
wasn't a boat leaving that port at all so after 
being told by the tourism board there was a boat  
leaving the other port we headed there instead no 
boat leaving there either so we've managed to get  
tickets for tomorrow morning at 20 past eight so 
we're stuck on the island for another day why look  
for someone today one of the main amenities that 
we look for is wi-fi obviously we needed to upload  
videos we needed to reply to comments we needed 
to pretty much do anything that we're trying to  
achieve so we turn up to our accommodation for the 
night and there's no wi-fi and we've actually we  
actually paid a little bit more than we normally 
would for this hotel consider the pools we thought  
oh we're here for an extra day we might as well 
treat ourselves and please there's no wi-fi so i  
think we're gonna head to the pool we'll show you 
around this place quickly and then we'll show you  
a bit more of the resort i guess but yeah 
not a great start to the day no which is a  
really big shame because the actual resort 
itself well we haven't been to the pool yet  
but our room is really really lovely the aircon is 
awesome but there's just no wi-fi um we wouldn't  
have booked it if we knew no so this is the room 
we've got like a little we've got a little hat  
area we've got a double bed it's a fairly big room 
yeah just a couple of bedside tables we've got  
aircon and it's blasting out cold air which 
is lovely there's a big tv which doesn't work
we've got a fridge a wardrobe and 
then we've got a pretty big shower  
and a bit of a bathroom so if it had wi-fi it'd 
be perfect because we'll be able to get some  
stuff done but it hasn't okay so we've gone down 
to the pool area now and it's actually quite nice  
it's really really nice we have an amazing 
bit which we will show you in just a second  
doesn't quite make up for the lack of wi-fi but 
it's close yeah so this is the view from the pool
right on the sea front and this is actually  
an infinity pool too i think 
you can get down to the beach
but this is the pool area
and there's a bit of a restaurant
so yeah it is really nice and this is where we're 
going to be for the rest of the day probably  
i mean it's not what we planned but we might 
as well make the most of a bad situation and  
just chill out there's also some steps that 
just go straight down onto the beach i think  
the only way you can access this beach is 
from all the resorts just all the way down  
so it's super quiet there's not many people that'd 
be nice to just like chill out today i guess  
we are um leaving the island today we are going 
to head to the port and then take a ferry over  
to bohol hopefully everything goes really 
smoothly because we have had a couple of long  
travel days in the past few days so we can get 
there nice and early and find some accommodation
after about a half hour we have got seat numbers
okay we've arrived in bohol and here's like 
a sneak peek of what we're going to be seeing  
so you can see like lumps in the 
grass and a little animal here  
just some clues of what we'd be 
seeing in the next couple of days  
guys we've arrived in alona beach we took a 
bus ride from the main city where the port  
is all the way down the island are we are 
in the southern most part of pangala island  
yeah which is the island just south of bohol if 
you didn't know that anyway we've arrived here  
it feels very resorty yeah it does relaxing sort 
of vibes we've got four nights here so we're going  
to spend a couple of days exploring bohol yeah 
really excited and a day exploring down here so  
so we're just gonna head to the hotel now check 
in i'm gonna head straight back down to the town  
and just see what we come across yeah definitely 
check out the beach straight away yeah we're  
really really close to the beach too i think we've 
locked out here we've got a apartment to ourselves  
for 10 pound ish at night and this is it want to 
give a bit of a tour this is our living room we  
have two chairs and a tv this is our kitchen we've 
got whole rice cooker cutlery nice big fridge
this is the bedroom
and here's the bathroom a 
private bathroom hot water shower
the only thing is there is a power shortage 
at the moment in bohol so the electricity  
goes on and off every now and again so right now 
we don't have electricity but apparently it comes  
back on in the evening and then we've got a little 
bit of an outdoor area here where in between all  
the apartments we just headed out now we're going 
to check out the town but the current situation  
on bohol it seems as if there's no electric in the 
day and there's no electric in the night they just  
have in the morning and in the evening obviously 
with no electric on the island comes no wi-fi  
meaning we can't get videos up but so if there's a 
gap we apologize but you have already experienced  
that yeah um but we're not gonna let that stop us 
exploring as long as we can get the gopros charged  
the gopro battery's charged every night then we 
should be fine to see we should be fine to carry  
on seeing the island but hopefully it's fine it's 
fine gotta see the good in things so hopefully  
it'll be resolved in the next couple of days and 
all will be well we've made it down to the beach  
and it is absolutely jam-packed 
it is so fun it is easter sunday  
there's a lot of people here um yeah obviously 
this is probably going to be the busiest day  
yeah without a doubt your people all the way 
along all the way down having like picnics and  
yeah big like gatherings barbecues and 
stuff yeah it's nice though music playing
and then all the kids are just in the seats
just sitting on the porch move 
the electric stitching back on
pour some grapes earlier play some cards we've 
booked some flights yeah ashley's phone is on like  
10 so we did manage to bump at least a flight 
of the ball yeah so if we don't have any  
internet or electric or anything until 
then we know we've got to leave that's  
all just a little update before it gets 
pitch black and you can't see us the sun  
is pretty much set this is the sky at the moment 
we are still here chilling still in electric  
the lady said it was gonna come on at full snow 
sex she said three four four yeah six o'clock  
so someone was just gonna be sitting in the dark 
we couldn't sit there any longer in the dark  
so we vented out hoping maybe to find some of the 
bars in the restaurants and things had generators  
so we're hoping maybe we can find a barn 
restaurant to charge your phones okay if  
you can hear all that noise in the background 
that's the big generators that all the restaurants  
like mcdonald's and this place of you jollibee 
they all seem to have and seven eleven they're  
really loud and they're everywhere in like the 
main bit of the town it must be a regular thing
we're down on the beach now and there's actually 
quite a lot of people still here in the dark  
a lot of people still like 
having picnics and stuff  
um these persons seem to have a lack 
of truck on they must be the generator
guys we're coming somewhere challenging our phones
and the food looks really really lovely some 
drinks so i think we can relax a little bit now  
knowing that at least you'll have a fortune charge 
because you've got spaghetti bolognese i got  
spaghetti arabiata and we've 
also got a band playing here  
just for us because there's no one 
else here well they've got electric so  
yeah private by the sound of the generators we 
don't think the electric has probably come back on  
however we have managed to charge our phones to 
100 so hopefully they last through the night and  
then tomorrow morning afternoon maybe we don't 
really know hopefully but we have got enough  
charge on the camera to head out and film all 
day tomorrow so that's good so we're going to  
be renting a bike and exploring bow hall a bit 
tomorrow but for now we are going to end it here i  
want to say if you are new around here please just 
subscribe if you're still here watching the video  
thanks for watching might as well give it a thumbs 
up and we will see you again in the next one
you
