 
Me and my friends will be celebrating today.
This is our yearly tradition.
We will be doing our Secret Santa and exchange gifts and I cooked LUMPIA for them.
I thought I would let them try Lumpia. Let's see what they're reaction would be.
Let's see if they will like it.
It's kind of hard to vlog while walking but
I know this will surely be exciting!
I'm really excited!
I am going to....
I am on my way to my friend Leanne's house.
We will be meeting there with my other friend Sonia.
It's usually just the three of us who meet up during Christmas.
Come and join me guys!
By the way, if you're wondering, the lockdown was lifted.
So we can go out again but
The lockdown was lifted on the 2nd December.
So this is the first time in a long time I was able to travel this far from home.
It's nice but it's COLD!
It's a nice day but is soooo COLD!!!!
My hands hurt!
I hope I still remember where Leanne's house is.
Let me just look for her house.
I think I am at the right place.
Is she here? Am I at the right place?
So they have a Santa here.
Sorry if it's a bit dark.
