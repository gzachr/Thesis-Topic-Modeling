The next stop was Shimizu island,
you let us freely discover the place
while preparing lunch on boat.
That was a nice BBQ lunch, they placed a table
full of grilled pork, fish, fruits.
Um... I don't know what it is but it tastes good
We moved to a snorkeling point, I guess
it was near to the big lagoon.
It's embarrassed to say that I had never
tried snorkeling before.
I can't swim and so afraid of the sea
but this time I decided to try.
Seeing the coral reefs was and his most
favorite of the day she said
They continued the tour by heading to the
Secret Lagoon.
Many passengers already tired
and stayed on boat for a short nap
instead of getting inside by the kayak or swimming.
The last stop worst seven commandos
beach.
The sun was still shining, sky still blue
the water and the beach itself was so clean as always.
We went back on land at around 4:00 p.m.
and this was what I've got after the tour.
We had dinner with our new friends on
the street full of grilled seafood.
That was a good place for dinner
with acceptable price.
Our original plan on 10th of March was riding a motorbike up to the far beaches.
But we were tired and the next day would be an exhausted transfering day for us,
we wanted to save energy.
So we just has some walks and enjoy the landscape.
Three days in El Nido will be my good memory.
Beside the beautiful islands, what I love the most is
the way they protect environment.
people may look dark or untidy but they always keep their living environment clean
and stay away from plastic.
No plastic bag, they refer paper bags.
Even the straw is made of bamboo or paper.
Will I comeback El Nido?
I'd say I'm not sure. Cause
it's not convenient to get there,
I have to take two flights and one van.
Among thousand islands in Philippines, I think I would visit another destination if I come back
to this country but anyway El Nido is
amazing for beach lovers.
That's all for this video.
Thanks for your watching and
see you next time.
