Okay.

Byebye.
All right.
Tara na.
I think that's the word, right?
Tara na.
Ocean park.
Yes, sir.
All right, guys.
We're back on the road.
We're speaking to, uh, my friends at the,
uh, at the reception area, super friendly.
Every time I walk in, they're
like, hey, how are you?
And then, hello, brother, how are you?
Good.
Kamusta ka, I think is the
word for that, kamusta ka.
Um, but.
We are heading out today.
Oh, hello.
How are you?
Good, man.
I love the Philippines.
The Philippines is great.
Everyone's so friendly.
It's amazing.
Um, but as I was saying, we're
heading out today because I have a few
friends, um, that are flying out today.
Actually they've been in the Philippines
for a while now and oh, hello.
How are you?
Is that a uh
an escort or what's the nice way
to say hooker in this country?
I don't know.
Anyways.
Oh man.
Um, I have a few friends that it's
their final day in, uh, the Philippines.
Luckily I arrived last night
so I can catch up with them.
You may know them.
We hung out in Sri Lanka a little bit and
they've been loving their time here.
So, uh, I, I understand why they've
been loving it here and they have
brought me here with them because it is
an amazing country and I'm loving it.
So.
Anyways, let's go meet up with
them and, uh, yeah, we'll bring
you all along for the journey.
Tara na. Just quickly I'll comment on the,
uh, on the mechanics that we have here.
So the one I caught earlier today,
uh, it was like a spaceship.
It was all tin and you kind of like
were sitting down in like a bob
sled kind of thing, but this is a
little bit different, so I'm not
sure actually what these are called.
Um, but they kind of got the
axles that are connected to
the mainframe of the bike here.
It's all kinda like connected.
You're sitting pretty low to the ground
and whatnot, and yeah, it's kind attached.
The motorbike, pulls it along.
And, uh, this is like a common
form transport here in the
Philippines or definitely in Manila.
Um, they're everywhere.
Like literally you, you had to
see them all the way around.
I almost just got my head
clocked off by a car.
That's not what you want, but,
um, yeah, tara na let's do it.
We'll get to, uh, meet my friends.
Limos are back the limo.
Hello?
Hello, that's so cool.
Limo.
Oh, another limo, another limo.
I got to catch them later on.
I'll just go onto one and just
say, take me wherever you're going.
And we'll go there.
That is an incredible day.
Let's do it.
I have 190.
There you go.
- Thank you.
Thank you very much, brother.
Have a great day.
Enjoy.
All right guys.
So.
Apparently they're staying at hotel H2o,
but how on earth do you get in there?
Um, so we're gonna have to walk
around and see what's going on.
How are they doing?
Everyone's uh, are they army military
people? You never want to film
when there's army people around,
how do they get, how do I get in?
Look at this guy he's selling, he's
selling fruit on the side of the road.
Hello brother.
Ah, what do you have?
Yeah, pineapple, watermelon.
What is this?
What is that?
I will have, um, I'll get
some pineapple please.
Pineapple.
Let's see how he does it.
So he grabs it.
How much?
Peso?
30 peso.
All right, so he cuts
out the middle there.
Chops it all up.
You can put on stick is okay.
Oh, so that's it.
We're done.
Okay, maybe I'll also get some, uh,
watermelon please, seems pretty cool.
So he chops it off like that.
This is 30 peso as well?
All right.
Very good.
Oh, he's chopping it through the bag.
Very good.
Very good.
Oh, I forgot about this.
I don't, I only have,
uh, 1000 pesos change.
Oh well it looks like he's gonna get a tip.
Okay thank you very much, brother.
Unfortunately, I don't have any change
that I do have, do you have change?
Is it okay?
No change.
Okay.
You keep, that's fine for you.
Thank you.
Have a good day.
Okay.
Hopefully it's the best,
best pineapple I've ever had.
All right.

bucks for this basically.
but it's a hot day here in Manila.
So we're gonna have to try it out.
We got some construction going on.

Amazing story.
Huh?
Oh, construction.

Trod into it.
All right.
Let's try this pineapple.
Oh my God.
Best pineapple I've ever had.
I wish I didn't give it away.
That is so sweet.
Man that was definitely worth the 20
bucks I paid for that is -

watermelon in and we'll give it away.
We'll quickly try, honestly, though,

It was so, uh, sweet.
So refreshing on a hot
day here in Manila, here.
Yeah.
How do you say, how do you say delicious?
Sweet.

Okay.
Yeah, bye-bye enjoy your day.
Thank you.
See you.
Oh my God.
Look, it's 3 tarzan horses.
Oh man, guys, this is what I love about
the Philippines is you just walk out.
People are energetic.
People are friendly, man.
That is, uh, incredible.
I really need to start, uh,
walking around with small notes though.
I can't be paying $20 for a bit of pineapple.
You know, but we are gonna be
meeting our friends quickly.
Let's do it.
All right guys.
So I found the entrance, uh, it was
like a hundred meters up from where
those, uh, construction workers were
that we were eating pineapples with.
But here it is.
So this is a hotel H2o, I know Ali and,
his friend is staying here, but it's also
like connected to like a Marine park.
So like in a, an aquarium.
So I think they were like filming
a video here or something.
I'm just here to, uh, link up with them
and then we'll head out for the day.
But yeah, this is like what it is.
You got the hotel there and then you got.
Where you buy tickets and stuff,
and then like tickets for the
aquarium on the right side.
And then the hotel
entrance is on the left.
So maybe we'll come back here.
620 for a ticket.
You get all kinds of, uh,
different tickets and whatnot.
How are you brother?
You good?
Yeah nice to meet you.
Oh, look at this guy.
He's got a cart and he is just
like roaming around the streets.
I need like a hat or something.
I've had this hat for a while.
Hey brother, how are you?
Good, fine.
What do you have for sale?
We, you got, uh,
different kinds of things.
We got gloves.
There's no four finger
gloves for my blown up hand.
Um, but what can we buy?
I need, let's have a
peek around on this side.
See what there is.
Look at this.
You got mirrors and whatnot.
Tricycle.
Hey, from, uh, for tricycle.
Oh yeah we got like the stuff for
the motorbikes and whatnot.
I don't know what these are.
What is this for?
My dinner.
Oh, a mask.
All right.
Let's have a peek at these.
See what?
We've got all kinds of ones.
Wow.
This is such like a, just a
random miscellaneous store.
Yeah, I will, um, have a look.
Oh, look, Gucci.
Look at this.
I'll try it on the Gucci one.
Let's try this one.
You wear
it like this is, uh, like at
the back, ah, up, up on the ears.
Oh, I think this is to like stop the
sun hidden the back of your neck.
And then it's also used as like a face
mask, you know, they're very strict
on, uh, masks here in the Philippines.
So let's uh, oh, look at this Gucci.
How much brother?
50.
Oh, again, I don't have any change.
We'll see.
Oh, you have arm sleeves.
Oh, do you have Gucci?
Gucci?
You have?
Red, green, green, green only.
Oh yeah.
Green.
I try the green one on. What
is it for sun protection?
Yes sir.
Good?
Look.
You have extra large size.
Here we go.
These are cool.
I've never seen this in like any country
that's on the side of the street.
You got, uh, all these, like things that
cover up, keep you safe from the sun.
It is hot.
I'm sweating so much,
but good looking good.
Oh, I got at, I got it on the wrong way.
All right.
Let's put on the Gucci one as well.
Oh, yeah.
Ah, you can do this as well.
Ah, like that.
This is so it's such
like, oh, I look sick.
I'm looking at myself in the mirror.
There's a Starbucks here.
I'm looking at the people.
Using the reflection of
the glass as a mirror.
And they're like, what
are you doing, Luke?
Why are you looking at me?
This is actually sick.
So how much are these?
- 50, 50 sir.
You can do a discount for me?
You can do lower price?
40.
Oh, maybe like 20?
No, no.
Um, but like you can do 40?
40 for two, or 40 each?
Oh, okay.
Oh, again, I don't have change.
Do you have change?
- No more sir.
No change.
Here we'll see.
Oh, that's okay.
Here you have.
It's okay for you.
Take it.
Yeah, that's fine.
Yeah.
Thank you.
Thank you so much.
Have a great day.
All right.
I really need to get change.
Because I'm spending literally 20 USD
on every single thing I buy now.
It's crazy.
We're fully kitted out.
We got the, uh, the bandana.
I got some, uh, um, arm
sleeves, which is super cool.
They'll keep us protected from the sun.
But as I was saying before, you met
up with Ali machan.
The good old Sri Lanka days eh?
Oh man.
We had a fun time there.
Yeah.
And then, uh, to the right, we have
Danny got a world to see, actually
have been watching his videos since,
before I was a blogger, like one, when
I was like 17, 18 I'd finish high
school and would be like, oh, alright,
I need to get myself a travel fix.
So, uh, hey.
Yeah, but you guys have been in the
Philippines for, like over a month.
Almost a month.
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah tonight's gonna be a month,
but you're flying out today.
Yep.
Damn.
Well, what's the, uh, number one place
you've visited in the Philippines so far.
That's what everybody, uh, says. El Nido
is like one of the most famous places.
Hopefully we'll be able
to make it out there.
Um, sometime during this trip, but
we're gonna explore the rest of the day.
See what comes around.
It's a beautiful day here in Manila.
Blue skies a little bit hot, but
nonetheless, it's a great time out here.
All right guys, we are in SM Moa,
the biggest mall in all of Asia.
We got Ali machan, what's the machan word
here in our Philippines?
- Kuya.
Um, but we're just roaming around doing a
bit of shopping, running a bit of errands.
And I think shortly we'll head over to
Jollibee and eat Jollibee for the very
first time heard amazing things like that.
Uh, about Jollibee and I am damn hungry,
so I know it's gonna be absolutely
amazing, but it is the mall, the all
like, you know, back on the other
side, we saw, you know, the classic
designer, um, places, H&M whatnot,
uh, all the major global brands, because
it is the biggest mall in all of Asia.
So all the brands are trying to get a, a
spot in here, get a bit of real estate.
Um, it's really nice.
Just all these cool little
oh cold stone Creamery.
Look at this supercreamy.
All these beautiful, um, shops and whatnot
Adidas, Nike, Fila and whatnot.
But we're gonna roam
around for a little bit.
Oh, even a burger king.
How good.
Um, but yeah, we'll head over
to Jollibee in a minute.
After we do a bit of shopping, look at
this guys, the cinema, and they have
literally, what are these things called?
I literally forgot.
Star wars, right?
They're full like kitted out.
Oh stormtroopers.
That's right.
What's up machan? No, he's not
a machan we're not in Sri Lanka.
This is sick.
Anyways, got to catch up with, oh,
you're there
- There's a Hulk as well.
There's a Hulk?
- Yeah yeah
Where?
Oh, wow.
This is so cool.
I love the cinema
Dude that is so big.
And we got Hulk over here.
Oh my God.
You know what it reminds me of?
He reminds me of Ali machan look, he's
even got the bicep veins as well.
Look at that.
What's up my man?
Damn.
That was big. Jollibee, everybody.
Good afternoon, Mrs.
Jollibee.
All right.
Hello?
Wow.
It is so busy.
That's how you know that the food is good.
And if I've heard what I've heard
from people here in the Philippines,
Jollibee is a religion here.
They absolutely love it.
So we're gonna taste, uh,
a couple of items today.
Or the people lining up
you've eaten here before.
Oh, you said the jolly spaghetti is
the best thing on the menu, right?
No, I've heard good things about the
jolly spaghetti's we've got burgers.
It's basically like the McDonald's
here in the Philippines.
So we're gonna try a few things out.
Definitely try the spaghetti, which
I've heard, uh, is one of the most
like iconic dishes and you can see some
spaghetti beans served up over there.
So.
All right well, let's line up let's order.
And, um, we'll give it a taste.
So we can see all the
food being prepared here.
These ones are serving those customers.
So you order here.
I love the outfits.
Red all got the same
cap on, got the aprons.
Ah, oh man.
I'm so hungry.
I'm so excited.
So excited to eat.
I reckon we're going go
for the cheesy yum burger.
We'll get that in a meal.
And of course on the side,
we'll get some jolly spaghetti.
The jolly spaghetti
looks, God damn amazing.
And you can even get
burger steak, you can get apple
pies, chicken on the side.
Crispy chicken.
Will you have some chicken?
If I order it?
Of course, man.
That's the dumbest question
I've ever asked in my life
and in that chicken I'll take.
Yeah yeah.
All right.
Well, there's so many
options to choose from.
I reckon we're just gonna have to, uh, ask
what's best and see what they provide us.
But look at all the food here.
That's the spaghetti there.
It smells.
So good.
Hello?
Sorry?
Yeah can I please have a, um, a cheesy
yum burger please?
Uh, we have here, uh, dining
also the jolly spaghetti, please.
Cheesy yum burger?
Yes.
How many sir?
Just one.
What's the drink, sir?
Uh, just Coca-Cola thanks.
Any additional, sir?
Sorry?
No thank you.
And I'll also get the, uh,
there's jolly spaghetti, please.
Solo order, sir?
Sorry?
Solo order or with drinks?
Uh solo.
Yeah yeah.
So I'm understanding the process here.
Um, and I'll then also just,
uh, one piece of chicken, uh,
wings thing.
- Spicy or original?
Yeah, we'll go spicy.
Uh Coca Cola.
Kindly double check.
Ah that's all thank you.
Thank you very much.
- Do you have 500 sir?
Oh actually I have, there.
Here's what we got guys.
The cheesy hamburger, the chicken joy, um, with
some other stuff in the spaghetti.
So 277 pesos around.
Uh, thank you so much.
Thank you.
What did you order?
Just a little cheeky, chicken
cheeky, bit of chicken.
I like, I like the sound of it.
So 277 pesos that's around, uh,
like $5.50 us or thereabouts.
So pretty good.
I got a fair bit of stuff for the cheese burger.
The spaghetti, some
chicken, some other stuff.
Uh, so that's actually
pretty good value for money.
All look guys, 22008 now, serving.
Where am I?
Is this for me?
Thank you very much.
All right, we got all the food.
Oh we got more burgers.
Thank you.
Man.
I got a lot of food.
I didn't remember ordering.
Thank you.
I forgot my fork, but here
we have it guys Jollibee.
So here's what I ordered.
We got the cheeseburger, yum burger.
We got the, uh, the Jollibee
spaghetti, which, uh, Ooh.
Oh, that smells pretty good, fries.
We got spicy chicken and I believe
that's rice on the side there.
So that explains why I thought
we had two burgers, but that's
rice in the middle there.
So let's open this up and
we'll get right into it.
I think we'll go cheeseburger,
we'll taste the fries.
We'll leave the, uh, the chicken
in of course we'll leave the famous
spaghetti down for the last of it.
So I am damn and hungry.
So I know this is gonna be a good meal.
Let's do it.
I'm super thirsty.
So let's give the, uh, Coke
or Pepsi, whatever it is.
All right.
We got to get a subscriber quickly.
Like, and subscribe as always.
That is me there.
Like and subscribe.
Thank you.
Let's get the, uh, the
Jollibee video underway
everybody I've been waiting years to say
this, but finally, we're having Jollibee.
We got the yumburger the cheesy
yumburger in the middle of patty
cheese, special sauce on top.
And let's give the big old bite.
That is good.
Yeah we get photo together.
We got some beautiful women.
Doesn't get any better than
that, but this burger is good.
Kind of your typical, like fast food
burger, you got soft sugary bun.
You got the secret sauce in the middle.
Patty.
And a course, some cheese.
So that's a, you it's good.
It's kinda what you'd expect
from a fast food joint.
Like this, it gets the job done.
Let's try
some chippies here.
A big mouthful of this.
Very good
Chips, little bit cold.
But when you're serving this
many customers, you know, you
gotta have an excess fries.
On the side, ready to go. You don't 
want to be waiting 10mins for a fries.
Perfect way,
to combat the Manila sun
here in the Philippines.
Now I opted for the spicy version of this.
We're gonna see in about five
seconds, whether that was a regret
or if that was a smart move,
but let's try the chicken here.
At Jollibee, get a big old fatty bite.
I wonder if there's bone in there.
I wonder if it's a wing or yeah,
there's definitely bone in middle.
So let's get a big bite.
Not spicy yet.
It could be a slow burner though.
It's super juicy.
Super soft chicken, the outside,
super crispy, as you can see,
it's kind of like crumbling off.
It's squirting everywhere as well.
Bloody hell.
It's not as spicy as I was expecting.
You know, I'm used to saying like in
places like India or Pakistan or Sri Lanka,
when they say spicy, they mean like your
mouth is literally in a lava pit.
So this is actually manageable.
So it's good that the Philippines,
you know, the spicy levels are manageable
for a foreigner like me, but.
That's good.
Let's get on the last
part of the review here.
We got the spaghetti
little bits of spaghetti.
I think we got tomato sauce in there.
Let's mix it all up.
Ali was saying before it said
that it was kind of sweet, right?
It's sweet.
Well, let's see.
Oh, I love spaghetti.
So this is gonna be
really good review here.
Interesting
smell, kind of smells a bit spicy.
The sauce is super sweet.
It's like a, even a sausage in the middle.
Oh, that's I actually really like, the,
um, the sugary kind of sauce on it.
It's just like a little
kid's meal, you know.
I'm a fan of that.
Honestly, if I'm to rank them, I'd
go the chicken wings really good.
It's not spicy at all.
Burger's good as well.
And all spaghetti's really good as well.
Fries, least favorite, because they're cold,
but the chicken wing really nice chicken
and uh, the spaghetti, the pleasant
surprise, you know, A spaghetti, you think
of something more like savory, whereas
this is actually like a sweet, um, a sweet
for the sauce in the spaghetti, which
gives a whole different kind of flavor.
All right we finished off the chicken, we
slammed one of the Cokes to it's
really cool how they just have
like their logo and everything.
Um, like I'm not actually sure
whether it's Coca-Cola or Pepsi or
what it is, but it tastes damn good.
Um, French fries slowly
getting through, they're a bit cold, so
not the biggest fan of them.
And, uh, we're finishing up
with the spaghetti, but I
did realize just then, though
I forgot to eat whatever was in here.
So the chicken comes
with like rice, right?
I don't know if it's like sweet
rice or like what it is, but just
a big block of rice right there.
I think we got like some kind of
sauce or gravy there, but I'll
just try this, like plain rice.
I'll get a bit of a
seasoning or the sauce from,
the spaghetti.
If I get more sauce on that,
maybe we'll mix it all together.
Get some spaghetti,
Twirl on the fork like that.
Get a bit of this.
Boom, we got the, the rice
spaghetti Jollibee mix
or not, not anymore, but
I like it with the sauce.
Let's add more, more spaghetti to my rice.
Now I just absolutely destroyed this sink.
It's okay.
I approve.
You know, I feel like obviously McDonald's
is here in the other Philippines as
well, but most people opt for Jollibee.
I remember being in Dubai,
obviously as a massive like Filipino
population working over there.
Um, so I've seen Jollibee
so many times around the world.
And, um, it's good to finally now
say that I've eaten our Jollibee
and it's been a pleasant experience.
I approve.
If you get everything you get
spaghetti, you get French fries, you
get the sauce and you get the rice.
That's what I had.
And you eat it all at once.
Oh that's actually good.
That's good.
The French fries give a unique, um,
when they're on the plate and not on my
lap, they give a unique texture to it.
Oh, my God.
It, it is difficult to eat though.
That's the triple
carbohydrate special, huh?
Exactly.
That's when you're trying
to put on muscle mass.
Oh.
I approve.
all right.
Well, that was Jollibee
complete.
And I think I found, uh, one of my new
favorite, fast food chains in the world.
So definitely I can
guarantee I'll be back here.
Uh, over the next couple weeks, I'm
traveling around the Philippines, but
look, look how cute that mannequin is.
It's just like it's way.
It looks way more better
than, uh, Ronald McDonald.
Ronald McDonald's low key creepy, but
this one, you just want to go hug it.
It's just like the most incredible,
uh, feature and figurine out there.
I've seen so many videos of these.
Here in the Philippines, they
have like all these ice, um, you
know, ice creams and, and whatnot.
So this looks like the coolest thing ever.
Hey brother, how are you?
Um, you only have one type
or, oh, it's up there?
Hawaiian shaved ice.
Which one is the best one?
The rainbow.
Yeah that one looks good.
You have different sizes or only
only small.
And it, it, you shave it here?
Yes.
So I can see everything.
All right.
Hey brother.
Hey, how are you?
You doing good?
Yeah, I'm good.
I want one of your famous
rainbow shaved ice, please.
With the snow cup.
Yes.
With everything.
I want everything.
I want it to make look,
make it look beautiful.
How much is it?
65.
65.
That's good.
We got 70.
There you go you can keep the change.
Oh.
Oh, what is this one?
You have this one as well.
Yes, similar to ice cream,
similar to ice cream.
That's cool.
Flavored ice.
Okay well, yeah, I'll just have the,
uh, the rainbow one, please.
All right let's see how these are made.
So it goes in the back, the ice cream.
Yeah we have ice cream.
Very good ice cream, uh,
ice cream in the middle?
Yeah.
Okay.
All right so that's that done?
And then he goes around to the other side.
I think he's gonna.
Oh, here's all the, oh, oh.
Oh, that looks so cool.
Lock it in.
And then that blade
probably gets it all off.
Oh, that's awesome.
It's like snow.
Snowing.
What's your name?
Sorry?
Yes.
Very good.
Oh, there's so much.
I did not expect this.
Look at that.
It's like a whole snow mountain on top.
How long have you been
working here for? 11 years?
- 11.
Yes.
Wow so you are the.
The ice expert, expert in ice.
All right so he is kind of patted it
down a little bit made into
like the perfect little ball.
So these are all the flavors.
Yes.
So we got what?
Watermelon watermelon, blueberry.
Blueberry.
And banana.
So now it is a rainbow.
Yes.
Oh, we have sweet milk.
Sweet milk.
Yes.
Oh, nice.
And that's us done.
Amazing.
No, thank you very much.
I'll give it a review.
Yeah.
All right, let's go back to the boys.
How cool does this look?
The rainbow iced.
We got like sweet milk in the middle.
We got flavored ice.
I think this one was blueberry.
Um, but let's just try it all.
Let's get bit of purple.
Bit of yellow, bit of red.
If we can put super hard.
All right, here we go.
Wow.
I think, yeah, the sweet milk.
I don't know if you've ever had these
guys at home, be in Australia, we
have these like little lollies that
eat bananas and they're like yellow.
They taste exactly like the, uh, the
sweet milk that he just put on top of it.
Wow.
It makes sense.
Because the yellow one, he said
was banana flavor as well.
That is good.
It's only, it was just
over, it was 65 pesos.
So like a dollar, a dollar
20. At the bottom,
we got ice cream as well.
So once you get through all the
flavored ice and whatnot, you
get your, uh, different flavors.
You get blueberry.
Nice.
You get, uh, watermelon.
Um, it's down in the very bottom,
you can see, starting to get through
to the actual ice cream as well.
Oh man.
You know, Manila has, it's a
bloody hot day today.
The boys were saying that it's one of
the hottest days that they've had here.
Um, it's nothing compared to other
places in like the middle east and
stuff, but for it's pretty hot.
So this is the perfect.
Snack that you can have to
combat the heat here in Manila.
And there we go.
Bit of vanilla ice cream.
10 outta 10.
That is delicious. Oh oh, oh yeah.
All right you can see now that we're getting
through all the ice spit, how creamy the
bottom is, because you put that big bit of
vanilla, uh, ice cream on, on the bottom.
You get through the ice and then
you kind of have it all blending in.
It's just like such a unique flavor
of like vanilla creaminess, icy
flavors of banana, blueberry,
watermelon, and whatnot.
But, mmhm.
Oh look the second best
fast food joint in all the
Philippines behind Jollibee.
All right, we're coming down
to last little bit here.
Look at that big bit ice cream.
Oh, brain freeze.
That was a big bit, but oh, it's
all like turning into liquid now.
So after you have the, um, the, the
solid state that the ice was in it's now.
A little smoothie.
Oh, god again.
Another - 
Another fatty old brain
freeze coming right off.
All right last little gulp here.
Here we are, little bit left.
All right.
Video done, thanks for watching.
Oh my God.
