Hello, this is Grace!!  One of the few yet legit licenses I earned in Japan was this FORKLIFT operation.
A colleague,  had patiently taught me how to operate in the production.   I was so scared and nervous.
This is actually my first try.
After a few months,  I became confident and was able to carry on heavy as 1 ton of rice using this machine.
Operating heavy equipment looks so cool to me... if I were a man,  I am sure I would be getting into that kind of work.   I'm sure... :-)
Why am I uploading this?  I do because I want to let my grandson see this... he actually loves watching this video now.  Later when he is grown-up completely, I want him see how much his grandma tried to do everything in life...
I am sure he would love his grandma more... :-)
By the way,  I loved and missed my colleagues here... they were so nice to me!!   I miss you, Guys!!
See you then!!!
