hi everyone my name is kim and i am a
filipina living here
in slovakia and today i am going to
share with you
one of the slovak tradition that i have
learned
recently called zabiyachka javiyatska
zabiyetzka in english is literally
slaughtering
and i think now here in the big cities
especially bratislava it's not very
common but i know
that in some small villages in slovakia
they're still doing this and
they kind of take care pig feed them
with good stuff and then
then they slaughter it normally there
are two seasons here in slovakia where
they do the zabiyat
it's on november in preparation of the
christmas
season and on march during
easter holiday on april nope
in this video i'm not gonna do
zabiyachka myself
but i'm gonna try all the food at least
some of the food
that they prepared during this activity
i went to my favorite shop here in
bratislava of course you know it it's
called dma
and also the farmers market across the
street were in i found
this two shops called village house
village farm and farm house where they
are
selling this stuff first i have the
smoke
products from zabiatska and we have um
bacon salami
salama and sausages which is klobasa
and i'm gonna have also this one
hospinina
jos penina ogs oxvarka
oscar
all right now here we are in my most
favorite part of the video
tasting and i'm gonna start with this
one it's called
and it is basically pork fat
cooked in its own
um so i was told that i should eat this
with a bread but i will try first
it's good
actually it reminds me so much of
one filipino dish that we have actually
it's not
a dish because we usually have it like a
snacks
and we call it chicharron it's
definitely the same because because it's
also made of
pork fat and then we cook it also in the
with it
with the oil like this deep frying it
but i don't think that i will
prefer to eat it with a bread because i
can just eat it like snacks you know
when you're watching movie
and then you eat this
and then you get fat so now we are on to
the cold cuts
i have been bugging my husband to cook
this for me because it's kind of weird
to cook it
to eat it without cooking but since
there
are preserved i was told that it's okay
to eat them like this
so we're gonna try it i'm gonna uh start
with this lanina
and i think it's very similar to what
we are putting in haloshki is it right
put it with ortiza or
pizza yeah so just like this
i wonder how what it tastes like
i thought that it's gonna be salty
because some of the bacon that i tried
before are salty but this one that we
bought in the farmer's house
you know village farm i think
is so good and you can really
feel the smoky um flavor
of this ladina it's good all right so
next
another product from zabiatska is this
salami so i'm just gonna put it on my
bread like this
and just add a little bit of her pizza
on top actually i want to put it like
this
and let's try this
this salami is so nice
i just really love putting hot pizza in
all of my
cold cuts like this very good
i remember the first time i tried salami
here in slovakia
my mother-in-law gave it to me and it
was so
amazing but i don't think that it's from
slovakia i think it's
from hungary they said but this one is
so nice as well
good viborne
all right so the next one that i'm gonna
try is klobasca
clubasca in slovakia is their sausage
i'm just gonna cut thin slices of it
let's put horchita
i love this for pizza it's the only
mastery that i really love
oh my god i think i can eat it with the
rice not just bread
okay guys the next one that i'm going to
try is
called clatchi
and um i'm very nervous
to try this because it's very
weird looking with all the stuff here
um clutchenka basically came from the
word
clutchit i believe which is called
pressed
in english because basically this is
meat pressed together
so let's try this
i feel like i don't wanna eat it okay
i think just because i have a lot of
prejudices
with this food because i read some stuff
about it before and how they make it
what do they put here because
the thing about zabiashka is that
they use all the parts of the pig
when they kill them and in this
clutchenka um i think how they make it
is it's half part of it is made of meat
and how part of it is the other parts of
the
pig which are like the kidney the heart
the ears
the stomach i don't know what else
the head of the pig maybe and um
so it's kind of weird for me to eat it
but i
it doesn't taste so bad maybe i just
have a lot of
um thoughts about it that is nice
oh god but it wasn't so bad
okay so the next one that i'm going to
try it
it's this dish called huspenina
and again just like that lachenka it's
jelly-like as well look at this guys
it's like gelatine and um
it's pulled pork i think
inside i'm not sure but how they
do this is um they bowled they boiled
this meat or
bones or the knee part of the pig and
then it releases this collagen
and that's why it is looking like this
jelly
i don't know guys i'm getting nervous to
try this but
let's do it let's get the small part
and why everything you eat with the
bread
i can i eat it with the rice as well no
yeah okay then put some sibola
and of course vinegar what is it with
the vinegar is it good combination with
this one
oh yay let's try this
this one is better than touching
when you look at it it's very weird
but when you try it it's really good
i like it they said that it's very
healthy because it's full of collagen
and collagen makes you young
they say all right
so the last that i'm gonna try and the
most anticipated part
of this video are these three sausages
um that we baked i don't know for how
long but this one
is clubasca again but it was fresh
it's not um dried out and this
is called no no
no no it's called and this
is
nicka come on
and in english it's the blood sausage
because the main ingredient of this one
is blood from the pig and for the
i believe pork liver kidney
other organs and it's with rice so
let's try this
i think it is best eaten with the rice
where is my rice
did we make rice yeah
okay let's try first the furuka try it
with the horchita
hmm the texture is very interesting
because it's kind of sticky
it's sticky and savory i like it a lot
i don't taste the rice there
i don't know how they do it
and the outside is a bit
a little bit crunchy which is i really
like
and i think everything that i dip in hot
seat
becomes a lot better i don't know why
but this one is good i like korka
okay let's try
cla baska
clubasco is nice what global makes a lot
different from this
from hurkha is that this this have a lot
of paprika
that's why i use it a lot and i love
paprika
i love this kobaska let's try it with
her pizza
it tastes so good too oh my gosh
let's try this blood sausage
it's kind of weird looking
it's too dark let's try it
smell
mmm that's a really interesting taste
i taste the blood there in the
philippines we also have a dish which we
call dinuguan
from the word dugo which is blood as
well but we don't make sausage in it
from it's like a soup
with a blood let's try it with your
pizza if it will be good as well
i'm right everything you dip in her
cheeks becomes a lot better
i like zaviachka so
that's it for this video guys i hope
that i made you hungry
and just to tell you just to share with
you my most favorite would be the
vasquez but
i like better the dried one the one that
is not cooked
i think it's a lot tastier and smoky
flavor
is a lot a lot better in the philippines
i wanted to share with you guys as well
that we have uh
same thing as zabiyat where in the
family gathers around and slaughter
a pig but not during um
christmas season or easter usually we
have it during reunion
i remember when i was a kid we would
have we will have this
big family reunion that all the
relatives would come
and we will also slaughter a bee and
i remember the sound of the
cry but then again
it was part of my childhood although we
don't make these cold cuts we don't make
sausages we just cook everything with
sauce
um with this filipino dishes and we eat
all of them
it's nice so what about you guys what do
you think about this food are you gonna
try it if you're a foreigner
