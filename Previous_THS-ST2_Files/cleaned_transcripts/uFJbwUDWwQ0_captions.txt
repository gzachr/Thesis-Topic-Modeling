welcome back to Makati I am still in Makati but 
today we are actually going to check out another  
area which is called BGC here I heard it's a very 
modern neighborhood here and yeah I want to take  
the ferry to get there and I have to cross this 
bridge and first I thought it's not going to be  
safe to walk over the bridge by foot but then 
I saw all the locals here doing it as well so  
I just followed them and it seems to be all right 
the bridge is not too much doesn't have too much  
traffic here and then we take a ferry over there 
so we have the river here and wow there's so much  
green stuff on the water that's interesting right 
I'm wondering where all of this is coming from  
oh no I wanted to go to the ferry I'm looking 
for the ferry station it's over there right and  
then I can take the ferry in this direction yeah 
to a guada Guadalupe yeah over there you ride  
up the ferry boat right yeah I want to take 
the ferry yeah yeah okay Ken okay thank you  
huh I'm from Germany Germany Germany yes 
Philippines you're from Manila you're from  
McCarthy ah nice to meet you yes I make a video 
about about the Philippines oh no I don't play  
basketball but many people ask me here I am 
one meter 94. but I don't play basketball I  
have 190. I think in an inch is six two or 
so not sure okay have a good day nice to  
meet you okay bye-bye bye-bye so let's set I can 
indeed take the ferry here which is a great news
ah check it out we have some skyscrapers here 
yeah this is uh the Makati area which I showed  
you already in some of the previous videos 
where I stayed for a few days now already  
and oh we have a boat there maybe this is a 
ferry already that will be cool actually a  
small little boat like this riding along the 
canals here all right is this a Chevy station
hello I want to go to Guadalupe Guadalupe it's  
this boat here this direction okay how much I 
pay here five pesos five pesos okay okay so much
hello
thank you very much
all right that was uh easy now and uh good 
luck with the timing no waiting time for me  
how long is the ferry ride
can we go there
are just over there yeah not over there
how do I go there uh yo that's not forgive me
okay oh this is definitely comes up and down
what I wanted to I actually wanted to wear 
the next station is somewhere over there  
and then from there we can go to the 
beaches here we are but okay let's see
because I think the shot is very right of my life
okay
okay thank you very much oh he has 
an interesting steering wheel here  
oh that looks very nice very 
interesting okay thank you
okay so now I just crossed 
from one side to the other  
this is actually the site where I'm 
coming from because you remember at the  
beginning I crossed the bridge over there 
so actually I didn't make it that far now
but I would like to take the ferry is there 
a ferry going there no not anymore because  
if you go to uh Guadalupe we go to Perry 
right yeah but if you go back to uh yeah
so there's no Ferry going there ah 
okay Uber yes I make YouTube videos  
it's 10 abroad Ken k-e-n and then you can search 
chem Philippines I think by these keywords you  
will find me um okay he just offered to 
uh to basically show me how to go there
so how can I go there jeepney okay
okay I'm just going with the blue now  
can we plan tailed a little bit but I'm not 
in a rush today so let's just go with the flow  
follow these nice gentlemen's here what is 
your name Jason yeah okay what's your name
and I am 10 10. I'm coming at Germany wow and 
I make YouTube videos about uh Philippines oh  
that's great yeah yeah oh very fast for 
the scooter here actually I want to go  
to a BGC BBC yeah yeah but I thought 
I can go through pottery and tobacco  
or something ah by the way where 
is hallucination PGC BTC yeah yeah
um
BGC so we go to Guadalupe first yeah 
and then we change and then foreign
okay so I think we're going to 
take another Jeep knee which  
um actually took one time before 
maybe you saw the previous video
this one
thank you very much yes okay how 
much we pay it eleven eleven pesos  
I think this is the cheapest 
way of transportation here  
because I think the pair is always just 11 
pesos no matter where you want to go it's  
always 11 pesos so no matter how far you go that 
is the minimum pair that's the minimum pair okay  
oh yeah there's even a side minimum fare 
11 pesos if you want to go long distance
yeah it's about 16 Pages like that 16 
pesos okay how about still I think very  
affordable no matter how long you you're 
gonna go oh yeah sure that's all over you
becoming a local here
all right that was a quick ride I think it was 
less than 10 minutes now so how do we continue now
overpass and then over there and then 
we take another jeepney ah so we just  
so Jeep me from here to BGC okay okay so okay so 
we testing the road over there and then apparently  
taking another jeepney over there oh I would 
have never found this without the local help
the same
Behavior oh so far I really like it here 
especially the people are very friendly  
and very welcoming and everybody 
speaks English that's very good yeah  
your country it's been a good night it's what it's 
very cold yeah it's not as hot as here normally  
we also have winter with snow and it's around 
zero degrees Communication in your country Four  
Seasons what are they uh summer sometimes is 
like this and then we have Autumn which is  
like 15 degrees wow and then winter like zero 
degrees and snow and spring is also like 15.  
so we're not always hot like this yeah 
very cold compared to here that's right  
no not really snow but it's raining a 
lot as well but not so strong like here  
no no not so not so much and 
in Winter we have snow yeah
yeah the cold weather is definitely 
nothing I miss about Germany  
in fact there's uh almost nothing I 
miss about Germany very happy living  
my life here in Southeast Asia okay 
we have a little Street Markets here
we have more jeepneys here people 
selling Coconuts on the street here
yeah you will notice later in the 
video our final destination BGC  
looks very different than this area so 
we're going to see a huge contrast today  
of different areas which makes it I think 
a very interesting and exciting day today
so here are lots of Street Markets
busy places oh
it is everywhere people selling all kinds of stuff 
here on the streets interesting place I really  
love places like this so much going on so much 
to see especially when you're new in the country
this looks like a jeepney station not sure if 
you can see it but there are many many degrees
this one here okay  
it looks like a bus station here for GPS first 
time I did it actually oh check it out okay
I know them but I don't know how to answer 
that question how much you pay again
thank you getting fully announced
squeeze in here now hello
here this time yes okay not 
just as much as I can do  
ah so now this time he is collecting 
the money I'm not sure the driver
that's okay that's a money change 
yeah he doesn't have change
and it's really hot in here I immediately 
start to sweat a lot because of course he  
don't have air conditioning and now we are not 
moving so there's no wind coming inside okay
now that we are moving there's 
a wind coming inside so it's way  
more comfortable and not as hot anymore all right
Okay so yeah I'm not in the area where I 
want to end up but you know I'm sure we can
maybe you already noticed a difference 
now the streets here look different
yeah I have been actually in 
this area you want to take a  
picture yeah yeah sure sure yeah McKinley Hill
I will finish my sentence in a second
so you also go this direction is really 
small yeah our building is okay okay
yes so um there's a mall around here called 
the Venice Mall the sentence that I started  
earlier is I have been here a couple of 
days ago because I actually have a friend  
who lives here and we actually went out on a 
night here there's there are some bars here  
so we went out a little bit because 
we haven't seen each other in a while  
and so I have been here once but only during night 
time so that's why I already know a little bit how  
the area looks compared to the other areas but 
yeah today we're going to full exploration around  
but yeah so I think you can already clearly 
see a difference between this area and the  
area we have been just 15 minutes right ago 
the difference will get bigger in a few minutes
so you have I think this is a housing area 
which is guarded with a security CCTV of course  
security here on the on the road as well okay 
thank you very much salamat for your help and  
good luck for your interview okay bye-bye 
bye-bye oh well so super friendly helpful  
and nice people awesome and yeah told me he's 
having a job interview here so uh yeah good luck  
with that in case you see this video I hope 
you uh did a good job at the job interview  
and yeah let's continue walking around 
here so yeah I am I am very impressed  
by we are already here the difference after 
just a 15 minute deeply ride and this really  
looks like like a different country it looks uh 
almost like like in the USA it really reminds  
me a lot about the United States here and you 
will see later in the downtown area even more  
right all right we have arrived at the Venice 
Mall looks already like yeah like in Italy I  
mean Venice is a town in Italy of course 
I've never been to to Venice I've been to  
Italy before but not to Venice and yeah looks 
like this old European architectural style here  
really cool and yeah really different from 
the buildings you usually see around here  
let's have a look inside maybe get a 
cold drink I could actually need that  
serious Watcher here so yeah maybe if you 
know Venice then you know Venice is famous  
for for the canals and you can take boat rides 
through the city and seems like they kind of  
rebuild it here check it out ah you have 
sworn boats over there and the water here  
looks very inviting after I've had to ride in the 
jeepney I would really like to jump in here now  
I think you are not allowed to do that okay let's 
see if we can maybe find a cold drink maybe sit  
down somewhere for a minute I'll check it out 
there people here dressing up in a funny way
probably uh taking pictures for tips
I like that I like the atmosphere here 
it's nice it's calm it's not too crowded  
it is a weekday afternoon at the moment
and yeah popular photo spots awesome like 
it oh yeah check it out how beautiful and  
peaceful it looks here people taking a boat ride 
exactly like like in Venice oh what a cool place  
I really like the architecture here and it 
looks colorful all the different colors here  
all right I found a little place to sit 
down here I ordered with a banana shake  
oh very refreshing I'm walking around here in 
the Heat and where the atmosphere is absolutely  
amazing I mean check it out we have the 
water here there's some some calm and  
nice music in the background people driving 
by here with the boats really really nice
it's only like five minutes right 
not 10 minutes it's not that far away
yes 150 that's okay keep the change thank you very 
much have a good day bye all right we have arrived  
at the downtown area and here before we will have 
a look around just to give you a quick little  
update about my traveling plans I'm going to leave 
Manila in the next days and then we are traveling  
to one of the most beautiful islands here in 
the Philippines and here for the next two months  
around two months I'm going to travel all around 
the Philippines so the journey around the country  
starts in the next days so the next video will 
be about yeah traveling to the first destination  
but yeah let's have a look around oh there's a 
higher slash water show going on at the moment  
but I can't cross at the moment but yeah check 
it out we have huge Modern Skyscrapers here  
the roads look so different actually there's a 
loud music of what they are so actually maybe  
I should walk away from it because the music 
is copyrighted and YouTube doesn't like that  
and this by the way is the area where I 
have been through already there are some  
some bars around here so I have been 
here with my friends a few days ago  
so this is here like a I don't really want 
to call it nightlife area because yeah just  
a few bars here some some nightclubs as well but 
it's actually very uh Lively in the evening here  
it was uh busy at least on the 
weekend when we have been out here  
you have little food places like this so yeah 
I think I don't have to mention uh what a huge  
difference this is between the area where we 
have been like an hour ago or a few minutes  
on the video and now and once again this is 
just a short 15-minute jeepney ride away from  
yeah basically where we started earlier so I'm 
really really surprised to uh yeah see an area  
that looks like this here I mean this almost hit 
like I am in America like in the USA we have big  
roads here the Airways clean and not so busy we 
have these huge modern buildings here we have all  
these Western Restaurants there's a Starbucks 
over there and high class fancy restaurants  
oh let me hurry up to make it over there in three 
seconds two one okay check this floating house  
this looks like like an old building in Europe 
right yeah so this is one of the most modern  
and richest area in all of the Philippines and do 
you notice something there's nothing really going  
on on the streets here no food is being sold no 
vendors no fruit stalls like you remember earlier  
at the area where we have been around the bus 
station there was so much going on on the streets  
all kinds of stuff is being sold you can get food 
everywhere and here whoa it's basically I would  
almost say it's borrowing because yeah the streets 
are basically empty nothing going on so yeah on  
the one side this area is of course modern very 
clean not as busy as the other areas but I would  
also say it's a little bit more growing you know 
what I mean it really looks like um yeah like a  
downtown in a big American city like uh the like 
a financial district in some big American cities  
so under one side I like it here because yeah 
it's a new and modern area but also it's a  
kind of more interesting in an area where 
there's so much going on on the streets  
you know what I mean here let me know in 
the comment section which area would you  
prefer an area like this or an area like 
the one where we have been earlier today
all right I came across a Mexican restaurant 
and I thought oh Mexican food I didn't have  
that in a while while we are here let's try 
Mexican food in the Philippines I have to be  
honest I haven't seen a local restaurant around 
here yet it's all these American Western chain  
restaurants here you don't find probably I don't 
really know do you find local restaurants around  
here at least not not on the streets somewhere 
like you saw in my other videos like where I  
got some milk like really on the street okay 
thank you very much so I am tacos burritos  
Mexican food usually is very delicious 
which is called caught on blue  
yes rice which with the Cordon Bleu which I 
usually very like so it looks very very delicious
oh yeah that's very good there's a 
little spicy kick to it so typical  
I would say Mexican kick to 
it but wow really delicious  
again oh my device is very flavorful so yeah 
I think it was very very interesting to see a  
different side of the Philippines today or let's 
say like it's a different site from the places  
that we saw in my previous videos so today we 
we saw that yeah the Philippines also have an  
area like this a very modern clean area with 
huge skyscrapers so I think it was very very  
interesting and fascinating to see here this side 
of the Philippines and if you haven't seen my  
video where I explored around one of the biggest 
malls in the world the Mall of Asia then check out  
the video right here to help you stay positive 
and then see you on the next episode ciao guys
