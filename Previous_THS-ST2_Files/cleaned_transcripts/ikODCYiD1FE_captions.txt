Hi guys! Somewhere deep in the Dutch
countryside is an old island fort used
as a line of defense for decades
it's called Geofort and we're headed
there last weekend.
We were sort of curious what it was all about
but since we have the museum card we decided to go.
It turns out that this is actually a
converted military fort converted into a
museum of cartography and navigation and
it's considered one of the world's best
children's museum according to the
european museum academy.
So we began our journey to find out what
is great about this museum and as we
And as we begin to wander around the different
interactive rooms
I knew my kids would like it here.
They especially like this sandpit room
that allows you to work with lighting
effects and create an active volcano.
Another interesting activity room shows
you how to make a compass.
Now to make your own compass you take a needle, needle that is currently not magnetic
But first you have to magnetize the
needle I mean by magnetizing the needle
it'll become aligned with magnetic field so
then you create a little take a little
cap you put  little slot in it,
you can put the magnetizing needle
you put the magnetized needle into the slot
this will be your compass rose
then you put it in the water and then
should start pointing north. Starting to turn. Good.
It's pointing in that direction. Now, now let's see
compass feature
And this is the iphone compass if I hold it next to it, north is indeed aligned with our home made compass.
Here's a topographical map of the Netherlands and
if you notice the color blue there shows
water because actually the mainland is
very rich in water.
I believe about 70% of the total surface
consist of water
It's so 'eng' (scary). It's not 'eng' it's cool.
it's so 'eng' (scary)
it's so 'eng'!
