so this here is the business this must 
mean open air wow that looks nicer  
to be honest Oh wrong doorknob 
all right so business class  
is not the move lady ladies and gentlemen 
it is not the move Alana Beach two
weeks
okay let's do it what's up everybody welcome 
back to another beautiful day here in Cebu  
City now today unfortunately we're leaving Cebu 
City but we will be back in a few days however  
we're heading to boho and we're actually heading 
there on a ferry so I decided why not tune on in  
and give you guys all the information you need 
to know about heading to boho from Cebu City  
and also of course share this experience 
with you guys now right now we're crammed  
in a taxi because I actually bought a brand 
new suitcase yesterday because our flight's  
um to Thailand and then back to the US after 
Thailand only allow us 220 kilo bags and to make  
them a 30 kilo bag it's ridiculously expensive 
so I just ended up buying a new suitcase uh  
Gladys is with me today of course hello are you 
excited to go see the beaches of the Philippines
beaches maybe the Chocolate Hills maybe 
some diving I don't know but I'm excited  
if we don't do any of that I'm excited to want to 
explore Explorer she's just excited to be here in  
the Philippines and so am I not right now we're 
approaching the ferry terminal we booked this taxi  
well we just actually waved it down right outside 
of the mall and yeah it was all quite easy to get  
here everything's super easy in the Philippines 
and I love that everywhere you go you never have  
any problems um people the taxi drivers especially 
are we just super nice and quick to use uh the  
meter can you hold this for a second yes I think 
I have oh I have it actually okay here you go  
There You Go sir thank you no change it's 
okay thank you you want us to get off here  
yeah okay yes ocean jet all right well let's get 
our bags out and we'll be good to go thank you sir
we already have our ticket 
thank you okay all right so  
there we go and then this is my new luggage that 
cost me 200 here in the Philippines literally 200  
bucks for this bag unbelievable thank you sir 
all right well we're here this here is Pier  
One of Cebu City this is the Passenger Terminal 
this is actually where you take ferries to ball  
hole and other surrounding Islands now you can 
actually purchase your tickets here at these  
ticket counters actually you know what let's come 
up this way you can purchase your tickets here at  
the ticket counters but we actually purchased 
ours last night on a website called one to go  
which I actually leave a link for you down below 
and of course not sponsored at all but if you do  
use the link I do get a small little Kickback 
percentage and you also get a discount so why  
not use it if you're here in Philippines or 
traveling anywhere in Asia use that link it'll  
help you out a lot but yeah all of the ferries 
can be found here they got the light fairies  
The kokalink Shipping Lines ticketing booths 
not sure what that is and then this year is  
the ocean jet line which is actually where we're 
heading to you oh sorry so we gotta wait in line  
now but I was actually here yesterday because 
I had problems um well I didn't uh want to risk  
missing the ferry this morning and my credit 
card kept getting denied for some reason when  
I was booking online but it was because I had to 
use a VPN so I downloaded a VPN used the VPN and  
now we're good to go we're on our way there I'm 
okay thank you I'm okay thank you yeah they're  
trying to sell you tours here in the line but 
we actually have everything booked for the next  
few days but yeah this here is the ticketing 
office for ocean Jets so you can come here book  
your business class tourist class or whatever 
Ferry you want to choose ours was actually 800  
Filipino pesos for the journey to bohang not 
bad hello I have an online booking ocean Jets
for a tourist class I believe
what's the I got a question what's the difference  
between um business class 
and tourist class [Music]
can I upgrade okay I would like to upgrade 
then to business class thank you [Music]
yes cool so yeah they offered three different 
classes they got a regular class a tourist  
class and a business class the tourist class is 
800 then the open air which is the regular class  
is also 800 and then business class is 1200. I'm 
actually upgrading to business class because she  
said you get reclining seats and less people in 
the cabin so why not it's an extra 400 pesos let's  
spoil ourselves I think it's like eight bucks 
extra so it's costing us roughly twenty seven  
dollars per person to make it across all the way 
to boho not too bad and look they even got senior  
and student discounts and you can actually take 
it we're going Cebu to tag bilaran which is the  
big city Oberon Bohol Island but they also got 
Cebu to getafe or Mock palompan and sebtag doom  
now um you don't have to book your tickets 
in advance you can actually book them here  
in person however during the peak Seasons 
you definitely want to make sure to book  
them in advance because you don't want to 
be stuck without um without without space  
on ferry but they do have fairies leaving like 
multiple times throughout the day pretty much  
from six in the morning until nine at night 
you can get on a ferry you're cute thank you
our new tickets awesome
thank you the other one here thank you and 
where do we wait okay thank you guess what I did  
I upgraded it so now we got 
business class let's see what  
that's all about and it was only 400 
more so around seven seven dollars  
not too bad right all right well you 
know what I think we're actually gonna  
I think we should cross the street grab some 
drinks from 7-Eleven and then make our way back  
here and board the ferry so you know what I'll see 
you guys inside the terminal here's the Passenger  
Terminal right here Passenger Terminal One um this 
is the main gate they got a coast guard office all  
kinds of local food shops 7-Eleven over in that 
corner and yeah the taxis pull up right here  
so super easy process man traveling around the 
Philippines has been incredibly easy so far and  
like I said pretty much everything you can book 
online however even with an online reservation  
you got to make sure you're here super early to 
um actually show your confirmation here and get  
the actual tickets in hand all right guys well 
I got me some snacks from the 7-Eleven got my  
luggage here Gladys should be making her way 
through right now there she is she's actually  
making a video as well so that's why we've been 
split apart but this here is the very entrance now  
um I do want to let you guys know man everything's 
going incredibly smooth I'm quite surprised that  
the Philippines is so organized but I mean this 
is one of the most touristic uh countries in the  
world so they make everything super easy for a 
tourists now this here is the main entrance I  
believe we got to go through a security checkpoint 
and the tickets actually don't include the bags  
the bags cost 100 pesos each I was just told so 
um just something to keep in mind make sure you  
bring some cash with you especially because 
once you get off at the ferry ports in Bohol  
you're probably gonna be getting a taxi as well 
so having cash is very very important all right  
let's jump on this ship and hopefully 
we get there in those two hours hello
okay I'm impressed guys this place is kind 
of like an airport so we're inside of the  
terminal now and there's air conditioning 
all kinds of places to grab snacks food  
and yam machines in case you don't got cash but 
do keep in mind that you actually have to pay a  
25 peso uh terminal fee once you make it inside of 
the main terminal and you do go through a security  
checkpoint there's also dogs so don't be trying 
to enter the ferry with anything that you're not  
supposed to be carrying because they're hard dogs 
they do got a rough security and you don't want to  
get caught doing anything dumb but yeah here's the 
oceanjet baggage counter the check encounter and  
this here is where everybody is sitting down and 
waiting for the ferry but yeah ATMs water bottle  
stations potato stands souvenir shops a cafe up 
there and this is awesome huh like an airport  
terminal like an airport terminal now I'm 
actually really looking forward to the ferry  
I was hoping it wasn't like one of those rough 
ones that they have in Thailand when you go over  
to Hotel the ferries are never that nice but not 
this here this is class I like it so we have to  
pay 100 for each bag and now we're on the ferry 
we barely made it too guys it's literally 11 40  
right now but um we're on board now now it's time 
to find the right area so this here is the Fort  
open air class passengers only hello where's 
business this is upstairs okay thank you sir  
all right thank you thank you so we're up 
here wow these seats don't look too bad at all  
so this here is the business this must 
mean open air wow that looks nicer  
to be honest Oh wrong doorknob thank 
you um seed number six six and four  
six and four yeah oh okay so this here is six 
this year's mine and there's lattices oh to be  
honest it looks better outside can we sit outside 
yeah of course all right let's just sit outside so  
we spent 400 for nothing we spent another 400 
for absolutely nothing you like better here right  
yeah it's way too squish inside there all right 
let's come back here all right so business class  
not the move ladies and 
gentlemen it is not the move  
well we just donated 800 pesos to the ferry 
company because that was absolutely terrible  
man there's no way no I was gonna sit in there 
it's full the lady downstairs told me that the  
business class meant less people and that you're 
gonna have more room but the it looks like the  
bottom class has more room in this one's full 
of tourists every seat is taken so I think  
everybody has like the same thought process like 
oh I'll pay a little bit more and be a business  
pass but no now we're in open air why not why 
not now we know that first very experience so  
the rest of the trip will be open air seats should 
be fun oh yeah we're right at the restroom why not  
hey in the freeze is nice sometimes air 
conditioning gets me sick I don't know if you guys  
are the same way let me know down in the comments 
but it should be an incredible uh Journey what did  
you think about the whole process so far oh my 
God I love that terminal it's like an airport  
I think the only problem we can can possibly 
have it's the sun the sun yes you know but  
inside of that that didn't even happen yet so 
beside of that everything is going so smooth  
the people are working very fast and well let's 
see how the ride is and like I said it's just  
our fault for spending that extra money but 
I was my seat was number six there was like  
some big dude sitting there like obviously I 
wouldn't be comfortable so I'd rather just sit  
out here but hey no complaining we're going 
to go baby hey 15 mistake it's awesome yeah
I get closer foreign
steak but like as a learning process and we 
got a lot more fairies to take here in uh the  
Philippines so we're gonna be good now we just 
know we like open air class it's the move hello  
bye bye Cebu City it's been a good time man 
I'm Gonna Miss This Place but we'll be back  
very very soon so yeah this here is the ports our 
hotel that we stayed at is actually directly in  
front of us that building up there that's popping 
up the summit Summit Galleria what a place you  
can actually see the mountain range on the back 
and right now we're about to go under one of the  
most like modern terrific Bridges that's called 
the seafood Cordova Bridge which is also pretty  
incredible but man this city is gonna be missed 
and man we're already going at some top speeds  
what a beautiful place yeah I personally think 
I'm gonna like this area a lot better and yeah  
look this here is the seafood Cordova bridge that 
takes you over towards like the SMC side of Mall
City and go straight to the beaches but I 
think you could definitely a lot some time  
for Caesar City this place is impressive it's 
so rich in history and it has a lot to offer  
a pretty important landmarks such as the Basilica 
de Santo Nino which is impressive and of course
it's cooking Spanish in a while we need to start 
speaking more Spanish the Cathedral of Cebu yeah
nice but yeah look at this bridge guys 
it is awesome there's a big cross on the  
um what do you call those on the pillars of 
the bridge another Little Ferry coming this way
beautiful place all right well right now 
it is 11.50 let's see exactly how long it  
takes us to get to ball hole I wonder 
if those people can see me over there
oh yeah I gotta wave I gotta wave they saw me
all right guys see you in [Music]
here [Music] all right so the business class 
was out the open air was cool but look at  
this the regular tourist class is awesome 
and they even sell snacks back here what  
this was the way to go all right so open 
air and tourist class definitely the best  
options when on the ferry all right let's 
make the line to get on out but everybody  
has the face like they're disappointed I 
mean no one was expecting the rain oh sorry  
no one was expecting the rain but it's not even 
like a small shower it's a it's a heavy shower  
all right it's gonna be a nice rest day all 
right so getting off the ferry was super easy  
bags came off completely dry I love how they take 
care of all the customers belongings definitely  
recommend that phone now right now we're about 
to look for a taxi there's all kinds of people  
with like signs that say car for hire we're 
heading to a place called Panglao which is like  
um the sister island of Boulder it's not far only 
about a 35 minute drive and yeah hopefully we can  
get there for quite an affordable deal so let's

small one okay let's take this one hello how

rule I love it but we love it because it gets 
kind of gross I mean coming into your home with  
your dirty shoes all right how do you open this 
oh like this hopefully there's no mosquitoes
oh this is nice
yeah I have proof of this guys all 
right well you know what I'm gonna  
get my swim shorts on I would show you guys 
the beach and the town but I think I'm gonna  
save that for another day should 
I save the beach for another day
I don't know it's hard to tell maybe yes because 
the wishes on video all right all right we're  
gonna we're gonna film the beach and our first 
reaction to our first Filipino beach ever  
um tomorrow or maybe later on today who knows 
but they also have a free shuttle here at this  
hotel as well that leaves every hour to 
Alona Beach and every hour coming back to  
here so we really got nothing to worry about 
I guess tomorrow let's have a straight Beach  
day tomorrow and then we go and explore 
Volvo are you excited to be here or what
before the reward there must be labor 
do you plan before you harvest you're  
so interest before you reap join what is 
so in tears I have no idea what that means  
look at this girl you can take the girl 
out of Venezuela but you can't take  
the Venezuela out the girl what are you trying to 
say when it sounds like to dance yes yes exactly
she's so funny to come back to Tokyo to the 
downtown Revolution this girl's too much guys  
well I hope you enjoyed that little travel day 
let me know if you're planning on coming to the  
Philippines if this video helps you out at all 
and please um stay tuned for the rest of our  
Philippines series it's gonna be lit all right 
say bye to the people bye bye people see you  
later alligators later guys we're out walking the 
streets now and I decided why not show you guys a  
little bit more now here on the streets I'm okay 
right now thank you bro now here on the streets  
man there's actually so much going on there's 
so many different local restaurants as well as  
food from other countries we just passed by an 
Italian restaurant uh Indian restaurant they got  
burgers and of course they also have some fast 
food chains like Jollibee and McDonald's here on  
the main streets now we're also noticing that 
there are motorcycle rental places everywhere  
I'm okay right now thank you we also noticed that 
there are motorcycle rental places everywhere as  
well and they charge between 300 to 350 pesos 
per day uh for a motorbike rental so I think  
we're actually going to do that you ready 
for a scooter trip around Bowling of course  
I think Scooter's the best way scooter cab 
yes scooter Vibes are always a good move  
you just got to be very careful because 
people always get these things that they  
call Asian scars and it's because they just 
yeah people eat it on the scooters and then  
they're walking around with bandages 
everywhere they heat them [Music]
Gladys barely tapped the um the exhaust pipe 
in it burned the [ __ ] out of her leg but  
that happens a lot too however yeah guys I 
mean so many different uh options for food  
rentals all kinds of things massage spots souvenir 
places tuk-tuks everywhere this is going to be an  
awesome place to lounge around and I also noticed 
that there was a lot of places here to do laundry  
we just passed by a resort that looks pretty damn 
expensive as well so a little bit of a little bit  
for everything can be found here we're okay right 
now thank you um people are so nice though too  
just like anywhere else in the Philippines 
but um yeah guys just wanted to show you a  
little bit of the streets I'll show you guys 
a lot more in upcoming videos but for now it's  
time for us to relax let's go find some food and 
maybe go hit the beach of course now later guys
[Music]
