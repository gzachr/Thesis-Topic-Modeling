thank you okay so there's a Filipino wedding
going on maybe that's why there's a lot of
cars here on the parking area well let me
share with you this one of the all this buildings
here in Cebu City the cathedral
so so far I have a very good impression of
this city very beautiful and I like it so
similar to my country guys I love it it's
crazy like we are so far but have so much
in common because of the people that came
to our countries right the Spanish so I like
to read the signs let me see if we can ring
uh we can read this one casero of siwu well
it's in Tagalog so I don't know what what
um those that mean but we have here 500 years
of Christianity from 1521 to 2021 yeah because
here Ferdinand magallion arrived to the Cebu
City in 1521 so I'm not sure it's if we can
walk in because there's a wedding but I'm
gonna make silence and go in to check [Music]
[Music] yes sir we have something
here present for your lovely wife according
to the right number six years
okay so definitely not a good time to go into
the church because they were actually asking
do you accept her as a wife and you know what
it's um very nice here people speak Tagalog
but also speak English so they were they're
having the ceremony in English the Father
the prince it's speaking English so here in
the Philippines people speak very good English
and then you love it because I win if you
watch my videos you know I went to Japan and
it's crazy in Japan that there's not so many
people that speak English so it's you know
a struggle but here they speak very very good
English
okay we have here the area to put our light
I'm gonna put one candle the candles is symbolic
of Jesus Christ as the light of the world
lighting candles in prayer especially in holy
places like in churches altars means that
the candle stand for the faithful that like
the candles I think I have a small coin a
candle yeah I have here 20 pesos look how
beautiful is the coin 20 peso coin um excuse

I think this is a good way to start your trip
here in Cebu come in say thank you to Jesus
in my case but to whoever you um think you
gotta be grateful for your life for your trip
