- It's kind of like ice cream,
but it has different kinds
of candied fruits and flavors.
- Oh!
- Yeah.
- That looks exciting.
- Alison.
- Oh!
Wait, that's good!
- Three, two, one.
What's going on everybody?
How's it going?
My name's Xiaoma.
Oh, my gosh.
What's up guys?
We're doing a very special Philippines..
Wait wait, do not...
We're doing a very special
Philippines edition
of the Xiaoma NYC Food YouTube Show today.
This is my friend John over here.
What's going on John?
Usually we do videos in Chinese,
but today we were thinking we're going
to make a very special
Philippines edition.
Why?
You might ask.
Well, the reason is
actually very, very simple.
So, John and I just now ate
at this amazing restaurant
called Jollibee,
and it was my first
time ever eating there,
and it was so good.
So genuinely delicious that we decided,
you know what?
Let's get some more Jollibee
and bring it
to New York City's famous Times Square
where there's all lots of
people, total strangers,
and we are gonna go and walk up to people
and ask if they want to try some Jollibee,
and see what they think about it,
and it should be really interesting.
Because, you know,
New York City just very recently
opened up this new Jollibee,
but still most people here
in New York City have not heard of it.
So, we are going to
introduce them to Jollibee.
Here in this bag we got fried chicken,
we got the spaghetti,
we got the peach mango pie,
and we got the halo-halo,
and we are gonna give it to everybody here
and see what they think about it.
Are you guys excited?
I'm excited.
Oh, and if you like this video
you can subscribe and leave a comment,
and let me know if you're interested
in these types of videos.
Let me know what other
sorts of Filipino foods
you guys would want to see
me give to strangers here.
Let's go ask some people man.
Hey, do you guys wanna try something
delicious for my YouTube video?
Filipino Fast Food.
- Yeah, I'm okay.
Thank you.
- No?
Okay, cool.
Thanks guys.
- Wait, actually?
- Yeah?
Yeah, we'll try it.
- Have you guys ever
heard of Jollibee before?
- No.
- Okay.
They just opened up a new
restaurant in New York City.
Do you guys want spaghetti
or fried chicken?
They have both.
- Fried chicken.
- It's a little bit spicy,
if you wanna grab one.
- Got it.
- Okay cool.
So, just let me know what
you guys think about it.
- Do I just have one?
- I'll bite it.
- Go for it.
- All right, my turn.
- What do you think?
- That is good.
- That is good.
- [Xiaoma] You can handle the spiciness?
- Yeah.
It is like the perfect amount of spice.
- [Xiaoma] Do you eat fried chicken a lot?
- I mean, yeah.
- Sometimes, I like fried chicken, yeah.
- How do you think it
compares to the fried chicken
that you usually eat?
- It's better.
- Better?
- Better, yeah.
- Better texture.
- Right.
- Yeah.
- Cool.
And then we also have a
dessert if you guys want?
We have ice cream?
- I mean, yeah.
- Yeah, sure.
- [Xiaoma] It's good, right?
- I love ice cream.
- Okay, great.
So, this is not quite ice cream.
It's a very traditional Filipino dessert.
It's called a halo-halo.
It's kind of like ice cream,
but it has different kinds of
candied fruits and flavors.
- Oh!
- Yeah.
- That looks exciting.
Allison.
- Oh!
Wait, that's good!
It's interesting.
I like it.
- [Xiaoma] Yeah.
- My turn.
- [Allison] Get one of those things.
- What things?
Oh, is this?
Mmm.
- Abby's finishing the chicken.
- Mmm.
- [Abby] Is it on my nose?
- Abby's turn.
- Can you spoon it to me?
- [Xiaoma] Have you ever had
anything like that before?
No?
- Nope.
- That is good.
- Thank you guys so much.
We appreciate it.
- Thank you.
Thank you, have a great day guys.
Thank you.
- You too.
Wow.
That was fun.
All right, let's go.
Have you guys ever heard of a restaurant
called Jollibee before?
- Yeah, I did.
- You have?
Have you eaten Jollibee?
- No.
No, okay.
So, they just opened up a new
restaurant in New York City,
and we're trying to see what
people think about the food.
It's the most popular
fast food restaurant in the Philippines.
- Chicken and stuff like that?
- So, do you guys want chicken?
Or we also have spaghetti as well.
- Chicken.
- So, it's a little bit spicy.
Not super spicy.
- Take a bite.
- [Xioma] Do you like it?
It's good, right?
- Mm hmm.
- [Xiaoma] What?
- A little spicy, yeah, yeah, yeah.
- It's not spicy.
- It's not spicy?
And then, if you want,
I have one more thing for you to try.
It's a peach mango pie.
Basically, it's sort of a dough thing
with peaches and mango inside.
It's a little bit hot.
- Here, take a bite.
- She just...
It's in your hand.
- What do you guys think about the flavor?
- Good.
- You like it?
- Peaches.
- Jollibee's it's called.
- Have you ever heard of a restaurant
called Jollibee's before?
- I never have.
- Cool.
So, it's a very popular
fast food restaurant
in the Philippines.
So, we want to see what
people think about it.
- I'm very excited.
- They have fried chicken and spaghetti.
- Fried chicken.
- Fried chicken, okay.
Of course.
- This is Filipino?
Yeah.
This is Filipino fried chicken right here.
It's a little bit spicy.
- What's gonna happen to me?
- Your mouth is gonna be on fire.
In a good way.
It's not too spicy.
- Oh, my God.
I'll give you a bar stool review.
Top fried chicken here.
Eight out of 10.
- [Xiaoma] Eight out of 10.
- That's a good score.
That's a good score.
- Nice, man.
- Definitely better than Popeye's.
Definitely better than Bojangle's.
Better than KFC.
This is good.
It's definitely next level.
It's definitely better than those ones.
Can I finish this?
- Yeah, it's yours.
- Thank you very much.
- Do you want any dessert?
We have ice cream or like...
- Yes.
(group laughs)
- This is a very special Filipino snack.
- [Man] Oh, he loves a good snack.
- Yeah, it's called a halo-halo.
- Oh.
- Looks like it spilled out a little bit.
- That's okay.
Now everyone wants to try it.
- What is this like?
- Oh, my God.
- [Xiaoma] You like it.
- I've never had these gummies.
These gummies are fantastic.
- The gummies are not
what I expected to be.
- [Xiaoma] Yeah.
- Fantastic.
This is great.
- Wow.
- I'm expecting a
jellybean, but it was not.
- Thank you guys so much,
I really appreciate it.
- No, I got this, I'm gonna finish it.
Can I finish this, too?
- Yeah, it's yours.
- Thank you.
- Aww, this is great, made my day.
So, now we have no more chicken left,
and we're gonna have to
see what people think
about the famous spaghetti
of the Jollibee restaurant.
Let's go.
So, unfortunately, we
ran out of fried chicken
because everybody ate it up.
But, we do have some spaghetti, though.
- I mean, it looks good.
- Yeah.
That's fast food spaghetti.
- I know.
- I like that.
- Yeah.
- It just looks like spaghetti.
- Right.
- If you don't eat it all, I'll eat it.
- Ooh.
- Right.
- That sauce, it's like.
Mmm, it's thick.
- It definitely wasn't
what I was expecting.
- That's not what I was expecting.
- I'm glad it's not what I was expecting.
- [Xiaoma] What were you expecting?
- Like he said it's sweet.
I wasn't expecting it to be sweet.
- It's not like normal Italian.
It's like, yeah.
- [Xiaoma] Right.
- Hey, I don't think you're getting any.
- No, that's fine.
(they laugh)
- I think we're eating it all.
- Well, we also have desserts
if you guys are interested.
So, this is peach mango pie.
- Do you care if I bite a
side and you bite the other?
- No, I'm not...
- I never really liked peach or mango,
but it tastes good together.
- I wouldn't think they'd
go together, though,
but that's actually pretty good.
- One second, give me a second.
- I'm gonna eat it again.
- I would eat it again.
- Where can I find it?
- It's really like a ten minute walk.
- Wow.
- I'd recommend this.
- Cool, yeah.
Try the fried chicken next time.
It's digging.
Just give it a try,
and let us know what you think about it.
- It's not bad.
It's good.
- You like it?
- Mm hmm.
It's really good.
It's not bad.
Where's the meat?
- So, I think they actually
forgot to put this,
there's usually a little
sauce sausage in there.
Yeah.
- It's still good, though.
It's really good.
If there was meat in
there, I bet it'd be great.
- Totally, totally, totally, totally.
I don't know if you've ever
had anything like this before.
It's peach mango pie.
- Oh, yeah I've had
something like this before.
- From where?
- Probably McDonald's?
- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Get you a napkin.
- Mmm.
This is a lot better.
It's really crispy on the outside,
and nice and gooey on the inside.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah,
And that's kind of like the
ones you've had at McDonald's?
- It's better.
It's better.
- This is spaghetti?
- Spaghetti, yeah.
- Pasghetti.
- [Shamla] Pasghetti.
- It's nice.
- [Xiaoma] Yeah?
- Do you wanna try it?
- No.
Try it.
- And you guys, we also have ice cream.
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah.
So, it's a really special
Filipino dessert actually.
It's called a halo-halo.
And it's kind of like candies in there.
Kind of fruits and stuff.
- [Man] Healthy.
- Oh, yeah.
- [Xiaoma] That one's good, right?
- That is really good.
This is a bit better now than this one.
- (speaking Chinese)
My friend John over here needs
to try the Jollibee spaghetti.
Oh.
Yeah.
(speaking Chinese)
- (speaking Chinese)
- Wow.
All right.
