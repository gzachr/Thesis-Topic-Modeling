How nice is that ?
That's cool. So romantic
it's so romantic
It's so beautiful
Let's grab the seat
watching life goes by
hahahaha was actually not that bad of a
subway ride I think it was what 20 minutes
from Queens ? from Queens yeah
to Central Park
Once you get off, you see that.
Yeah food right away
So cool that they filming a movie down here
horse-drawn carriages around so it's
right here off the subway exit you can
actually get on a horse-drawn carriage
if you want
yeah I didn't even expect to see that
in New York City in general it's located
It's located where again ?
It's located in between 66 and 77
that's gonna be something that always amaze me
Alright so directly across the street of Central Park
There is like.. a little shop called Pretz
And they have....
all ready-to-go; hot wrap and salad
and everything else so we just stopped in we gonna get something to eat real quick
I can't even distinguish American
who is New Yorker
it's melting pot I've read it before that
like Central Park is like a key part of
keeping New York City the way it is and
if there wasn't Central Park like the
pollution would be really bad like there
wouldn't be as many animals in New York
City a lot it would cause a lot of bad
things that happen to this so it's like
a key thing to maintain the ecosystem in
new york basically and the
squirrel also eat peanuts right
all right this is exactly like look like
a whole new town it's like a city inside
of the city yeah it doesn't give me the
feeling that we are in new york city
at one point of time when we just 
walked in we kind of like see the skyline
I mean all the way around 360 degrees
you see buildings all around me but it's
beautiful we walk a little bit further
and then we don't see any building
anymore let you look all around and it's
just GREEN you can see so many people like
you know either riding around with
snakes around their neck or doing big
bubbles or singing
YOU CAN DANCE
This is where the artist come to promote
themselves yes so let the world see their talents
Art works here is really cheap they sell
their artwork for like $5 $10 maximum
that I see some of them are like really
really good though yeah
the value of the picture and things look
like 100 bucks yeah you can also get
the water yeah how can I do it it
doesn't work Oh
especially today we have we got a really
clear day like yes it was pretty cold
but today it's nice and warm
yeah so fun fact like they can't
actually grow anything here in the park
until they imported all the soil from
New Jersey which allowed the trees and
the plants and everything to be able to
grow here in Central Park yes so
basically before it was once
like filled with just mud and swamps and
rocks trees and plants cannot grow here at all
but for some reason they want to do
the park here the decided have to import
all the lands and thing that can grow
the plants from New Jersey huge I'm
actually fun fact this place is one of
the most filmed location in the whole world
do you watch Romeo and Juliet yeah
Romeo and Juliet was filmed here so crazy
that they have like Citibank owns these
bikes called Citi bike and you can rent
them for a day and you can like ride
them to any other docking station and
drop them off at the docking station
they need docking station any docking
station in the city that is how cool it
is and it's a day passes $12 that's
really cool but if you lose it you pay
$1,200
Where are we right now ?
We are in Bryant Park
Right down the road from Time Square
It does not usually looks like this
these are from their gonna be filled
with stalls of like vendors and shops
and people can buy stuff, food 
be more like a little street market
Yeah it's a Christmas market Oh Chrismas market  gonna be here and what's
happening in the middle is actually
a park but they are actually turning that
into an ice-skating ring
Wow free ice skating really in winter
so cool that they offer like free ping-pong
free ice skating
all right in the middle of New York City
yeah exactly unfortunately we can't
really see but if you guys come in
winter definitely should check out Bryant
Park that is Empire State
all the food by they get it from
probably there's a lot of story the
Starbucks caters a lot of stores also
it's inspired from the main store and
nice bring it to the part that is really
good a mango
I just feel healthy suddenly you get
like
like kind of like
the fault of the food
yet he's still
sweet natural flavors
we never planned to visit the public
library and while in New York City I
mean I'm not a reader at all but we were
walking right on by it on Fifth Avenue
so we went in and found out that is not
just the library it's actually like a
museum wandering around inside we found
out that it's actually from a scene in
the movie day after tomorrow and we were
amazed by the architecture massive
artwork and special exhibits it's like a
place of refuge from the madness in New
York City
it's just crazy to see that in actually
in real life
that first Timmy Tommy we're gonna go to
translation and I was like transmission
all right what about translation and say
that is okay we're gonna go see this
wall
I know the neighbors right and then when
I step in here I just feel like that
this is what I seen in the movie I don't
remember the name of that movie exactly
like and look up
this is definitely a muscle on him
so much life can never know that hello
grandson there's actually a food oh yeah
I had no idea have you guys try eating
yes
Nashville office objection you have
supplied a defense application I was so
tired earlier
feel like you can make it
I'll give it a good month and this is
actually the small size but you get
extra it's like vitamins and stuff in
the jungle so we got you know a daily
vitamins and zinc so it gives you a
little bit extra energy
I don't do anything but I think you know
I
you talk in the corner of the wall
you can hear this story with someone no
I directly know but some of they know
that goes something else
the whispering laws
as Garrett says neurochemical was
it's cool we're gonna have no idea how
it's possible to be able to do that and
the fact that you can actually talk into
a corner
the whispering walls
from what
Grand Central Station signals they
should not buy the food
most of our restaurant
shall we go get a subway or something
watching
