hello guys welcome back to Pinoy Planet
today I'm making a max,s style chicken so
let's start okay so let's start with the
chicken legs
I will marinate them but the marinade is
gonna be very simple I'm gonna use some
suka vinegar and also patis or fish
sauce so I will start with adding some
patis or fish sauce
and also some vinegar guys not too much
okay so I will just rub this in
and I'm gonna leave the chicken for
let's say 30 minutes or so
okay so the chicken it's here in the
marinade guys I'm gonna chop up some
onions and garlic
took the onions and garlic the pan is
getting warm I'm just gonna add these to
the water
I will also add some ASIN some salt using a sea
salt
and some crushed black pepper
okay so now I will add the chicken and
then I'll bring it to a soft boil so
medium heat they're gonna cook it for 15
minutes
okay guys while the chicken is boiling
I'm gonna slice up some potatoes these
Dutch potatoes for making french fries
Dutch potato for french fries so not
sure if it makes sense guys but I'm
using Dutch potatoes for french fries in
a Filipino meal leave your comments
guys
so many potatoes to cut in the meantime
I see the chicken is ready so it has
been 15 minutes so I'm going to take it out
okay so I'm gonna put them on a
plate
and then I will let them cool off
completely and get dry before we will
fry them
okay so we'll let the chicken cool off
here and in the meantime I will finish
chopping the potatoes and I put them in
a bowl of water so that's almost done so
they're almost done guys I'm gonna leave
this in the water for a while
there were a lot more potatoes than I
initially thought
this is done with the cutting the
potatoes I'm gonna turn this water into
a nice gravy and when we're done with
that I'm gonna fry the chicken see you
later guys all I'm doing for the gravy
guys is the following I'm using three
tablespoons of corn starch three
tablespoons of sugar
I removed the onion and the garlic and I
tasted it and it needs a little bit more
saltiness so I'm gonna add also half a
cube of chicken stock
and then we will thicken it up and that,s it
it will be our gravy for the chicken
The oil is hot guys it's ready to fry the
chicken so I took the the moist off they
are cooled off also and I removed the
peppercorns
give it a try
flip them over guys
Wow look at that
pogi! guys there is pogi on the roof
I flipped them over a few more
times guys so now they're ready they
look really nice
I'm gonna take them out and then we're
gonna fry the fries
fries are almost done so let's do the
plating with french fries and chicken

the fries combination delicious so
