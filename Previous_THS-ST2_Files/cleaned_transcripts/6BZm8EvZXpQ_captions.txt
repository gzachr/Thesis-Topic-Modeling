But the weather is so hot
and my hair is itchy
So I came to cut my hair today

I feel half scared, half excited

I heard it's the best barber shop in Cebu. It's true
I really like this place because they have detailed haircut skills
It's been 8 months since I cut my hair... Very short 
I can't get used to it, but I really like it
