It's a smoked octopus tentacles??
Testicles?
Eh, tentacles.
Did I say testicles?
It's smoked octopus testicles.
There's also a squid. 
Hi everyone, welcome back to another episode of
Eatbook Food Guides.
It's been a long time since we did a restaurant food guide
and today, we're having Filipino food.
So of course, I got to invite my best Filipino friend in the house.
Mr John Lery Villanueva.
Hello!
Oh my god, I'm so excited for today's episode.
You know why?
Because this hits home.
And I've been craving for Filipino food for like two months already.
Wait, so what are your top three favourite Filipino dishes?
My top two is Sinigang.
I love Sinigang.
And Sisig.
Because Sisig came from my hometown.
Then the last one will be like, can be Adobo, Lumpia,
Tortang Talong, Kare Kare, Lechon.
Everything really.
Okay, that's everything.
A lot!
I'm excited for today because
I know we are going to three different places
at three different price points.
So whatever your budget is right, we got you.
So now let's go, our first location, let's go eat.
Now we already have the food in front of us and we are so hungry.
So here right, at Nana's kitchen,
actually it’s Muslim-owned.
So it's a fusion of Filipino and Malay cuisine.
So what we have here is Kare Kare.
Kare Kare.
So it's basically peanut sauce
with like some beef inside and some veggie.
And you eat it together with shrimp paste.
Right.
And this one is one of the best egg dishes in the world,
Tortang Talong.
It's just eggplant and egg.
I love these two things.
Lery: Okay.
Brenda: This garlic rice smells so nice.
Actually, I know when they bring it out just now right,
it smells so good.
We try the Tortang Talong first.
Okay, how do I eat it?
Do I have to dip it in the sauce?
No, just cut.
Oh.
Mmm.
Babe, oh my god, it's so good.
Yeah.
Oh, thank you, thank you.
Eh!
I thought it was going to be like sliced brinjal in pieces,
but then it's actually the whole thing.
This is the whole eggplant.
Actually, they will grill it first.
After they grill it right, they'll remove the skin,
then they will smash it, then they will dip it in egg,
then they'll fry it.
It's so fragrant.
I like the part with the eggplant.
The sides though are a little bit too salty for me,
which is why I need to eat rice.
Correct.
It smells so good.
Mmm.
Oh my god.
This tastes like hands down,
so much better than all the garlic fried rice outside.
It's the most fragrant garlic rice I've ever had.
It's really good.
As you can see right, they really have the garlic chips.
Now I want to try the rice with the egg.
It's a match made in heaven.
Okay, let's try it with the sauce.
Mmm.
Yeah, the sauce is sweet, very light.
What's inside, fish sauce?
Actually, I don't know.
Of course, usually when I eat this right, I eat with ketchup.
Ah.
And you know what, this entire set right,
with the garlic rice and the egg,
it's $8.
I would definitely buy it again.
Right.
For real.
Lery control.
We have another dish we haven't eat,
the Beef Kare Kare.
Shall we try it?
Okay.
You put it here.
You have an option to add like veggie.
Okay.
The last part will be the shrimp paste.
Oh.
Just a bit lah,
because if you put too much right, it'll be salty.
Then you eat.
You try you try.
You process, 
there's a lot of things happening right now in your mouth.
I understand.
So the peanut sauce is a bit like creamy and sweet,
then the beef is tender,
and then there's the crunchiness from the veggie.
And the shrimp paste right,
it just adds a hint of saltiness in it.
The term Kare Kare right,
is from curry curry.
Because it's like curry, you know what I mean?
That's what I'm suspecting lah.
I feel like it's actually a mix of Gado Gado and Rendang.
This is 100% authentic.
The taste, flavour profile,
the way they cooked it,
it’s what I have
whenever I eat this back home.
It's $12 ala carte,
but if you buy it with rice,
it's about $10.
I know this is only the first stop,
but I think I found my new favourite Filipino dish.
Sinigang was always a top.
Oh wow.
But now it's Kare Kare!
Oh my god!
Kare Kare.
Kare Kare queen.
Yah.
Okay so here we have what they call the Sago Gulaman.
Okay I feel like it's a little bit diluted,
but the taste is on point.
And when you drink right,
you've got this very weird fragrant aroma in your mouth.
I cannot explain, like vanilla.
Okay.
You said it's a little bit diluted right?
I shocked because it's very sweet to me.
Maybe because I usually take my drinks like kosong.
Like this.
But what's interesting is
it tastes like how my grandma makes grass jelly.
She adds like vanilla essence.
Oh correct.
It tastes like that!
That’s it, that’s it.
We really put vanilla essence inside.
It's very refreshing, but you know what?
After this meal,
it just makes me want to eat dessert.
So what is our dessert?
Our dessert is
Halo halo!
Halo halo!
Halo halo!
The traditional way of eating this actually,
don't need the straw.
Take the spoon,
you cover with your hand,
this, then you like that.
Oh so it won't spill.
Yah.
Then you mix everything.
Actually just now right,
they got a chunk of ube on top of the halo halo,
which makes it very authentic already.
Inside got banana,
gulaman,
Lery: Grass jelly.
Brenda: Jelly.
They got jackfruit also,
yah got nata de coco also,
some people they put ice cream also.
This is (I'm) not even kidding.
This is what I used to eat when I was a child.
You know?
I buy it when it's summer,
they always sell these.
The taste is freaking the same.
Oh my god, you feel like you're going to cry or something.
Yah!
Wow, and like they use evaporated milk.
Some people are a bit bougie lor they use coconut milk,
but I think if you use coconut milk it will be a bit Thai.
Very refreshing, it's great for Singapore's
super ridiculous weather.
Correct.
Wah, I think $4 as a dessert drink,
not bad.
But in the Philippines you can buy it for like
$1.50 or $2 lah.
Okay, I'm going to just give a disclaimer
that I'm rating from a Singaporean's perspective okay.
3, 2, 1.
4.5.
Yah.
I want to really give it a 5.
But I minus five because of the
saltiness of the eggplant just now.
When it comes to the flavour profile of the food right,
they have it on point.
Like also we will come back again
and again and again and again and again and again and again..
For me, I really love the ambiance.
I get a very homely, very comfortable feeling when I come here.
For the taste, as a Singaporean, it was very up my alley.
The beef kare kare is now my number 1 Filipino dish.
Wow.
Yah.
Okay and apart from that right, they also serve Malay dishes.
Ah yes.
We've got nasi padang and all.
So next stop right, we'll try all dishes Lechon.
Alright, we are now at Lechon Republic,
which is Lery’s go-to place when he craves Lechon.
Correct.
Alright, we are we have Sinigang.
Wow, proud of you eh.
We have Sisig.
Oh my god,
Okay.
We have Lechon.
Mango salad,
ensalada, okay.
And then we also have chicharon...
Chicharon Bulak Lak.
Oh my god.
I'm so proud of her.
Now she can name all the filipino dishes already.
Can we please start with the Sinigang?
Sinigang is like a sour soup.
They use lechon as the meat here.
But you can actually use  shrimp also.
Actually you can use chicken also.
If you're not familiar with it right,
I'll just say it's the Tom Yam of the Philippines.
All the juices and the oil from the lechon
spreads within the soup itself so it gets extra thick.
I would say even almost like creamy.
The meat right, there's a nice balance of like the fattiness
to the meat itself.
For Sinigang right, it should be the right amount of sourness.
Actually what gives a Sinigang it’s sourness.
So for this one right, they use the authentic way of cooking it.
You should use like tamarind and it's the unripe one.
They'll boil it, then they'll like mush it up,
then they'll like sieve it through.
Ya.
So you get the sourness.
This definitely tastes like home.
Yeah.
100%.
This sinigang costs $15.
Is it like affordable?
This is affordable for this portion right and it's made of lechon.
Actually Lechon in the Philippines right is considered expensive
because you only buy it for special occasions.
I feel in the Philippines, you get the same price.
It can I think safely feed like 2-3 people.
Let's go to the dish that I'm very familiar with because right,
this dish was invented
in my hometown.
The dish is called Sisig
but for this one it's a little bit different because they use
Lechon as the meat.
Brenda: What's usually used?
Lery: Okay.
For sisig right, they usually use the pig head
and they use the ears most of the time
and they will mince everything and like cook it together.
So when you come here right and you order the Sisig,
it will be served sizzling.
So the first thing you do is like take the calamansi and like
you know spill it over and then
you try to mix it fast.
I don't dare eat chilli like that.
No, no, I will mix it but do you eat spicy?
Can we eat it on its own first?
Oh my god, I'm stressed, I'm stressed, I'm stressed.
Since they use Lechon right, it is really very rich.
It's savoury, it's like so many mouth feels.
Flavour bomb.
Yeah, it's a lot of things.
So you must have your condiment
which is made of calamansi, soy sauce and chilli padi.
A spoonful of like Sisig, then you scoop a condiment.
Oh so much.
Yeah.
Okay, okay, hold on, hold on, hold on, my turn, my turn, my turn.
It kind of like cuts through the fattiness and savouriness of the dish.
Maybe because I like to really taste the essence of the dish, 
I would rather eat it on its own.
But this is an interesting concoction.
It is.
Wait, so how much is this?
Oh, the price is really really affordable.
The star of the show, the Lechon.
I know that this is like pork right, but what is this two?
It's so Lechon right, it's usually eaten with a gravy on the side.
A lot of people right, they say it's made of pork liver.
Wah, the sauce damn nice.
I know what you mean, it tastes meaty.
Because it's got the liver.
Why you take two?
Because I love skin.
Can you be patient?
I love skin.
Okay, cheers.
Cheers.
This is why I eat Lechon.
I need the sauce.
Mmm.
Eh
scare me.
Actually, it helps you to tone down the fattiness of the Lechon also.
Okay, I think for Lechon right,
it really depends on which part you get.
Some part right, it's a little bit like meat to fat
to skin ratio, it's a little bit more.
But if you just want it to be like,
just some meat and skin kind of thing, you might get
the meat a bit like tough.
If you come here, just order the Lechon on its own and eat it first.
Then if you like it right, then you experiment more on the dishes.
We got a portion of half a kilo and it's 25 dollars.
which is like, can fit like 4 people (portion), say real.
Now we are trying the mango salad.
So, they call it Ensalada.
This is just mango and the shrimp paste.
Okay, I'll try the mix as well.
The shrimp paste is like, so fragrant.
Sweet and spicy.
This cuts through the greasiness very well right.
So in case you feel jelat,
you just eat a one or two mouthful of this one, it will
help you already.
And then you continue eating the Lechon.
Ya actually now, you asked me to eat the Lechon again.
Brenda: I can.
Lery: Can.
We're going to move on to our last dish on the table
and that is Chicharon Bulaklak.
Basically, this is made of like deep fried ruffled fat.
So you know the intestine right, is the membrane.
It's actually very expensive.
So in the Philippines right, when you order this right,
you're really like oh my god,
should I buy this type of thing.
I rather buy other dishes.
It's a luxury.
It is ah.
Because it's hard to get.
And it's hard to prepare also.
Oh my god.
Stop.
You know like when we eat Wanton Mee,
then they have those like pork lard right.
What is pork lard when you have this?
Correct.
Come on man.
Mmm.
I was expecting like pork lard level, but it actually isn't that oily.
And in fact right, it taste like fried intestines.
It's so addictive.
I could have this with beer.
Mmm.
Correct.
I really like the vinegar sauce and the onion
because it really cuts through the greasiness
and like makes you want to eat more.
But actually it's been here for quite a while.
If you eat it once they serve right, it's damn crispy.
And I really appreciate that although it's like the membrane,
there's no like dirty taste.
Lechon will always still be the number one here for me.
But I didn't expect that this would be my second favourite dish.
My favourite dish would be the mango salad.
Because this one is my go-to already.
But after I eat this, then I eat the Lechon, 
it elevates the flavour more.
So when you come here, you order, the mains and all right.
But don't forget to order the Ensalada.
Shall we rate this place?
Yeah.
One, two, three.
Four.
Although this is my go-to place right,
but I feel like sometimes right, yeah I agree
with you, the flavour can be a little bit heavier.
Even though you want to enjoy all the dishes you cannot, 
you can really just like choose
one at a time.
Yeah.
Overall, would I come back to this place?
Yes, I will still come back here.
Because the Lechon here, 
I would just say is one of the best in Singapore already.
Actually if you have five people, you can order three dishes, 
enough.
And I think it (will) only cost you about $10 to $12 per person.
I minus one right, it's really mainly because
I would only have this for dinner and not
lunch because I need to function throughout the day right.
After I eat this, I really cannot function guys,
my brain is foggy already, I'm not even kidding.
Our next location is a little bit more fancy and atas.
Actually I've been to this place more than once.
Correct.
I really like it, so without further ado,
let's go!
Before we eat right, we have two very pretty drinks in front of us
that I really want to try.
Mine is the mango float, there's like torched Italian meringue on top.
Actually mango float is a very famous dessert in the Philippines.
Usually right, Christmas and New Year's Eve, they always serve it.
Then for mine right, I have the Barbie's Potion,
it suits my personality.
This is non-alcoholic.
This is alcoholic, so you have like choices lah
depends on what you want lah, cheers.
Cheers!
Oh wow, that is really nice.
I love the meringue on top because it adds a different texture.
Oh wow.
It's so good.
I love that it's very smoky.
It has a very smoky like flavour.
It does.
Okay okay, now that we're done with this.
Okay shall we try our go-to first?
Yes, the Pork Logganissa.
We'll be having the Pork Logganissa.
Okay.
Logganissa in the Philippines right, it comes in different variety,
it depends on which region you are.
Okay I can’t wait to eat already.
I know it's gonna be good.
If you go Kubo right, this is a must try.
I really like it because it's like a medley of different flavours 
and textures.
The cured egg really completes the whole dish for me
because of that creamy texture.
They also have a hint of spice which I really really like.
As a Filipino, like the Logganissa taste right is on point.
But here at kubo right, they make it a little bit more special.
You know what, this reminds me of a deconstructed 
Asian hamburger and everything else is very indulgent
but the pickled cucumbers really cuts through.
Because in the Philippines, the traditional way of eating Logganissa 
is that you know you dip it inside the vinegar.
So that's how it replicates that thing here.
Shall we try...
Okay please let's do the crab...
Oh yes, the Crab Fat Risotto with Tobiko, yes I love this Risotto.
I love this also.
It's so good right.
It's so good, so umami.
So crab fat right, they call it Aligue in the Philippines.
Yeah so you literally can buy like jars of crab fat in the Philippines.
You make fried rice or just like take steamed rice and you put it,
you eat it.
So instead of oil,
Yeah, just use it.
you use crab fat.
Oh can smell the calamansi.
When you buy the jar in the Philippines,
it tends to be like very flavorful, no very rich.
That’s why I like that they use calamansi here,
it really cuts through that.
And I really like the texture of the Tobiko.
I wanted to say that also.
The risotto is like soft and creamy right but then
every time after the end of a bite,
it's got the pop pop pop ya, I love.
You made me learn a lot about the Philippines.
I have to be honest, when I came here that time when I tried this,
I was like,
how is this Filipino?
Right but then now you explain to me
then it makes sense to me now.
Okay next dish.
Oh yeah wait wait, I cannot choose.
Okay okay you know, both I never tried before, you tried before?
Same, I never tried before also.
Okay well now I'm nervous, now I'm nervous, now I’m nervous.
I'm feeling more of the octopus.
Okay the octopus.
It's a smoked octopus tentacles.
Testicles?
Eh tentacles, did I say testicles?
It's smoked octopus testicles, there's also a squid.
Apart from the smoked octopus tentacles, 
you see it's like a little bit black right?
Because there's squid ink brine.
Correct. 
The best way to eat this is to scoop it into the papadum
and then eat it all together.
There is no glam way to eat this.
The octopus tentacles is very tender.
The papadums, oh my god, it really adds like more flavour.
So Lery, inside right, there is Adobo brine.
And really this reminds me of like Adobong Pusit.
Oh!
So Adobo Pusit, Pusit is octopus.
I love it, the sauce is not overly salty.
I think it pairs very well with the octopus tentacles.
Okay lastly, we have the beef.
Yeah my Filipino accent came out already.
So Beef Pares right, it's like beef stew.
Usually it's eaten with garlic fried rice.
But now here in Kubo, they make it into a donut.
So they converted the rice into a donut form.
They put Beef Pares inside to infuse it.
This dish is seasonal, so it might not be available all the time.
Shall we cut it?
Yeah, let me just.
Let's go.
I want to say this is going to be a bomb.
I can imagine what it tastes like already.
The smell is like you go Philippines, 
you find a cart that sells Beef Pares,
you go there, you smell, on point.
It's like this ah.
It's literally like that.
But I like that the beef is very tender.
The beef stew is savoury, the donut is slightly sweet.
It blends well together.
Because the Beef Pares seem to be very strong and flavourful.
That's why they like, pair it with garlic fried rice.
Kind of like cuts through that.
But this one, they use a donut.
Like how did they think of this?
I don't even know how they put it inside here.
How did they put the stew inside the donut?
For dessert, we have what we call Turon.
What's Turon?
Basically, Turon is made of like, banana, but it's the unripe one.
Is there a reason why you'll use like unripe bananas?
Because right!
When you wrap it with a spring roll wrapper,
then like you know, you put sugar wherever you want,
then you deep fry it, then you cook the banana.
And this one got like, spring roll on top,
and got like jackfruit.
Oh my god, I love jackfruit.
And there's also cream,
there's like caramelised apples and figs as well.
And of course, look at the very fancy gold flakes.
Ooh, I want to get a little bit of everything.
That's why I cut in the middle.
So many different flavours.
It's like a banana
pie or banana pancake had a baby with an apple pie.
Wow, okay.
I like that the jackfruit right,
it actually the sauce of the sweetness.
The flavour profile is very like, neutral.
Like nothing overpowers everything,
but you can actually like, taste all the components inside.
The fried spring rolls,
it actually lived up to its name, as a Turon.
Because once you eat Turon right,
you always have that crunch.
Yeah.
And you know like you're peak Asian
when you say a dessert is not too sweet.
This is it leh.
It's delicious but it's not too sweet.
Oh my god, we're gonna finish the whole thing.
I'm so full.
Lery, it's time to rate this location.
Are you ready?
Ready.
3, 2, 1.
Brenda: 4.5.
Lery: 4.
Oh my god.
What I really like is that,
every single dish right,
injects an element of like, Filipino cuisine.
So many new things I tried today that really impressed me.
to want to try other things.
From a Filipino perspective right.
Actually this is something that is very unique for me.
You have a different experience,
but you still have those flavours that I'm familiar with.
I think you talk to our viewers a lot about like,
how the Filipino cuisine is injected into the dishes here.
I think this is definitely a very date-worthy place.
Then you come here right,
then every time you eat a dish,
you explain like, why is it like that.
Yeah if you're sick of like, cafes lah,
all these restos around, Spanish food or whatever,
please try Filipino food because you're missing out.
A lot of my friends always ask me,
Eh Lery, where to eat Filipino food, whatever.
There are places here in Singapore that you can get it,
and Kubo is one of them.
How was your experience today?
Amazing.
It was fantastic.
I not only ate so much different Filipino dishes,
I also learnt a lot about the cuisine and the culture.
I feel like the places that we really went here for today,
really represents what Philippine cuisine can offer.
That's a tough question.
That’s a very,
why are you putting me in a very tough spot?
Today we really tried three different places,
with three different USPs.
So it really depends on what they want.
If I have friends who are very comfortable with Filipino food,
I would definitely recommend them to go to Nanay's Kitchen,
or Lechon Republic.
But then if I'm introducing Filipino cuisine to someone
who hasn't tried it before,
I would bring them to Kubo.
That's a very good one.
Because it's a very friendly introduction you know,
it's not like,
it's not like,
Hey!
Lery: Hey this is Kare Kare, this is Tortang Talong.
Brenda: It’s like hi, it’s like hi.
Okay I have an easy answer in my head,
think about like, the core of who you are okay.
Okay ready, you have an answer?
Three, two, one.
Nanay's Kitchen.
I think it's mainly because I've tried some Filipino dishes before,
but whatever I had at Nanay's Kitchen,
I've never tried before and it really really impressed me.
The strongest selling point for me is that it's super duper affordable.
I'm an Eastie,
the location is in the East so I'm kind of biased.
I'm definitely going to go down again.
When it comes to like those dishes that you cannot
really see in other places,
we can actually find at Nanay's.
I want to do a special shout out to the 
Beef Kare Kare from Nanay's Kitchen
because it really blew my mind
and it's something that I can see myself eating regularly.
I'm not going to pick anything from the main dishes
because like for me right,
I'm not surprised with like anything but,
except for the Turon at Kubo.
It's not like the very like normal way
that you have it in the Philippines,
just like a whole new experience.
