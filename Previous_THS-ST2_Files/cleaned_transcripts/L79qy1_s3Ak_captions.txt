- Oh my gosh,
I'm so freaking happy.
I'm just feasting over here.
- Definitely something I wish
my mom would have made
a little bit more.
♪ (French accordion music) ♪
- (FBE) So, we have some
popular Filipino dishes
for you to try today.
- I get to eat something?
- (FBE) Yes.
- So exciting and Filipino?
That's even more exciting.
- Oh my gosh.
I have been waiting for this.
I am so freaking hyped.
- Ooh, this is fun.
This is really fun.
I did a project on the UN
in my sophomore year
of high school and our country
was the Philippines.
- The Philippines was conquered
by Spain at one point,
so the foods are all different
because all these European
influences clashed with
Asian influences.
- (FBE) The foods we're
presenting you with today
were made from a local,
authentic Filipino restaurant
called the Kalesa Grill
here in Los Angeles, California.
We know there are a lot
of popular Filipino dishes,
so we are just having you
sample a few.
- Okay,
- (FBE) And I'm gonna do
my best to pronounce
these meals correctly.
- You do that
to the best of your ability.
I can't even do it.
- I am half Filipino.
I am a big fan of sinigang,
which is this soup.
It's so good,
probably the best type
of food ever.
- I don't know if I've
actually tried proper Filipino food.
I wish I knew more,
but I don't,
so maybe this will
educate me.
Maybe I'll have my new
favorite food.
Who knows?
- I've eaten a lot
of Filipino food
because I have Filipino friends.
I don't really know the names
of the specific things.
It's not about the name,
it's about the taste.
- Let's do it!
- (FBE) Here is your first
Filipino dish.
- Thank you.
I don't like hard-boiled eggs,
so that automatically
makes me sad.
- We have egg,
which is great.
If anything, I'll enjoy that.
We have some sort of meat.
- It's yellow rice,
which is also--
oh wait, no.
It's noodle.
Oh my gosh.
- Let's dig in.
It's so good.
- Okay, yeah.
I like this.
- The meat in this
is too soft and it just
kinda melts when it
touches my tongue,
so I don't really like that.
- It's a lot of different
textures, but they're kinda fun.
- Every single Filipino party,
you will find this right there
and it'll be gone
in three seconds, too.
- (FBE) This is called
pancit palabok.
In Filipino cuisine,
pancit is noodles
with shrimp sauce
topped with ingredients
like hard-boiled eggs,
green onion, and pork.
- Oh, it's pork, okay.
They like a lot of pork
in the Philippines,
so I'm okay with that.
I like pork.
- (FBE) The term "pancit"
is derived from
the Chinese Hokkien word,
which literally means
"convenient food."
- I do kinda see how this
would be a convenient food.
It's simple ingredients
and this is definitely something
that I could see someone
just make for lunch and just
kinda take it on the go.
- That's why it's at
every single party.
Every single lola makes it.
They'll just shove it
onto your plate and be like,
"Eat your pancit
or else you're not leaving
this table if you don't eat pancit."
- (FBE) All right,
here's your next one.
- A stew?
- This is sinigang!
Oh my gosh,
I'm so freaking happy.
I'm just feasting over here.
- It looks like maybe fish
or something
and I really, really, really
hate fish.
- It smells kinda sour.
- Oh my gosh, this is literally
my favorite thing ever.
I love it.
It's just the right amount of sour,
'cause it's a sour soup
and it's so good.
- This is good.
It just tastes like
a chicken broth.
It's really simple.
I do like this weird vegetable
looking thing.
It does kinda add
a tinginess to the flavor.
- Not my favorite.
Definitely fish, I was right.
Fish just has that weird
aftertaste.
- It's gingery and it feels
very nice on the mouth.
- I like the flavors in this
and I like how fresh
everything is and it tastes
really good.
- (FBE) So this is called sinigang,
which is a kind of soup or stew
characterized by its sour
and savory taste
most often associated with
tamarind.
- Tamarindo, that's a fruit.
I liked it.
This is definitely something
I wish my mom would
have made a little bit more.
- I think the sweet and sour
part of it really makes it different
along with the vegetables,
'cause you usually don't
see that many vegetables
in American soup.
- I don't know if this
is a cold remedy,
but in the winter time,
I would pull up with some of this
and then be all good.
- (FBE) Here is your next
Filipino dish.
- Ooh.
Oh my gosh,
I just had this the other day
and it's good, too.
I forgot what it is, though.
- The sauce is definitely
a lot creamier.
It looks a lot thicker.
The meat, again,
is really, really soft.
- Is there peanuts in this?
- I'm pretty sure that's beef.
It's actually really not spicy,
but it looks spicy.
- Why does it taste
like peanut butter to me?
- I really like this so far.
I feel like they took
some peanut butter and went,
(imitating whooshing)
- It's like a whole party
in my mouth.
It's so good.
- (FBE) This is kare-kare,
a Philippine stew
with beef and tripe
complemented with a thick
and savory peanut sauce.
- Oh, is that what that is?
That makes sense.
It's kinda just that slight
salt taste that you would have
in peanuts.
- I didn't know that peanuts
could be made into a sauce
like this that complements
a meat well.
Definitely something that I'm glad
the Filipinos thought of,
'cause now we get to enjoy it.
- (FBE) Here's your next dish.
- Oh, it's dry.
- This looks like chicharron,
which is pork rinds.
- It's chicharron.
I love this stuff.
- Oh, crunchy.
That is really salty.
- It is.
It's chicharron!
I don't know if it has
a different name,
but it's dry, it's crispy,
and it tastes like bacon.
- Literally my favorite snack,
probably.
I think Mexican chicharron
is a little spicier,
'cause they like their spices,
but us, we just--
we like the saltiness of it.
- They taste like pork rinds
that you would buy
at a convenience store,
or the bodegas at the street corner.
- (FBE) This is pork chicharron.
- Chicharron, hm.
- (FBE) It's a dish generally
consisting of fried pork belly
or fried pork rinds.
Also popular in Spain,
Latin America, and other
places with Spanish influence.
- I didn't know it was
called the same thing.
You definitely can't go wrong
with this food.
This is something you take
everywhere.
It's really good.
It makes your breath
smell really bad though.
- The Spanish colonizers,
I forgot about that.
The pork rinds are good
and it's just slightly different
than how the Spanish or Latinx
countries do it,
which is interesting.
- (FBE) All right, last one.
- Ooh.
Looks like a honey cake.
- It's gotta be a dessert,
'cause it's yellow.
- This is good.
Sweet and sticky.
- It's really good and it's not
a sweet as American cakes,
which is refreshing.
- It's a little sweet,
but not too much.
It's not bad, but I'm not
gonna like, "Oh man,
I really want this."
- It does have sugar
and it is kinda sweet.
Not overpowering
like the cakes that we make
here where they're just
all whipped cream
and all chocolate and vanilla.
It's gross,
so this is definitely
a good change.
- (FBE) This is cassava cake
made with cassava root, sugar,
and coconut or condensed milk.
- That's interesting.
Where do they get these
freaking weird ideas
to make cakes out of roots?
- (FBE) This is traditionally
from Vietnamese origin,
but the Philippines adopted
this treat, putting their own
twist on it.
- That's cool.
I think of it more of a spice
or something you put
in a more savory dish
that I never would have expected
it to be in a cake or a dessert.
- I do like the consistency.
It's not slimy or anything.
This was amazing.
I think this might be
my new favorite cake.
- (FBE) What did you think
of this Filipino food today?
- I really liked it.
The different makes
of different meats and stuff
like that, that's super
interesting to me
and so different from
what we're used to here.
- I've never had Filipino food
or I've never gone
to a Filipino restaurant
and after this, I would
100% consider going to it
because it was all
really, really good and interesting
and nothing like what I expected.
- This was clearly just probably
one of my favorite episodes.
All you lolas out there,
keep making that dank food.
