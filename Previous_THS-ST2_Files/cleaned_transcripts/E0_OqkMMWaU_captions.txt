in this video I'm going to show you guys
the Metro Manila MRT and LRT which I
think are trains I had no idea they had
a train system here in Manila I heard
they're building something but I didn't
know there was one here I'm too cheap to
pay 500 pesos for a taxi back plus this
is a great way to go ahead and see how
the locals travel right palm yes I'm so
excited because from what I see
um from the Google Map it's just 28
pesos 28 peso each and we just finished
here at the Manila Boardwalk the
Dolomite Beach so I think they got some
unique form of like sand there it felt
really Rocky and hard right to be honest
not the greatest Beach but it's
definitely a unique kind of beach right
so
um
yeah free entry right so let's go ahead
and show you guys how to take a Metro
LRT MRT here in Manila let's go
[Music]
hello this is what you do massage wow
okay so how
much okay okay hello man thank you
okay for sure this is a nice tool what a
fun guy on the way here you say hello to
us and I kind of ignore him to be honest
I wasn't sure what kind of massage you
were talking about but now I now I know
it's talking about legit massage like a
proper thing so yeah I wish I was taking
a massage but maybe next time
um we just finished looking at the
intramurals we're in Fort Santiago which
was great as well as a cathedral church
what do you think of the historical
places here
it's so interesting for sure because
like um it's really what happened we
don't have that in Thailand so this is
kind of like kind of new for me yeah and
also they have a lot of spots to take a
picture so I love it yeah I must check
out place if you're in Manila let's see
if we can find the MRC LRT or fall on
Google Maps so hopefully we don't get
lost and let's go
[Music]

across the road we barely made it but
yeah let's go find the MRT and LRT this
is fun I love it it's kind of hot though
so bring yourself a towel I'm starting
to learn you know I got a umbrella here
today could have took you guys advice
everybody told me to go ahead and uh
drink coffee in the middle of the day
which I do and also to carry an umbrella

lot

I I'm following I'm paying attention I'm
catching up I'm picking up what you guys
are putting down okay so I got myself an
umbrella oh look at me I'm becoming more
and more Filipino every day
all right
oh thank you
as we walk to the Metro as you can see
this area is a little bit different from
the area we're staying at and our first
video we showed you guys it's a little
bit more modern more westernized a lot
of like name brands that recognized from
the West like h m McDonald's you know
all the regular stuff right so
um it's a little bit less local but you
can still find a lot of cool things like
the jeepney that's still going around
people selling stuff and yeah so Manila
is very big and diverse you can find all
kinds of things uh from local to Modern
uh there's of course the BGC in Makati
area yeah and the kids everywhere very
friendly hi what's up high five get one
of these yeah buddy let's find a train
station
chillies oh fish okay that was Chili's

foreign
[Music]
two tickets to EDSA
other side so how do I get there

off to a good start sweating though
I know what it looks like
[Music]
wanna get inside let's go

thank you
[Music]
yes a lot of people
[Music]
that was our LRT experience it's time to
catch the MRT once again off the stairs
I'm sweating I'm tired let's go
we gotta have some strong kneecaps
a good workout though no wonder
everybody in the Philippines is thin
slim and a good shape
ah how are you feeling mom I can't feel
my mom I'm so tired
still like have to climb the stair
s long enough relatively right you can
do it yes let's see the MRT
[Music]
oh look at that lineup
I guess it's a security checkpoint
unfortunately the line is way too big uh
we don't got time to wait in this line
because we got to be somewhere but at
least you got a chance to see what the
LRT looks like uh let us know what you
think if you're taking an MRT lrc here
in Manila it's definitely a great way to
skip the traffic but if you got a line
up like this I'm not really sure how
long it's going to take to get in there
and once we're in there I'm not sure how
long it's going to take to actually get
on the train we got to be somewhere in
an hour so I'm not sure we're gonna make
it but I hope you guys found a good
informative I had a great time I got a
great chance to visit some places to see
some places and experience traveling
like a local
a nice day it's a nice experience and
also this is the first time here in
Manila for me everything is so excited
and it's kind of like a little bit sad
for me that I didn't have experience
about the MRT one because the life's so
busy and like we have limited time so
maybe next time we will try again and
especially it's a great experience with
the LRT right yeah and it's so cheap
it's a good system and also today I
really love the Ford that we've been sit
here and also the princess yeah sorry
