oh hello guys I'm just checking out the 
weather here and it looks gorgeous so  
you know what today I'm 
gonna take you out for a spin
all right guys we're out
it's so lovely
the place is like the ghost town at the moment
remember I told you guys I live very 
close to the church well here it is
i know i told you guys that I'm going 
to take you out for a spin but as you  
know or probably you don't, Ireland is a level 
five restriction at the moment and that means  
we can only travel within five kilometers 
from our house and also i don't drive here
yet
one of the things that Ireland is 
known for is its fickle weather  
you can experience the four seasons in 
one day and sometimes even in five minutes  
all right guys so now we're in the park 
this is where people normally go for their  
daily exercises like walking running you can do 
cycling here I think and also walking the dogs
I'm freezing I'm not sure if you can see
there's not a lot of places to go 
anyway so might as well take this a walk
now we're in my favorite hangout place
the playground
okay guys I'm taking my glasses 
okay how does that look now
this rarely happens here I'm telling you
I'm going out of the park now and 
i don't know where to next oh look  
it's the list of all the 
candidates in the rose festival  
oh it's a massive event where ladies 
from different parts of the world  
like who are half Irish and half something 
else travel here to join this pageant
let's see if there's someone from the Philippines 
not yet but we're gonna put someone there soon
video
all right guys now i'm walking into an alley  
if i remember correctly this is 
going to bring me to the Square  
no i am sure i am sure this is going to bring 
me to the square yeah it is indeed the Square
the whole town center you'll find a lot of shops 
but that's just about it everywhere else is  
residential but there is a place manor west i'm 
not sure if i can bring there it's quite a walk
i think i'm done playing for 
the day i hope you enjoyed  
all those shots i'm losing the light anyways so
