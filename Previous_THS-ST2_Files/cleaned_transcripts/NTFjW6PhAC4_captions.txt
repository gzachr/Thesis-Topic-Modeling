hello everyone I am Hector from Venezuela and 
we just watched the Miss Universe Philippines  
2023 preliminary competition I have my top 10 
and I have my winner I gotta tell you something  
in the last video I made some mistakes when I 
spoke in English because I said something like  
"she have" something and that doesn't exist 
like it's not correct so if you see that I am  
doing something wrong please help me because 
I'm trying to improve in this opportunity I'm  
gonna introduce you my top 10 my final top 10. my 
top five is in a specific order let's begin with  
Miss Universe marinduque I gotta be honest some of 
the girls were fighting this spot until I saw her  
in evening gown where she surprised me because 
she was daring she used a Daring dress and she  
was playing with the dress in a graceful way and 
that's the reason why she is here because she gave  
her performance and I was satisfied watching 
it Southern leite she's a pretty pretty girl  
um sometimes I feel her a little bit weak about 
her catwalk I feel that she needs more energy I  
mean that she can improve that for the final 
night I think that she needs to concentrate  
in the adrenaline that is in the stage and show 
that adrenaline reflect that emotion she's calm  
she's elegant her dress was beautiful not only 
the design but also the color it looked like  
a total princess zambales she's the pasarela 
coach she knows how to slay in the stage she's  
so focused on showing us that she's ready in this 
competition that she is not going to give up all  
the eyes are around her and I've seen her improve 
a little bit more in each event and I couldn't ask  
more of her in this presentation because I think 
that she gave us everything what we were waiting  
to see on her Cavite so gorgeous when I'm talking 
about Miss Cavite my heart explodes in beautiful  
emotions I loved her evening gown portion because 
she looked magnificent looked like a celebrity  
one of those celebrities that appeared in Met Gala 
she reminded me of those celebrities Miss Universe  
Davao Oriental she's classic she's fantastic 
she's elegant it made me doubt a lot because  
I didn't like that gown I think that she didn't 
felt 100% comfortable she looked beautiful as  
well but also what you projects it comes with the 
comfort that you feel in the moment and I didn't  
feel her comfortable but I know that in the final 
night she can wear another dress and it's going  
to be all okay probably she can surprise us she's 
just in my top 10 almost getting the top five top  
five fourth runner up of Miss Universe Philippines 
is Miss Cebu Province the first time that I looked  
at her I was doubting like she doesn't convince 
me a lot I don't know I don't love her but when  
I saw her recently in all these events I have 
to recognize that this contestant has something  
and it's something special is something beautiful 
tonight she looked so amazing third runner up Miss  
Universe Makati it's one of those girls that 
I think has most of the potential physically  
but sometimes it's like lacking of giving us 
everything what we're expecting but I really  
do think that she's gonna be in the top five for 
sure because she deserves to be in there but I'm  
really doubting if she's gonna win if she's not 
gonna win I mean everything can happen and all  
this great background of helping people of having 
a beautiful purpose project that's gonna help her  
for sure second runner up Miss Universe Bohol and 
probably you are going to ask, Bohol again? I have  
to congratulate her because I know that she has 
received a lot of criticism we have criticized her  
because sometimes we say wow she's so beautiful 
she has these qualities why she doesn't work it?  
but tonight she worked everything International 
Pages have recognized her Talent we can forget  
that she's one of the best speakers in this 
batch so for sure she's gonna be in the top  
five I remember that last year she had an strategy 
because she surprised us she looked like a winner  
in final night so probably she can deliver another 
strategy or even more better so that makes me  
excited about her first runner up I think is gonna 
be Miss agusan well the first time that I looked  
at her like a month ago I didn't know that she 
was there but along with the events that we have  
seen I have been impressed with what I've seen 
from her extraordinary beauty but also her energy  
is like an winner energy if we judge to pick the 
winner about just the preliminary competition she  
will be the winner because she was the best of the 
preliminary competition in swimsuit competition in  
evening gown I just saw a winner in there I just 
saw someone that could be victorious this next  
May 13th for me Hector miss Universe Philippines 
2023 is Miss Baguio she ate she left no crumbs  
everything about her was really really beautiful 
especially her styling I love that we don't only  
see a gorgeous girl but we see a girl that is 
prepared that she has this team of training that  
are helping her to look at her maximum potential 
I'm looking in a winner someone that you can  
really see and say wow she's just amazing you know 
that everyone wants to look at her everyone wants  
to take a picture with her she just portrays 
that image that I have in my mind of what a  
beauty queen has to be: beautiful intelligent just 
charismatic and nice to people and obviously being  
humble that's something really important 
and I have seen those qualities in her so  
that's the reason why she is my number one right 
now but I know I know that my winner always gets  
first runner up or second runner up we'll see what 
place she's gonna get Miss Baguio I hope that she  
wins the crown, my expectations and my hopes are 
all on her so I hope that she doesn't disappoint  
me I talked a lot it's your moment who is your 
favorite who is your winner for Miss Universe  
Philippines? I can't believe that this experience 
is almost done it has been a pleasure for me let's  
enjoy the final night with so much joy and stop
