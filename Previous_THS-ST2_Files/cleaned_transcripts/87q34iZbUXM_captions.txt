Hi guys, and what is up guys? I hope, all of you will be okay and healthy. today is my second day in Manila.
today, I will be visiting some local places in Manila
and after this, I will do joint vlog with a local from that place where I am visiting for vlogging
with local, we can visit the local life and inner places of that city or country
and here we are with Shilla from the Philippines, and Noman from Pakistan
and Noman bhai is from Sahiwal in Pakistan
He is also a vlogger from Pakistan
so Noman bhai, welcome to the show
Salam = Hello
if you come to Manila then do try Jeepney which is a local mode of transport in Manila
Traffic is very jam in Manila, we got off the jeepney after 10 minutes here in Manila
now, we are going to Saturday Market in Manila
it was very good first experience in Jeepney. it was not too busy because today, it is a weekend.
on weekdays, it's very crowded. in one jeepney, 18 people can sit at a time and it cost 9 Peso per journey
it's a traditional transport in Philippines since World War II times when Americans first brought it here
Saturday Market was closed, so now we have come to Makati Central Square in Manila
What's here? Let's ask Shilla
it is an old place and local place, that's why we are visiting it, let's go inside.
that's it, we are roaming in the local market here
let's show you as well, haven't find anything interesting here, but let's see what happens
it does look like a local place for shopping and looks like things are very cheap here (cheap means low priced)
This market also has a small food street
you can find second hand stuff as well as new stuff here in this market in Manila
That's 4 T-shirts for 100 Pesos only
it's a place for shooting range in this market
if you like shooting range then this is the place for you
inside this market, we can find like shooting range as well as we can buy toy guns(I think so)
it looks like "Toy Guns" to me
after walking for 3 to 4 minutes, we have reached another shopping mall here
we will try local tea here called "Milk Tea" which is basically an Ice Tea but very famous and nice
it costs around 100 Pesos for one glass in Manila
WOW, it's delicious and tastes great.
I am trying "cold tea" for the first time in my life. because we usually drink hot tea in Pakistan/Dubai.
it also has something to eat (Pearls) which is more tasty than the Tea itself.
After drinking tea, now we have to once again take the Jeepney to reach our next destination.
The jeepney is here and we have to sit again in it
What are your feelings bro in this jeepney?
I am used to it, I have been using this for quite a long time here in Manila
it's common here, most of the people use Jeepney and tricycles for daily travel and journeys
I use it every second day for traveling in Manila
I think, there are more jeepneys in Manila than people
we got off one jeepney, and will get board another one to reach our destination (old manila)
in total, we have to use 3 jeepneys from Makati to Old Manila and Intramuros area
we have finally reached Old Manila, we started this journey from Makati and used all local transport jeepney
Usually, traffic is very jam in Manila, but today it was just lightly jam because it's a weekend today in Manila
we used jeepneys 3 times to reach here and in total it cost us 27 Pesos per person one way
but it took 40 minutes to reach here by using jeepney
if you want to see real life in Manila then do use Jeepney and Tricycles
you can also use Grab taxi or any other mode of Transport
but bike is the best option to avoid traffic if you are alone
(Laughing) Shilla is just starting vlogging, so she is a little bit nerves while talking to Camera
Philippines was colonized by Spain 400 years ago
therefore, Spain has left many legacies in the Philippines and some of those legacies are here in Intramuros area
While walking in old Manila, it feels really great, there are old buildings and historical things in this area
now we have come to this Church called "Manila Cathedral" in Old Manila
we have seen many foreign tourists here in this area
in this area, you will find things left from the Spanish era
it was once bombarded in world war 2 by USA and Japan
weather is also very awesome today, so we are really enjoying here, but let's find more
now, we are in Fort Santiago inside (Intramuros) or old Manila
the entry fee is 75 peso per person
we have bought two tickets for ourselves, and Shila is a student here so she got some discount for herself
that's it, we have entered the Fort Santiago.. Horrahha
Now, Shilla will tell you more about this place
Noman, what do you say about this place?
it's smaller than Lahore fort, but I already have visited this place before and I have made video too
There is a museum there
Same info in Urdu as told by Shilla
and so, here is the end of Manila old city tour
That's the fort behind us, and after finishing that, here is the Manila river in front of us
and there are people enjoying the weather here
let me show you this from above
This is the view and system here, the last one
During the day, weather was hotter but now the weather is just awesome here
