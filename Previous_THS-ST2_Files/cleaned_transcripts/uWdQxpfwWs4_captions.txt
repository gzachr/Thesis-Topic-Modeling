good morning from Coron!
today we'll gonna do another tour
we will visit
Malcapuya island
and another two
and.....right away
bulogdos island and banana island
here are a lot of tours and we can't remember all of the island that we will see
the idea is that in Coron, other than tours you can't do anything by day
so we are going on a tour every day
the view in the islands is awesome and here, in the city, is not that great
and we arrived on the first island
it's called Bulogdos
it is one of the most beautiful we ever see until now
we love it
here are some small islands with some greenery and some traces of sand
there are three aligned here
so beautiful
and because here are a lot of tourists, everybody struggles to take a picture there
we sailed for two hours to get here
we thought that we will have more time to visit and relax here
we'll stay here 30-40 minutes and we are sad about this
because we love this place so much
and if you come in Coron we recommend you to take this three tour islands
taking a selfie with everybody now
we met here on the beach
here you don't say "SMILE" but "SMEEELLLL"
this is the second stop - Banana Island
one more to go
here we eat lunch
the food was ok :)
and this island, same as the other one is beautiful
yes
really beautiful
it has palm trees, a place where you can play volleyball
white sand
the water is so clear
turquoise it looks awesome
we'd love to stay a whole day here
this is a leitmotif for us to want to stay where we enjoyed, like Seven Commandos
superb
you don't have to miss this tour
it worth it
dears, we are now on Malcapuya Island
another piece of paradise from the Philippines
kind of forgotten by the world, is hard to get here
lots of tourists here :)
but so beautifull, we could move here
we're thinking seriously to move here :)
there are like 200 beaches that we want to move on :)
and also Malcapuya
the Philippines has some beautiful places
like they call you with the passport to move here :)
move here, come here :)
the filipino people are wonderful and i think that's why we have this feeling on every island
greenery, palm trees, nice sand, nice people, we'd love to move here :)
we are so tired doing all this tours here
and filled with tourists
meanwhile we are looking for a beach to stay all day long
to find some authentic places
here is kinda hard because all the boats are for specific tours
eather way still the most beautiful places are on a tour, not on a private tour
the beautiful ones are for sure included on a tour
and everybody wants to see the accessible beauties in the area
but clearly the beaches that you can see on a private are fulfilling and have a great vibe
authentic Philippines
