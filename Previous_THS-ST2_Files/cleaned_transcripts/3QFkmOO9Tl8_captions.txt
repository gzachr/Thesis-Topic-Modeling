We are the lockwoods and we were traveling 
the world to experience up close and in person all  
the natural wonders and distinct cultures that 
our kids would otherwise see only in textbooks  
and TV unfortunately we've been stuck in the 
states for almost two months and eating almost  
every meal at home and because food culture is 
such a big part of our travel Adventure we're  
all getting a little bit hangry for some of our 
International favorites we're not even sure that  
we can make it another couple of weeks until 
we're back in Southeast Asia but luckily we  
just heard about a relatively new Filipino 
restaurant that's only a few minutes drive  
from our house so of course we had to come 
see for ourselves let's check out Manila Bay
thank you
they just opened early last year and we're 
getting here just before opening on a Tuesday  
they've done a great job with the interior 
design in this huge dining room loving the  
little decorations and Architectural touches all 
over and over on this side they have an in-house  
Bakery and takeaway counter they sell a bunch of 
authentic homemade and imported Filipino favorites  
like these Goldilocks pastries and Magnolia 
ice creams that we'll probably end up having  
for dessert today I mean we'd be here every day 
if it was in walking distance of our house so  
I'm sure local Filipinos love this place I am 
dying for some Filipino food I cannot believe  
haven't been out of the country for two months I 
am itching to get out but we decided to stay in  
town over the summer for the kids because they're 
gonna have their summer break their friends are  
going to have their summer break so they get to 
play a little bit more and have maybe a normal  
summer like they went to Camp oh it's down to the 
wire uh we found out the kids cabins and Brooklyn  
is Aspen colt is coyote dropping them off at Camp 
was an ordeal for me you know how I cry in pretty  
much every single episode no different I was a 
mess so now we just have to find the people who  
are going to take them to their cabins the air 
smells of manure so you know it's gonna be fun  
all right here we are this one is at Aspen so 
this is where Brooklyn's gonna spend the week  
with Christina her counselor and a little gang 
of girls here and then Colts right next door  
like coyote and uh we've got our typical 
Water Works coming from Erin over here
it was so hard to walk away for them I'm just 
gonna miss them I know they're gonna have a  
great time they're gonna have a blast now what 
do we do now we have to get back home because I  
have to do laundry we have to pack for a little 
trip of our own give Phil and I a chance to get  
away to Coronado for a little bit oh my God 
I missed this so much it is Phil and mine's  
favorite place to be but we haven't been back 
for over a year but Summer's over kids are back  
in school and we're ready to get out we need 
those cultural experiences this menu is very  
big very good I found like my favorite appetizer 
in the world and my favorite yum yum in the world  
golden fries toasted in our cinnegan seasonings 
topped with a creamy aioli and green onions what
hard to concentrate with the wrestling competition 
going on over here but this menu really does look  
legit they've got a lot of the staples some things 
that we recognize even though I think most of the  
Filipino food we've had was street food and 
some of these things are unfamiliar to us but  
we're getting some recommendations from the owners 
Benny and may are two of them they're here tonight  
working with us lumpia one of our favorites I 
have lumpia for the first Market the Chinatown  
in Manila so that brings back super memories yeah 
I can confirm this is such a cool little streak  
here that is it looks like a small market and a 
narrow street but we're at New Ping new pohang  
lumpia house now the only late Shawn they have on 
the menu is the leichon Kawali which interestingly  
I don't think we've ever had in the Philippines 
but we have had it in the United States in Miami  
when Erin and I were jumping around trying 
to find good mojito and at first I took a bite  
I thought it was a potato because it has that 
consistency but actually I think it's fried fat  
and it's amazing they also have a summer specials 
menu and honestly I think instead of getting the  
lechon Kawali we'll probably go for the crispy 
Pata because it's more of an unusual dish we've  
never had it before and they don't usually have it 
here this definitely feels like an o-o-e situation  
to me one of everything other than just wanting to 
find a Filipino restaurant I like that it's called  
Manila Bay because we are specifically flying 
into Manila in a few weeks because in case you  
missed our live episode last week we're actually 
going to be using Manila BGC as our part-time  
home base for Asia so we're going to split the 
year between Denver and Manila so when we get  
to Manila we're gonna apartment shop probably 
gonna do that right away and besides the fact  
that it's gonna be a very convenient hub for all 
of our Asian travels we also get to be neighbors  
with our best friends in the entire world the 
Ocampos from momduty Channel if you don't already  
follow them be sure to check them out right here 
they make the best family-friendly travel content  
they are so real and genuine and they are our 
favorite people in the world they're so sweet  
subscribe make sure to subscribe you also might 
see some filled cameos in their episodes gelatinous  
gelatinous gelatinous this is a Filipino lemonade 
basically a kalamasi lemonade well it wouldn't be  
a lemonade it'd be a kalamacy Aid quilt's gonna 
try it first he's like limeade yeah is it because  
it's lemonade with lime Italian you remember 
they're about this big you seem in Asia a lot  
when we're there and so it's calamasi yeah well I 
like that a lot better than lemonade because it's  
not sour it's not too sour that tastes so much 
more like the fruit than lemonade does lemonade  
just tastes like a lemon flavored drink with a lot 
of sugar but it just tastes like you're squeezing  
the what's it called calamasi right into a 
glass it's so good these are cinnigan fries  
and they are fries with a a bunch of cinegangs 
seasonings a creamy aioli sauce and topped with  
some green onion I want this Saucy one because 
I'm really Saucy and so she rhymes with saucy  
salt and spicy mayo mixed together with seasonings 
it's like a spicy mayo but there is a really yummy  
salty taste it's like a little kick to the Salt 
right it has a spicy mayo flavor yeah I don't  
think it's spicy but there's something Tangy about 
like the salt specifically well this is pretty  
much the big daddy right here it's crispy Pata 
which is a complete pork hock deep fried until  
it's super crispy so this is what we're doing 
instead of early chome tonight specifically  
the Lei Chong Kawali that they have on the menu 
I don't even know how to eat this but there's a  
big knife so I'm guessing I just start stabbing 
and cutting away look it doesn't even move like  
that's crispy do you think we ordered enough I 
want to Dive Right into this it's bungus Sig Sig e
no there's no sick it's
and so it's a milk fish that's chopped up at 
boneless deep fried onions different onions  
green onions red onions and it looks and smells 
so so good I could have used a spoon and I love  
how it like it's plated on the fish just 
played open really good because the fish  
is still really really juicy and it's really 
salty too it almost tastes like soy soy sauce I  
I'll have a little piece like a shovel okay and 
then shove it down yourself it's very seasoning  
yeah maybe a little soy sauce oh definitely 
has that same seasoning the french fries had  
okay but let's get back to this Pata because 
I have to see what this is all about can you  
see how that is a hoof is that what you call it 
a hoof yeah a pig hoof all the bones so crispy  
mmm it's getting so crispy it really pulls apart 
pretty easily it's so hot though it's burning  
though it's our house made soy sauce that's 
good all right I gotta get into this big part  
all right if you like crispy skin 
on lechon you would love this  
that's phenomenal this place has carryout and 
delivery also I'm not sure how this would turn  
out I don't even know if they do this thing since 
it's on a special menu they may not include it in  
the delivery I want to get some of this oh yeah 
yeah I'm gonna put it on the skin like a cracker  
it's so crunchy and the pork is really really 
good too hey cool try that pork and then  
try a bite of this tastes like a fat cracker 
okay that's exactly what it is a fat cracker
that's just full of pork meat I had no 
idea I thought it was just gonna be like  
gin and stuff but look at 
that oh my gosh that's a heart
that's like the dark meat of the pork yeah that's 
the best way to eat fish I don't like to work for  
my food so getting a whole grilled fish or a fried 
fish in this case is way too much work for me this  
is perfect because they've done all of it for 
you and it's so easy to eat but that's not at  
all we have more this is what I really wanted 
when I saw it on the menu it's oxtail karikari  
and it has a peanut sauce eggplant and bok choy I 
see karikari on the menus a lot when we're in the  
Philippines and this is the first time I think 
I can remember we've actually had it and I love  
oxtail oh my gosh I thought it was gonna be hard 
to cut like I might need a knife that was really  
easy to get some meat off of it and this is shrimp 
paste our server who's from the Philippines said  
that we take just a little Dot and put it on 
there it's probably going to be pretty salty  
so I'm not gonna do too much mmm peanut sauce is 
really good the oxtail is really yummy too and  
that shrimp paste like it tastes like there's a 
shrimp on it I don't think it's too salty though  
not at all I'm gonna try some of the eggplant 
eggplant's so good is that actually an ox's tail
um even though you just said peanut sauce I wasn't 
expecting peanut sauce hey look a knife yeah as  
we've mentioned in some of our other episodes 
not a lot of restaurants in the Philippines  
actually put knives on the table and apparently 
this is what we were told when we were there  
it goes back to like the days of occupation 
by who was it Japan Spain the Spanish wouldn't  
let them have knives because they might use 
them for weapons did I get that right babe  
what we heard is because the Filipinos were 
such skilled knivesmen so they thought don't  
risk it don't give them any knives not even 
a table knife so instead they learned to eat  
their food with a fork and a spoon I have not 
mastered this yet but there is a technique to  
use your spoon as a knife I'm gonna give this 
bite to Cole he's been waiting for some oxtail  
ooh peanut yeah yum it's like soft very soft 
and of course since this is Filipino Cuisine we  
got tons of white rice which I'm gonna dip in this 
peanut sauce because that'll be phenomenal rice is  
so good for dipping that's why can go through rice 
so easily if I had to choose I would say hands  
down the fish is my favorite it's so good what 
about you yeah the seasoning on it there's some on  
the plate it's so good you know what I think it's 
probably got palomasi that's why it's a bit Tangy  
it was all really good I think for me it's gonna 
be the Pata because it's unusual I haven't had  
that before and it's really so good every part of 
it is either crispy or really tender so it's like  
you get pulled pork and the crispy skin I guess a 
lot like lechon itself but it's time for dessert
all right we'll definitely get one hollow 
hollow and then there's another dessert on  
here that I haven't heard of before but we've 
gotta try that one because it sounds insane  
this is hello Hollow and it means mix there is 
sweet and beans weird Jello thingies ice cream  
shaped ice and whatever the heck those are this 
looks like coconut flakes and this silver here is  
blonde there's also kind of sweet and condensed 
milk at the very bottom but when we were in the  
Philippines and we had Halo Halo they gave us 
a sweetened condensed milk on the side and we  
poured it on top and it almost kind of helped 
everything uh melt and meld together it really  
doesn't matter all that matters is that heat 
it if you don't know what Ube is and of course  
everybody in the Philippines knows but outside 
of the Philippines it's very much like a sweet  
potato and if you've been to Hawaii actually 
Ube is really big in Hawaii also but they also  
have POI we had POI Donuts in our episode 
in Oahu you can check that one out and see  
POI is made from taro root Ube is sweeter 
than Taro is and we've got some little uh  
basically like spring rolled egg rolls that 
are wrapped bananas sweet bananas inside of  
an Eggroll wrapper and then there's powdered 
sugar and honey on the outside might be hot
but this is a little Masterpiece that I'm 
excited about because the description sounds  
phenomenal this is called maize con yellow 
and it is sweet corn it is sweet milk it is  
shaved ice and it's got Corn Flakes cereal 
and then it's topped with a magnolia corn  
cheese ice cream corn as a dessert I think is 
just so underrated I'm excited about this ice  
cream I think that's one of the best ice creams 
I've ever had corn and cheese this is like ice  
cream cereal or corn big lump enough I could 
eat corn for dessert it's so sweet as it is
to get to the milk when we put that 
to end no not quite anymore is that  
a saying can it be a saying now we're gonna 
make a shirt now that says put that to end  
so good sweet sweet ending but we have more sweets 
to show you all right guys do you want something  
from the bakery I love something from the bakery 
all right you can each get one thing from the  
bakery you said one thing right one thing for each 
hand this is winter melon milk tea Mochi and mochi  
is bean paste inside of some rice Paste can also 
have ice cream inside of it but that's more of a  
sugary dessert sort things but this specifically 
has is winter melon milk tea flavored which is  
like Boba except it's more iced tea boa it's like 
icy with tapioca melon milk cheese but these are  
for tomorrow because they've had plenty of 
sugar for one day well that was the perfect  
over until our next trip out of the country 
to the Philippines but that's not where we're  
going next we're actually going on 
a little American holiday in Florida
we're going to a little coastal town called 
Seaside Florida and even though most of you  
probably have never heard of it you may have 
seen it before because it is the actual set  
location for a Jim Carrey movie called The 
Truman Show in the movie It's supposed to be  
this domed Hollywood set it's actually Seaside 
Florida and that's pretty much exactly what it
