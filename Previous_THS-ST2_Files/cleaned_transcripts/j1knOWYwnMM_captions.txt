everything looks the same i'm just blown away 
by how fast it was they said that the elbow  
and the hand are here but i spot something 
that looks like a third item of hercules
did she almost fall she did fall oh 
my god face first on that last hair
hey welcome to our very first 
vlog here in philadelphia  
oh wrong name okay let's turn actually i 
think there we go we're in amman jordan  
used to be called philadelphia by the 
greeks but today it's called the mud
i cannot believe we're here i think 
i've wanted to come to jordan for like  
i don't know like 15 years or something 
since i was so young it really looks the same
i'm just blown away by how vast it was there's so 
many buildings and they go as far as the eye can  
see and they all look the same there's not even 
any bit of variety like you can't tell like you  
know this is more of a recreational area there's 
an office space or residential they all look  
so similar but i was just reading so the kingdom 
of jordan became its own like independent state in  
1946 so it's young 1946 yeah it's young right 
wow yeah what do you think of amman so far  
amazing vast brown busy a lot 
of history so much history
we're at the city down it's so excited yeah it's 
so neat to be up here so the citadel is at the  
top of jabel alcala which the locals don't know it 
as the citadel um but they know it's arabic name  
they use its real name yeah it's arabic name 
jibella kala so that's what we told our driver  
and he knew exactly where to go and it took us to 
the top of the hill we're really glad we took a  
we took a ride up here because that had 
been a lot of steps we were gonna walk
okay the citadel what we understand has basically 
just been like a central sort of city hub  
here in amman uh over many many millennia uh 
so no matter kind of who was running this area  
the pieces of it would be like taken 
and repurposed depending on which empire  
was in control of the city so a lot of like 
these columns things like that would have been  
like just repurposed from a previous temple or 
whatever it would have been i guess when you're  
building a large building's at the top 
of a hill you don't really want to know  
you don't want to bring more bring new 
stuff up to the top so that makes sense
these columns are actually really 
massive they don't look that big  
until you get right up to them and stand beside 
them i don't know i think they look pretty big  
from afar so we are now at hercules temple which 
we understand was built by i think the romans oh  
shoot i'm forgetting i'm pretty sure it's the 
romans it sounds like a must be no greek it  
sounds like a greek thing anyway i was built 
a couple millennia ago but we were promised  
three fingers from the statue of hercules 
and an elbow and we can't find them
i don't know where they i don't know where they 
are oh i found them i think yeah they're up there  
they're so so little they say that the the elbow 
and the hand are here but i spot something that  
looks like a third item of hercules i think that's 
the elbow hercules i don't know what that is  
they don't talk about it on any of 
the signs i don't know very suspicious
so we've left the citadel and we're trying to make 
our way to the amphitheater which is next kind of  
big attraction nearby big tip i think getting 
a cab ride to the top of the citadel and then  
working your way down towards the amphitheater 
is definitely the correct order it would suck to  
start at the bottom go up all these stairs in the 
middle of the day heat yeah and then the heat and  
the sun and the like taxis are pretty inexpensive 
there's uber here so we got an uber definitely  
that's the taxi up walk down and now we're 
here gonna look for some food that's my lunch
it's a very lively city it's so hot it's 
smoking hot right now not a cloud in the sky
welcome oh thank you
okay we're just walking around and people are 
so friendly so number one a random shopkeeper  
saw us come by and he just gave us just 
walking past the shop we're walking into  
shop he just gave us pieces of candy and then 
another hike came but another truck came by  
and now like waved from us to the 
truck saying it gave us a heart window
so kind dear
oh
okay jordanian people are super nice the 
stranger saying welcome to our country i  
guess we must look like tourists do you 
think one of the shopkeepers just said  
it's my birthday you should buy something i 
think that's covered that is pretty clever
today we're keeping lunch very 
simple very easy very quick  
what do you think it's called sandwich meat 
sandwich i don't know let's take a bite
i don't even know what kind of we 
will take it for just two dollars  
that was nice very quick lunch very affordable 
too it was only a couple dollars yep and uh not  
stuffed well i'm not stuffed nicole stuff good 
thing uh i'm not that stuffed anyways because  
uh next up on our list is the amphitheater and i 
know there's a lot of steps involved in that so
i think there's a bunch of 
locals here like playing  
you know yeah kids playing soccer balls all 
over the place looks like people just hang  
out or maybe like maybe it's still used kind of 
like a just a hangout area communal area right  
it's a beautiful open space it's kind of cool i 
feel like it's more like a playground than it is  
like a ancient ruin of anything it feels like 
a local park yeah like a little plaza in the  
middle of a city i really like it there's people 
playing soccer skateboarding yeah it's really nice
i give you this
thank you so much thank you so much 
really nice really appreciate it when  
you know people kind of let you go after the 
first note you know it's really really nice  
yeah happy to hear your pitch that was love 
for the no to be accepted so that's always nice  
that was the case in turkey um people are really 
kind and so far here in jordan when you say no  
they're they don't push too hard we had one mostly 
we had one earlier like we're really really fine
did she almost fall she did fall from where ouch 
just two stairs up three stairs up three stairs
i didn't see it i heard it though oh 
my god face first on that last stair  
ouch oh that hurts my brain just 
like it hurts she seems okay
so we're the amphitheater and it seems very 
similar to many amphitheaters we've been to  
except that all the locals are here except for the 
fact that everybody's here is what year this is  
yeah it's so cool it might be some sort of 
ancient ruin at some point but today it's  
just a place where everyone's having lunch and 
hanging out it's still used yeah it's so nice  
it's not just like a big tooth attraction 
totally like definitely getting used still
so the best part of people watching right now 
so far is that when you see the tourists come in  
they come in they're looking around like 
what is going on here they're expecting like  
some sort of ancient ruin and probably some 
information tablets and things like that and  
actually it's like a street park 
community area everyone's just  
hanging out playing soccer or something 
and they're just they're so confused
they're dancing on let's head out of here
all right we are i think gonna end 
our day here we're just walking along  
rainbow street which is a very touristy area yeah 
it's very very rainbowy plus you can see above us  
yeah full of like cafes and shops and i managed 
to get some more clothes which is always good  
we're just going to spend the rest of our evening 
walking around enjoying jordan it's our first time  
so thanks for walking around with us yeah and
so friendly anyways we're gonna keep walking 
and uh end our day here and our day here yes  
and the next one we'll see you 
for some jordanian street food  
we're excited hungry already 
okay thanks for watching  
see you next one tan color yeah and they're 
all very similar looking so you have the sea of  
jordan buildings as a sort of a central location 
for all the different what do you call that
i think that's as good as it's getting 
today folks oh gosh i don't want to call hey
you
