- Dun dun dun dun!
This is my moment 
of truth right here.
- Oh my God!
It's a whole bird!
- (PvF) Street food is an 
essential part
of experiencing a new destination
and its diverse culture,
and today we're trying 
some Filipino street food.
- Ooh.
- Ooh!
- Oh, that sounds good!
- Fire!
- Yay!
- Woo! (laughs)
- (PvF) Pretty much all street food
is served with an array 
of sauces and sides,
so you know, we've got
a platter of vinegars,
chilies and sauces for 
you to use.
- Okay.
- Alright.
- They look like
little dough balls.
- Oh.
- Is this fish heads?
- Oh, I thought that was
an egg. (laughs)
- Oh, it might be an egg.
- This is the real streets, bro.
- Okay, quail eggs,
so fried quail eggs.
- Quail egg!
- Quail egg.
- With flour.
- Flour.
- Fried quail eggs.
- That sounds good.
- That does sound fire.
- I love these like
white guy tourists
making these videos.
- He's eating it with...
- This video is giving culture.
- Oh God, alright.
- So this is what it is though.
- (PvF) Kwek kwek is a tempura-like
Filipino street food
made by deep frying orange batter
covered hard boiled eggs.
- I'm gonna go ahead
and try it
without the sweet and sour sauce.
- Gonna do one nakey,
and then do the sauces.
- (PvF) You said nakey.
- Oh my God, this is good.
- Is it?
- It's already like
a hard boiled egg.
- It's just a hard boiled egg fried.
- Mm-hmm.
- Alright, first off,
I've never had...
- That was great.
- A fried quail egg, and it's fire!
- Ooh, this is really good.
- This is really good.
- It's not horrible,
I just don't like boiled eggs.
It might be the texture.
- That sweet and sour sauce is good.
I'm taking it home.
(Kenneth laughs)
- I would eat it again.
- I'm Filipina, they can't 
come for me.
- And this is really good.
- Man's finished the entire thing.
- I know.
- Look how populated it is.
- Let's see some more
white guys in the Philippines.
(Anais laughs)
- Bro, that market
looks so cool.
- Ooh!
- (man) It's chicken intestines.
- Did he just say chicken intestines?
(Dan laughs)
- How big can they be?
I feel like chickens are little small.
- Ah, okay, I've seen this!
I've seen this before!
I haven't tried it.
- Whoa, it looks like an intestine.
(laughs) This is funny.
- It kinda looks like 
a lollipop. (laughs)
- Mm-hmm.
- It's like a tube of chicken.
- I bet it's just gonna
taste like chicken.
- I would assume
it's pretty chewy.
- Beautiful.
Wait, what's this one?
- What is this one?
- Is this what you squeezed
out of the intestines?
- Dun dun dun dun!
This is my moment of truth right here.
- (PvF) Grilled skewered meats
are extremely popular 
in the Philippines,
and often called
Pinoy barbecue.
Isaw, or grilled intestines
is one of the most sought after dishes
at street markets.
- And I know why.
- It's good?
- It's good!
- (PvF) We also have some 
barbecue chicken for you.
- Yum, I love barbecue chicken.
- Oh, okay.
- (laughs) Are you smelling
some intestinal...
- (laughs) It smells like
I'm walking past the flamingo exhibit.
- Clink. (laughs)
- Ah! (laughs)
It followed me.
- Bro, these are good.
Hell yeah.
- It almost tastes like sausage
more than chicken.
- It's like a hot dog.
- Not the flavor,
but the texture.
- It kinda tastes like
mini sausages.
- It has that smoky,
like grilled flavor.
- Like barbecue.
- Yeah!
- This was inside a chicken.
(laughs)
- So was this!
- That's why, I know, 
but all I keep thinking about
is how this was literally
wrapped up,
in the way it is now!
- I think just the fact that
you know it's chicken intestine
makes it weird.
- Okay, if I'm being honest,
it tasted like carne asada.
- Have you ever thought like
what if an alien came down to Earth,
killed us, and then was doing
food review videos of our intestines?
- Oh my God.
- I think any food that has
like a valve at the end of it
is a little off-putting.
- Yeah, this is my first time,
but not my last.
- What is this?
- I don't know, I love
the street vibes there, going on.
- Oh, lumpia, okay.
- Lumpia?
- I'm not sure what this is.
- Lumpia?
- Oh, lumpia?
Oh bro, this is gonna be fire.
- This looks different.
- The ones I've had have been
more like deep-fried.
- Yo!
- Oh!
- It's like a spring roll.
- Yeah!
- This looks more like
a burrito.
(both laugh)
- These look fire!
- (PvF) So this dish is called
Lumpiang Ubod,
and it's known as the 
heart of palm spring roll.
It consists of julienne ubod,
of heart of palm,
with various meats
and vegetable in a thin egg crepe.
- Ooh.
- Mmm.
- An egg crepe?
- Alright.
- I caught about half of that.
- I don't know how to 
eat this though exactly. (laughs)
- Yeah, dig in, my friend.
- I have never tried this before.
- That is good.
- It's good?
- Mm-hmm!
- Say no more.
- Saucy.
- This is pretty good.
- Mm-hmm.
- It tastes like a type of salad,
just wrapped up.
- Oh, it's a little spicy.
Got a kick.
- Very fresh.
- I really like the sauce.
- I don't know how
I feel about this.
- I would love if it was like
dipped, or fried.
- The aftertaste is a little fishy
for my tastes.
- Probably won't take it first date.
- No, it's a messy first date
kinda meal.
- I will say it's like
a healthy option of a street food,
'cause a lot of the street foods
are like super greasy and oily.
- (PvF) Now we're moving on
to one of the most
controversial street foods ever.
- Oh, I know what this is.
I don't know how you're
gonna feel about this one.
I don't know how I feel
about this one. (laughs)
- I'm a soldier.
- (screams) Do you know
what this is?
- No.
- It's an egg.
- Ah, it's more than the egg.
(laughs)
- They're like, 
actually developed, right?
- Mm-hmm.
- Dude, my stepdad offered me
$100 to try it,
and I didn't even try it.
- Oh!
- So I wanted to try it, yeah.
- You want to try it?
You're excited about this?
My heart is racing right now.
- No way.
- Whoa!
- You can see its feathers.
- Dang, that little baby chick
didn't get a chance.
- Oh my gosh.
- I'm palpitating.
My heart is not well right now.
- This is scary.
- This egg must be gigantic
in like person, bro.
- Yeah, I wanna try it,
but I don't think I'm gonna like it.
- I'm kinda nervous.
- I'm confident right now, bro,
but I don't know if I'm ready.
- They're big!
- Ladies first. (laughs)
- Oh, it's warm.
- It's warm.
- (PvF) So balut is a fertilized 
egg embryo that is boiled.
- Ah! (laughs)
- (PvF) Yeah, then eaten 
from the shell.
It's very commonly sold
as street food,
and it's considered a delicacy
in Southeast Asian countries.
- That man made it look so easy.
He just like...
- Yeah!
- Real fast.
- (growls) Mike Tyson!
- Ooh, it's wet,
she's very wet.
- It's like a hard boiled
egg in the morning.
- Yum.
- Except it's a duck.
- Oh my goodness.
Am I about to drink this?
(Jayka slurps)
- Mine, wait.
- That was really not 
that bad, actually.
- Is it not?
- Okay, it tastes like egg soup.
- Egg soup?
- Oh my goodness.
(Jayka slurps)
- It's good!
- Whoa, look at that.
(laughs) That's insane.
- Yeah.
- I'm not gonna lie,
this is not for the faint.
- I don't think this is
even for me, bro.
- Oh my God!
It's a whole bird!
- It's good.
I can see why people eat it.
- Oh my God.
- The yolk is really creamy.
(Jayka screams)
(Dan laughs)
(Anais screams)
- Oh my gosh.
- Yep.
- Dude, it's a whole bird,
and you're supposed to eat this.
- That's so cool.
It's like a science experiment 
at the same time.
- Hi chicka, I love you!
(laughs)
- (laughs) I'm kidding.
Nah, that's not gonna happen.
- Let me kiss it!
(both laugh)
- I pulled off the leg.
- Well now I gotta do it.
- Now it tastes like chicken.
- It's actually not bad, bro.
- Okay.
- You got it, you got it!
Does it have a crunchy taste?
- I'm doing c-section!
(Dan laughs)
Mwah, cheers!
- Cheers!
- You know what? 
Actually,
I expected it to be
way worse.
- That's the funniest [censored]
I've seen, bro. (laughs)
- I think I felt like more softer.
- It was like soft meat.
- I thought you were a goner,
and then you just flipped
the script, like...
- (laughs) No, it took me a second.
- Honestly, it tastes like
a boiled egg.
- I'm like actually really glad
that I tried this though.
I'm still going.
- Banana!
- Bananas?
(both gasp)
- I've seen this!
- What is this?
- It looks like rice paper.
- Ooh!
- Turon is so delicious.
- I've seen this.
Wait, I'm excited.
- This looks good.
- Yeah, I think this 
is gonna be good.
- I like that sauce.
- Mmm, anything fried.
- And they're doing this
on the street, bro.
- Oh, I'm eating all of these.
- So good.
- First off, this actually 
smells good.
- This looks good.
- (laughs) She didn't let...
- Oops.
- (PvF) So bananas, jackfruit,
sweet potatoes and coconut
are some common fillings
for sweet fried 
spring rolls called turon,
and today we have an ube
turon for you to try.
Ube is a purple yam
originally from the Philippines,
and it's a very popular ingredient
for both its color 
and light, sweet flavor.
(turon crunches)
- Out of everything so far,
this is my favorite.
- That's good!
- Mmm, mmm, mm.
- Mm-hmm.
- It kinda tastes like a pie.
- Very sticky.
- I'm a fan.
- I like the crispiness.
- This is like a secret treasure.
- Mmm.
- This is so bomb.
- This is top tier.
- 10 out of 10!
- Perfect, 10 out of 10.
- (man) This is buko pandan, 
it's green.
- Buko pandan.
- Mm-hmm.
- (man) I'm not sure where
the green comes from.
- Ooh.
- (man) ...minty, vanilla taste.
- I like the sound of minty vanilla.
- Okay.
- Whoa.
- Oh, the consistency was not
what I was expecting.
- It looks like healthy ice cream
or something.
- Yeah, yeah, it looks like yogurt.
- (man) That is so surprising.
- Okay.
- He's surprised.
- He's surprised.
- I'm excited.
- Wait, that's so adorable.
- Mmm, okay.
- (PvF) Buko pandan is a very 
popular Filipino dessert
made using young coconut,
pandan leaves, and sago pearls.
It has a unique 
and delicious flavor.
- It looks very unique.
- Oh my God, this is good!
- It's super interesting.
- This is so odd,
but it's like yummy.
- Oh, this is really good.
It's very sweet.
- Very sweet.
- And the little like 
Jell-O part is so good.
- Yeah, I love the texture.
- I loved the taste,
I hated how it felt in my mouth.
- This is good bro.
And I'm not usually a mint person.
- This has a unique flavor.
- It really does.
- Yeah.
- And it's a little minty,
and a little vanilla-y.
- Vanilla, banana,
and green.
- This is really good.
There's a lot of good stuff out there.
- Yeah.
- Some things I will
try to forget,
and some things I will
try to remember to get.
- Like, I need to get out more.
