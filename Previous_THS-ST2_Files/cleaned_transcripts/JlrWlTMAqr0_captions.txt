The Ambassador of the Philippines to
Norway, her excellency Jocelyn Batoon
Garcia
was so kind to spend a day with us in
Oslo let's watch this...
Okay let's go John! Let's go for a long
walk
you know the story of this uh finger. No.
Shoots!
So you teach me...
What do you... What have you learned?
The swedish king decided that he wanted
to determine
uh where he is going to put his capital
in Norway. He said this is the spot
where he is going to
build his capital
So where are we going now? Let's go to
the old
part of Oslo. I am reminded of this place
of Intramuros so that is why i want to
bring you there
okay let's go to Akerhus
that's the old port as you know
Akershus Festning
Yes, because that's an area that seems
as i said, it it really reminds me of
Intramuros
Before coming to norway, Amba, have you
been to norway before?
i came to Norway once before i came here
on a mission but I came during the
height of winter so it was very very
cold
but i decided that i was going to see
the Akershus Festning.
What do you think is the biggest
difference of Norway to the
Philippines
in many ways Norway and the Philippines
are very similar.
There are many islands, many mountains
many waters waterways
but Norway is more prosperous because of
its oil.
We don't have that much oil we have only
Well..not yet
we haven't discovered it yet. It is also
trying to develop its agriculture
except of course the agricultural land
area in Norway because of the seasons is
much less
we are still in the Philippines
basically an agricultural country
although more than 50 percent
of our exports are actually
no they're not agriculture they are, people...
no most of them are spare parts
okay, manufactured products so contrary
to the
general impression that we export mostly
agricultural products actually no
about 51 of our exports
are industrial products
mostly spare parts of various machinery
and things like that we do however
export
also agricultural products like
to Norway
we export carrageenan you know the
seaweeds
that become part of all your cosmetic
products. 
So we export that to Norway?  We export that
to Norway. Are there other things that we
export to Norway?
Some fishery products
but our balance of trade
is in favor of Norway.
They export a lot of salmon
and cod but mostly salmon
products and a few other industrial
products.The cost of salmon
in the Philippines is about the same
or if not a little cheaper than the cost
here
partly because labor in the Philippines
is cheaper
and that is actually our advantage
and that's why we encourage investments
to the Philippines
because it's much cheaper despite the
fact that we have
very very technically proficient
workers and laborers and managers.
They get paid lower rates than
in Norway partly because
as you know the standard of living here
is much higher
therefore it is more costly
also your taxes are very high.
Before the opening of the Philippine
Embassy in Stockholm and Philippine
Embassy in Copenhagen,
you've been the Ambassador of the whole
of nordics
Which country are we more close with? has better ties with?
Actually our ties with the Nordic
countries are quite
good. We have had diplomatic relations
since the 1940s with all of them
We opened the diplomatic posts first in
Sweden,
in Stockholm and then
we opened in Oslo
and later in Helsinki but when
times we became a little difficult
Sweden closed its post
and we, like them,
were forced to close our
two embassies and we kept our embassy
in Norway. But with the situation
having improved financially for us,
we are now happy to say that
in January of 2019
we were able to open a post in
Copenhagen and in may 15
this year we opened a post in Stockholm
and
Finland is about to open its
embassy this year. Really? okay!
in terms of relations we've had very
good relations with...
with all the Nordic countries and
with Norway we have
special interests because of
the 25 000 seafarers
on board norwegian vessels
either flagged or owned by Norwegians
so that's 25 000. That's about 10
percent of the
world seafaring community.
They are also very good at
cooperating with us
in terms of our
peace building mechanisms.
They have been supporting our
peace initiatives with the CPP-NPA
for quite a while. They're also
supporting
the Bangsamoro
program of the government and of course
they had been
part of the international monitoring
mechanism for peace with the muslims
so we've maintained very good
relations actually with all countries
So you know if you look out there it's
like
looking out from
Fort Santiago into Manila Bay
of course you first see Pasig and then a
little beyond
so there is a certain similarity
and that's one of the reasons why I like
to come to walk
in Akershus Fortress  because it reminds me of
home.
I'd like to have a look and show you
the Opera house
and how it reminds me of
the CCP.  Okay. CCP okay. Yes! the Cultural
Center of the Philippines
John, have a look at that beautiful
structure.
That's the iconic
modern building in Oslo.
Doesn't it remind you of the time when
the Cultural Center of the Philippines
was the
sole structure on Manila Bay
when it dominated like a modern,
a very contemporary architecture
Urban renewal is another area that is
of great concern for us in Manila
There is a new city we call
the Global City. It's actually the old
Fort Bonifacio which has been developed
and somehow looks or resembles
this area
I hope one of these days you can go and
visit
And if you walk down Manila Bay
you will find a gentleman's
sculpture. He's seated.
He was the former mayor of
Manila -  Mayor Lacson.
of course they don't look anywhere near
like each other
but there is a bronze statue of a
gentleman
also sitting down but that particular
one looks
out to the sea
I am now in front of the Stortinget, the
Norwegian parliament
Norway has a constitutional monarchy
with his majesty King Harald V
as the king and head of state.
It has a prime minister Madame Erna
Solberg,
and there are 169 members
of parliament who meet in this
iconic building.
We have now reached the end of our
nice long walk. We end
at the palace of his Majesty, King Harald V
This is where all ambassadors like me
present
our credentials to his majesty.
This will also be the last
place where I will be visiting
when I say and bid
my farewells to his majesty.
I hope you enjoyed our walk today.
If you like that video, please give it a
thumbs up and I will surely appreciate
it
