is the best pineapple i've 
ever had it's been really good  
starting in el nido because we've been really 
run down from staying in cities a lot just  
wanted to get back to that island life and i 
feel like this is the perfect place to do that
i see my past
like
we're digital nomads currently traveling the 
world in search of somewhere we can call our  
forever home we just arrived in the philippines a 
few days ago and made our way to a popular beach  
town called el nido on palawan island where we 
plan on seeing if we can live here long term uh
no someone else did yes
i thought it was you  
my
free
you left me
you left me
so we came to the philippines because we 
were looking to sort of escape the big cities  
we're kind of on the hunt right 
now for an island we can just relax  
on really happy that we've started here 
it's pretty dreamy even though it's  
been raining almost the whole time we've been here 
it's pretty amazing still like a tropical paradise
you
oh
so we started our trip in el nido because 
the palawan province is somewhere that we  
got recommended a lot thanks to a lot of our 
instagram followers who reached out and dm'd  
us with recommendations they suggested if we're 
going to come to palawan we need to come to el  
nido and it was also fairly easy getting here 
from manila you can either take a boat which  
takes a long time or you can fly to porto 
princessa and then get a bus which is what  
we did we're really keen on spending much time 
in manila just because we've been in cities for  
two weeks straight we needed to get 
to the island so far it's pretty good  
we just got probably the freshest 
pineapple i've ever had in my life
it's so sweet it's so good oh my god it 
was two dollars for the whole pineapple  
it's delicious he cut it up fresh right in 
front of us he's awesome even though it has  
been raining pretty much the whole time we've 
been here it's still been very dreamy and magical  
the rain deserves some love too even though we 
do miss the sun a little bit the only downside  
at the moment that we've been having trouble with 
is finding affordable accommodation in el nido  
and actually the thing we were most worried about 
coming here was that the wi-fi was going to be bad  
because we saw a lot of reviews on because of all 
the cliffs in the mountains and stuff around el  
nido makes service and wi-fi pretty bad but it's 
actually been pretty good since we've been here  
this is the best pineapple i've ever had it's been 
really good starting in el nido because we've been  
really run down from staying in cities a lot just 
wanted to get back to that island life and i feel  
like this is the perfect place to do that um it 
is a little bit touristy but i guess not too bad  
at the moment maybe because it is rainy season 
so maybe it is a better time to come the rain is  
actually supposed to clear up in the next couple 
of days so hopefully we'll be able to see it  
in a different sort of light we're pretty happy 
here at the moment can't complain philippines has  
always been on our list of places to go basically 
because there's so many different islands for you  
to check out and just feels really good 
to be back to island life again so far  
my impressions of the philippines it's almost like 
being in central america because of the american  
and spanish influence and they drive on the right 
hand side um yeah it just feels like almost like  
you could be in somewhere in central america 
instead of asia it's quite strange but i like it  
we love the filipino people we think they might be 
the most friendly and happiest people we've ever  
met they've been so kind and they're always waving 
at us and saying hello and uh we've just felt yeah  
really welcomed since we've been here so el nido 
is one of the most popular tourist destinations  
in the philippines mainly because of the diving 
and snorkeling here there's so many different  
islands and beaches you can go to there's 
some pretty standardized island hopping tours  
you'll see these tour shops offering guided tours 
pretty much everywhere um there's four tours to  
choose from because of the weather we're not sure 
if we're going to be able to make it on one of the  
island hopping tours but it's also a popular 
place to go kayaking you can go to a lot of  
secluded beaches from kayaks uh today we've 
just chosen to rent a bike and visit a couple  
of different beaches so we were just uh mary 
magmeg beach and we've just come down here  
to leo beach which is right near the airport 
and it's really nice here there's restaurants  
lining up the beach just need this cloud cover 
to lift a little bit i mean i really like this  
beach because there's free beach chairs that you 
can use which is nice so you'd have to lay in the  
sand one other thing to note is that the atms here 
often run out of money i had that problem twice  
now i had to go to like four different atms so 
luckily there's a few of them around but don't be  
surprised if a lot of them run out of money it's 
actually surprisingly busy here i thought it would  
be a lot quieter there's a lot of tourists here 
and most of the hotels are pretty heavily booked
one thing we've definitely noticed since being 
in philippines is food's really cheap like  
even if we go to a nice sort of touristy style 
western restaurant you're still gonna get a meal  
under ten dollars um which is a bit different 
to where we've been i'm yet to figure out though  
what the filipino traditional food is i think 
it might be barbecue pork but if anyone knows  
let us know in the comments because i want 
to try it it looked like a bit of a wet rat
but that was delicious so far 
the seafood in el nido has been  
incredible it's been my favorite thing to 
eat so far also look at sweet bowls as well
it's all the same
we just finished lunch at a place called happiness 
beach bar one of the things i really like about  
el nido so far is the abundance of healthy food 
options that are here that are super affordable  
as well huge bonus for us unfortunately right now 
we need to head to the doctor because poor lloyd  
has an ear infection i haven't been able to hear 
anything out of this side for like five days now  
and starting to bother me it's getting 
a bit frustrating trying to talk to him  
i feel okay apart from that but yeah i 
mean i get it yeah so the only way to get  
around is in one of these tricycles 
we call it a tuk-tuk still but yeah  
it's the only way to get around and 
i'll need to find us no no doctor
how'd you go i could hear again i finally 
went to the doctor after five days  
yeah i was being a bit stubborn i thought you 
have a doctor phobia i have a doctor phobia  
and it's like a last resort because i thought 
it was probably just from our lifestyle and  
inflammation and lack of sleep and if i got some 
sleep and got healthy again it would go away but  
we caught up with sleep and we've been 
really healthy and my ear was still  
completely blocked so today i said i'm just gonna 
go to the doctor and he flushed it straight out  
i feel like a new man i can't wait to 
talk to you again for what five days
good thing to note i guess if anything goes wrong 
because a lot of these islands don't actually have  
hospitals or doctors at them so el nido has 
actually quite a few options for the doctor  
here which is great and it's a 
sunday and we got straight in um  
i don't think it's too expensive either 
yeah maybe like maybe fifty dollars 50.
uh
um
so it wasn't the most relaxing ride i've ever had 
to yoga now those tricycles are really loud i need  
a bigger engine in those bikes they struggle up 
the hill but they cheat and they go everywhere  
and we got here on time so one thing i've noticed 
though is um when i show them a place to go on the  
map they don't want to use the maps they want to 
figure out where it is and there's this back and  
forth we go with like they ask me for directions 
and i'm like just you can just hold the phone  
man and use the map it's fine like i'll direct 
you that um they don't trust it seems to freak  
them out a little bit i think they know the whole 
island so when i show them a place like this where  
they've never been i don't like it but we're 
just about to do a half a class we're not sure  
how long it is we don't really know anything 
about this when would you like to argue class  
bali yeah i haven't been in the studio since bali 
so it feels pretty good to be back in the studio  
and i'm not going that long again without it so 
at the moment because el nido is quite um quiet  
they only have classes tuesdays and thursdays 
at 9 00 a.m and it's half the classes so we  
we don't know how much it is yet it was we walked 
in and um she thought it was the wrong day she  
thought it was monday and then we thought we had 
the wrong day too we weren't sure we don't know  
what day it is we'll see how we go it's good to 
be out in a fresh air doing a class though yes
yoga was really good it's exactly what i needed 
i'm a bit bummed that it's only two times a week  
and that's the only place that's open in el nido 
at the moment just because they're still sort of  
like reopening from kobe but it was still really 
nice and we were the only ones in there which is  
good that's about ten dollars each which is pretty 
standard for a yoga drop in the room itself was  
quite small so not many people could fit in it but 
i it was just so good to be back in the class and  
have someone else telling me what to do so i could 
just switch off fully yeah i'm never gonna go that  
long without going to a class again it's really 
important to me all right guys thank you so much
