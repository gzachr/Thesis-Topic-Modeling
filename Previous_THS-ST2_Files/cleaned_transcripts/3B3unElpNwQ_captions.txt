Hello
Hello my Hyunee-bees, it's your girl Hyunee and today I'm gonna be eating filipino pancit canton, so let's dig in cuz I'm so hungryy
I hope I said that right
So this is my first time trying this, the cooking style is the same as indomie goreng
so
today I cooked six
Yeah
These are dry noodles. I had to look up pictures on Google to see how to make them
And they had shrimp, and this green bean kind of stuff so I added it
Mmm. Let's try the noodles
It doesn't look spicy to me
But who knows, it could have a little kick
You know it's really not that spicy, but
It has a little bit of the spicy kick to it
It has those chili flakes in them
And it tastes a lot like the indomie goreng I would have to say
Look those tiny shrimp
So I've been getting a few comments saying
Hyunee, you never reply to my comments anymore
unsubscribe
I've actually gotten a few comments like that, and
Honestly, I'm so sorry
But it's really difficult to
comment back every single comment that I get
I do try my best to comment as much as I can
But sometimes
people tend to forget that
youtubers and celebrities have a life of their own other than YouTube and TV
And I hope you guys understand that and don't take it personally, so Cheers!
Come back, come back
But yeah, I just wanted to let you guys know to not take it personally
I love you guys all equally and I love you guys so so so much
And I hope you guys all know that, I appreciate your love and support each and every single one of you
Mmm
I actually really like this
So a lot of you guys actually thanked me for introducing you guys to new foods
but I thank you guys for introducing me to new foods because I
Would have never tried this or Indomie goreng if it wasn't for you guys
so
Thank you
Have some veggies
And my egg, let's eat one or half
Hmm
The one thing about dry noodles it gets dried too quick look at that
It's turning into cardboard
All the sauce is on the bottom
Do you guys like my new little plate, this is actually a cake holder, but I got it because it's pink
So I wanted to ask you guys have you guys seen memes that say
If your girlfriend is mad at you just feed her some food
And she'll forget all about it and be happy, I've seen those memes everywhere
Are you guys those type of girls? as much as I love food, I'm not that type of girl
It's I'm mad at you. We have to talk about it first before we go eat
Or if we're eating I would lose my appetite
Yep Hyunee lose appetite
No, I don't want to eat
I think it's kind of wrong
For guys to think that way, because some guys really think like they can do something wrong and then just feed their
Girlfriends food and everything will be okay, No
That's not how it is
So
Let me tell you guys a story
Remember that X the pumpkin face X
Just making those little laughs like spongebob
and you know sometimes those laughs it gets to you and especially they're making if they're making fun of you too
Fire fire
One time
It was so bad
To the point where it was a restaurant where the tables were really close together
and so
Whatever the table next to you they're saying
You could hear right?
and so
I was already mad because he was making fun of me, and so when we got sat at the table, I didn't feel like eating right
Until he said sorry or something like that
but
We were both pretty prideful, and he's really prideful so he never really apologized
Low and behold things escalated
To the point where table next to us was like hey, we're trying this drink like do you want to try it
Because they could feel the tension in the air. You know? he liked to push my button
Girls don't let the guys get away with whatever they did wrong over food
I guess you could say I'm pretty stubborn
But it's because I don't want my boyfriend to keep doing that
you know
If you let it go
Then they're gonna keep doing it
These are so cute you
They don't know they're egg
It Cheers
Where have you been all my life?
A big, thank you to those of you guys who recommended it
Honestly though, this was not spicy for me at all. I wish it was a little bit spicier
Egg
Transfer each each each... last bite!
