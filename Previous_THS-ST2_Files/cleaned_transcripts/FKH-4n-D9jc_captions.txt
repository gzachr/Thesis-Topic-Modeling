salty enough, and tasty
this is nice
taste like soy sauce fried noodles in korea
-yes yes
i think i will eat two pack at once
-i need three packs
one pack is too small 
-right
three packs will be nice
ok
original flavor. really good
little bit basic. cuz its original flavor
yummy but not the best. maybe
just yummy and plain. i think
but i think many koreans will like it
i think its very nice i want to stack it up 
me too
yummy and easy to eat
good to eat a lot at once
and next
what is
-sweet n spicy
lets try it
the color is darker than original
korean like spicy , i am looking forward to it
amount is amall
but lets try it
cute spicy
(not spicy)
not spicy at all
-just sweet
-yes
really just sweet
-i think so
original flavor is better
-me too
but
has a strong flavor than original
is it?
cuz it is sweet
i think soy sauce flavor of original is better
guys u have to pick the best one
so remember this taste
ok
why did i put my plate over there?
-stupid?
no
hey dude why did you say that?
(smith's finger : xxx xxx)
hey subs are watching now
- i did'nt do anything
peaceful kim n lee
(hit)
at first i think like this
"not sweet n spicy. just sweet"
but it was delicious
original , sweet n spicy
both are nice but
original = good to eat a lot at once
sweet n spicy = too sweet, hard to eat a lot at once
mixing these two will be nice
-is it?
i think it is just "sweet flavor" too
yummy but little bit plain
-anyway it was nice
and next chili mansi??
chili mansi
lets try it
i don't need this plate maybe
lets go cheers
sour scent!
-right
대박(awesome)
this is
not bad. calamansi flavor is not too strong
strong calamansi flavor = not suitable
i think
this sour taste is similar with oishi prawn cracker
i think so
combi of fruit n ramen?
interesting
sour taste increased my appetite . yummy
i wanna eat next one (calamansi flavor)
and little bit spicy
-yes
uhm chili mansi. it is nice
all kind of pancit canton are yummy
nice
(clap)
???
i ate quickly so got stuck in my throat
in summary sour taste increased my appetite. 
so it was nice
more spicy than sweet n spicy flavor
and it was yummy
calamansi scent was suitable than i thought
next one calamansi flavor
we like spicy food, so (extra hot chili )is last one
let's try this first
looking forward to it
wow strong sour scent
-wow
wait a sec. . (memories of lime mukbang)
-it looks delicious
lets go
look at hooney's face
are u okay?
-not sour that much
strong yeah
but yummy
strong sour taste
but nice harmony
yeah it is strong
ramyeon  & fruit? i think it is unique
-it's hard to find something like this in korea
by the way
Not familiar , but nice harmony
all delicious
I thought it will be not good
because i thought fruit and ramen would be not go well together
but i was wrong . it really nice
insane
i think it was not good. because of strong scent
wasn't feels like eating ramen
-ah is it?
things happen too.
i was worried that the fruit taste would be strong. but it was delicious
-me too
i thought like this 
"calamansi n korean ramen" i wanna make & try it
wow nice
calamansi or lime
n
korean ramen
it will be nice
-ok. last one
great name. extra hot chili
extra?
-koreans love spicy flavor
-lets go
i m not good at spicy foods
scent is
-little bit spicy?
try it
there is chili inside
extra = cute???
maybe..
spicy level= korean mild ramen
yes not spicy at all
btw its yummy
-i agree but not spicy
package look scary
but tastes mild
in korea, it seems to be easy to eat for all ages
thats what i m saying
ok then
so how was it?
all delicious
-what is your best one?
my favorite is
original 
-really?
other ramens have a strong character
so it seems difficult to eat often
i can eat original flavor a lot. even if its stacked in a box
as you know korean ramen is yummy.
but it was as delicious as koeran ramen
and it has exotic taste
so i ate it more deliciously
my favorite one is
chili mansi flavor
the sour taste make me eat more
my favorite one is 
chili mansi n extra hot chili 
and i want to mix it
i think its combi will be nice
all delicious but there are pros and cons
because of strong character
if i eat different flavor every day.  it would be nice
how was it? nice?
yes nice
dude
hehe i was surprised
see  you next time with better video guys
Let's kim and lee it!
