My hay fever is so bad, non stop sniffling.
today is warm, it's good
and I wore long sleeves
but when you're in the shade, it's a bit cold because the wind is a bit cold.
let's have dinner. What do you guys want for dinner?
I fell asleep.
I always fall asleep in car, during drives.
Right Chris?
I like this.
We both got full by sharing one serve

I ordered this a long time ago on ebay, and it just arrived today

Thank you for watching
