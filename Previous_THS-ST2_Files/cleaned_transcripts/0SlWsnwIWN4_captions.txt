getting hit by a car coming the other way
oh it's got to be a way to do this I might
have to just force the issue like I do in
Thailand I think all right I'm going to go
the other room also wrong way up the road
see what happens come on out there we go
all right
part one get out of the road without getting
hit by a car tick that one off
okay that's Robinson's department store or
whatever you call it there on the left it's
pretty well known
pretty well known shop in the central part
of Cebu City a massive great roundabout here
really have no idea where I'm going so I'm
just sort of relying on the Google Maps here
so I've got to sort of try and keep my eye
on the traffic while keeping an eye on the
VPS as well which is
never easy when you're a little bit nervous
with your first ride in a new city
a couple of times I've been out walking I
took it around this sort of thing I've got
to be behind a bus unless they're turning
kill bananas
I love those orange shoes they're awesome
one up here he's off fantastic I've made it
1K without getting hit by anything or hitting
anything
actually I've got to go that way anyways I'll
follow that guy around there oh [ __ ] they
put a banana trolley oh they look yummy I
should grab one on the way through
okay
around the
traffic jam here which we can do about this
we've got a better null should I go through
or feed myself through here I reckon so let's
just go through you're not going anywhere
around this way
okay awesome
in the city here amongst the traffic it's
where these light Nimble scooters really come
into their own now this one's a 150 so you
see which I think is ideal for inner city
work and if I was to me just too small they're
just a cheap bike you can't afford a 150 in
my opinion the traffic's not too bad but it's
only middle of the day so I'm assuming like
most cities by the end of the afternoon it'll
get a lot worse
[Music]
they're starting to notice going up this hill
[Music]
a 155 a 150cc engine compared to the Hans
of compared to the Honda fours I had back
in Thailand now all right a bike similar to
this through Vietnam for about four months
uh two up with backpacks and other gear and
yeah I thought it was all right but gee I'm
really noticing the difference in the power
the like of it here so maybe I just sort of
got used to the bigger bike and yeah and this
one probably just as much the same as what
I had before but [Music] it feels really [Music]
slow one of a better description that's what
it is slow but then that's not all together
bad to keep him in a new city
speeding is probably not a good thing to do
and the road is really wet and dirty too
[Music] careful I don't have any locals just
telling Teddy
oh well done mate good merge
all right I'll wait for him I don't want to
put a dent in the side of his truck or on
the side of my head for that matter
[Music]
just pulled out for a quick pit stop as the
GoPro decided to freeze up on me I don't know
maybe it's the heat humidity anyway have a
look at the scenery behind me it's just great
[Music]
[Music]
you've got these houses supposed to be hanging
off the edge of the cliff here the road is
actually amazing it's it's really twisty a
little bit rough in places but not too bad
it's just really a nice little windy uphill
section for oh no probably a bit six seven
K's out of the out of the main part of Cebu
City and it's really good fun there hasn't
been a lot of traffic a lot of bikes but not
many cars or trucks too for that minute so
it's been really good so I'm really looking
forward to seeing what the rest of it's like
I'll tell you what if this is a taste of what
Philippines riding is going to be like it's
going to be one awesome trip that's for sure
sometimes a road to get to a destination [Music]
can be the best part of the trip
I've got a feeling that today it's going to
be one of those days
the scenery is truly outstanding
little restaurants and cafes all along the
sides of both sides of the roads
and the view out there is just incredible
I'll show you this is what you see on the
sides of the road virtually all the way up
here
we're sort of on a bit of a ridge line the
whole Road seems to be a bit of a Ridgeline
there's more trusty Steed for the day the
Yamaha nmax just doing okay so far pretty
comfortable bike
also over the road so you can have another
look what's on the other side proof to you
I'm not lying
I mean just check this out
that is utterly amazing
in the distance I can see land Over the Sea
there I think that might be Bohol the island
of bowhole I'd have to have a look on the
map to see where we are but yeah WOW Motorcycle
enthusiast and you love twisty roads you are
absolutely going to adore this
I'll go as far to say
first and bike rides I have done anywhere
in the world and including my home country
of Australia the pretty good ones there and
Northern Thailand Northern North Chiang Mai
Northern Thailand north of Chiang Mai is pretty
good I'm not sure where we go here
uh two choices there I think I don't know
why but anyway yeah back to what I was saying
it's just fantastic it's just Corner after
Corner after corner and yeah it's a little
bit rough but the suspension on the bike's
pretty good so it's stuck it enough easily
but it's just plain come it really is [Music]
two vehicles to pass but not too many they're
pretty easy to get by joffing get back to
enjoying yourself
it just seems like there's million dollar
views on every corner it really does
if you had real estate anywhere along a road
like this with scenery like this in Australia
and I assume a lot of other countries in the
world it literally would be probably a million
dollars or more for a building block no man's
Refuge 100 meters
oh there it is
done at an awesome viewer reckon he had across
the valley [Music]
it does too well I don't know if I Flute one
of the best rides in the Philippines or not
on my first outing but this is just amazing
it really is if you've got a bucket list guys
put it high up there you really don't want
to miss this if you're a bike Enthusiast trust
me
you've probably noticed I'm riding a lot slower
than I normally do
and it's simply because the scenery is just
too fantastic to take my eyes off so I can't
speed and according to Maps this is me turn
off here
[Music] this is an adventure bike Rider's
dream this place ever in my entire life have
I ever seen anything that even comes close
to this
in places
but nowhere near to the extent of this nowhere
near to the extent of what it is here
and it hasn't got the traffic of Bali either
which is a big bonus
don't know how safe it is to ride around here
on your own
hopefully it is I haven't heard any real negative
reports
big drop off there I think the key with a
lot of things are when you're traveling is
if you feel a little bit suspect about a place
and you don't have to don't stop I always
try and cover myself up a bit long pants and
long sleeves and full face helmet gloves and
stuff to try and hide the fact that I'm a
tourist in case I do get followed
well he won't
for watching this that live in the Philippines
but yeah I don't know I traveled a lot of
different places and yeah it's just one of
those things I I do I'll pass a casual glance
most of the time and won't get picked for
a tourist
s
foreign
uh
spare bike anybody
I wonder what the history of that is
oh right the road's getting a bit worse
not quite easy to get through but
I think yeah beautiful pie bitumen and concrete
is
starting to give way to to Mansfield stuff
but it's still good very skinny goat that
one more of them go to galore you know why
they're so skinny there's plenty of feed here
I don't you want to see on a narrow bloody
windy road is a truck it's pulling all right
no actually might be through cheers mate
thank you very much that helps
at least we've got that concrete back
it's actually smoother than the main part
I don't know what that is
what I think it couldn't take off too quick
all right I think I'm coming to the end of
our Trail here
because I've arrived but what
Roger the village that looks of it very basic
Village
pull over here for a sec and see if we can
work out what's going on there it says I've
reached my destination but then gets back
up there that Peak up there tell me to have
to turn around go back she took a bit of a
detour back there I think I'm back on the
right track [Music] I've just lost our beautiful
concrete road
oh that's all right only momentarily
no matter what it's just awesome ride through
you it's just great pretty cool too I mean
when I say cool it's cool boy
cool boy Asians dead it's still still pretty
warm by Australian standards especially we're
probably nice to Europe at the stage two I'd
reckon anyway I shouldn't be watching where
I'm going because that's what got me in trouble
last time is uh I wasn't watching them out
close nothing missed a turn off
[Music] yeah where do we go here
left or right
[Music] [Applause] my little blue arrows following
the white line
I'm not even going to try and pronounce the
name of the Mountain I'm heading to security
guard back at the hotel did pronounce it for
me but I have since forgotten
we have arrived Mount Mingle Peak I don't
think that's actually the peak I started out
to go to but anyway it'll do in the next
way up to the I'll put the Drone up so you
can get a good view of the surrounding area
and see just how beautiful it is from the
air so stay tuned to the channel guys got
some really good stuff coming up got more
on Cebu there's an amazing ride coming up
to the southern end of taboo and another Mountain
that claims to be the highest one on the island
and also we'll be heading off to the island
of Bohol and there's some truly amazing riding
there too so I really hope you enjoyed today's
video at least and if you did please give
me a big thumbs up subscribe down below and
thank you for watching and I'll see you next
time
