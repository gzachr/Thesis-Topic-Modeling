in today's episode my parents 
will try the lechon belly
i will keep it simple today so i'm 
going to just add some black pepper  
tanglat spring onions and bawang
of course
so i'm not sure this um it's normally 
done but i'm going to add some  
regular onions see how the flavor will be 
bow on of course and done that of course
and finally some spring onions so 
i cut these lengthwise see so they  
they will have more flavor give more 
flavor to the baboy okay so i'm gonna  
roll the bad boy and then i'm gonna put 
it in the oven for steaming for two hours
i think it looks good already to go in the oven
there we go so i'm curious how it looks now 
oh yeah it's the same same texture as last  
time so i think it went all right i got lots of 
comments from you last time uh what to put on  
the baboy when i put it back in the oven on 250 
degrees celsius and last time i put the cream  
which made the bad boy a little bit too hard so 
now i'm gonna listen to your advice because many  
of you told me that i can put a little bit of 
soy sauce on the skin which i'm doing now okay  
just a little bit of soy sauce nothing else and 
i'm gonna put it back in the oven for one and a  
half hour on 250 degrees celsius last time i gave 
sinigang na baboy i didn't give the rice of course  
with filipino food there needs to be rice i have 
i received lots of comments from you that i must  
bring rice so today i'm gonna bring rice with the 
lechon baboy so i'm gonna buy a bag of rice here
so i think this should be 
enough guys big bag of rice

the skin and so i'm gonna make a nice  
sawsawan but very simple i'm gonna 
keep soy sauce white vinegar sibuyas
okay but for now i'm just 
going to try with soy sauce

it's not hard the skin is not hard so  
i think it's really great
