to blaze
see hello everybody my name is katrinka and 
welcome back to my channel I'm a professional  
singer and a voice coach and if you are 
interested in anything related to singing  
covers or voice coach reacts you're in the right 
place welcome in get yourself comfortable you know  
why because today we are gonna be reacting to 
Marcelino p'malee this one was very requested  
especially after more resets I got so many 
requests and pleats please to my Selita you  
are gonna be absolutely flabbergasted I'm 
ready to be absolutely flabbergasted I am  
ready to get surprised I'm ready to get 
shocked I'm just I'm ready I personally  
absolutely love tamari said she was amazing 
I'm gonna leave the link to her video right  
here and without any further ado let's 
wizards an exquisite marsillett oh boy
I put in a little bit louder 
wish one on seven five
in watches where we can help 
us to be in times when we do
[Music] when we lose all
okay let me stop real quick for men he 
is very high might be doing a right thing  
without keeping it very tight and therefore 
he is more control there were some larger  
extended notes where he kind of develops 
his voice into perfect pitch don't get me  
wrong he's not flat he's not not hitting 
notes you could hear that he was a little  
bit under the perfect pitch but uh as he 
develops into notes and he got a little  
bit louder so he put a little bit more 
pressure he finished in a perfect pitch
[Music]
see [Music]
in hold
our ecology
yes tell us [Music] No [Music] wonderful [Music] 
basically what's his doing is creating his own  
doing consisting of him and then another him this 
is such a cool idea and it's quite difficult to do  
and he is like he's killing it I like that at both 
of the places he's got very very beautiful timbre  
to his voice so the color of his voice is very 
different but a very pretty on both places [Music]
boys [Music]
circuit are we [Music] the silly don't 
worry I will replay um the place but I  
just wanted to say to his deep voice to his 
lower registra it's such a beautiful color  
it's such a nice placement and what was really 
cool is that when he is singing in like a higher  
placement he was very very very tight but as 
he went to like a lower placement he started  
to relax a little bit more he started to open 
his mouth a little bit more and I'm glad that  
we got a whole passage where he could really 
just focus on the on the lower register and  
we could like see the whole part blossom it 
was really pretty [Music] Jeeter [Music] turn
we hope it somewhere [Music] ha [Music]
she made us cuddle [Music]
just like a preacher just like a rich
so due to his creative decision to sing 
both of the voices my Salido is bringing  
the ultimate sacrifice where he has to cut 
off the very end of the phrases which I'm  
not really mad at because I think in this case 
we are looking at the overall creative look of  
the song that Marcello is creating of course 
we all wish he could have a time in space to  
really develop the ends of the phrases in lenta 
you know let his beautiful voice shine but that  
means that those two voices would overlap which 
is very obviously not humanly possible so so in  
the end I still think that it's really 
really cool and the sacrifice was with
[Music]
just like a preacher just like a Ridge
need to find up why does we do we must be sir
[Music] I decide
[Music]
is Italian this also very nice [Music]
which collusive I wish I wasn't breathing with 
him fine oh my god I literally wasn't breathing  
with him that was very very very difficult 
part for sure so basically what he did those  
three notes that were following one after another 
they were like climbing Mount Everest the higher  
you are the last oxygen you are and basically 
in the very end he was almost suffocating but  
it has still kept his composure it was very 
very very beautiful pretty ending but damn  
the need for oxygen there was real please go
