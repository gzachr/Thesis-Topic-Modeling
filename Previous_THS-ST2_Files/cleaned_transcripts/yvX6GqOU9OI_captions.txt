cake of course and we have a chicken soup 
yeah of course noodles and rice as well and  
over there we have a pig hat which I'm very uh 
Curious never tried something like this before  
I'm wondering how can you eat this we we steam 
it like or boiled it and then we fry it's not  
crispy this time though so there's actually 
meat okay this one is the skin yeah so you  
can eat the skin I guess yeah here there's 
meat as you can see there is actually meat
okay yeah yeah okay what should I try first 
the pig yeah actually it looks like regular  
pig meat okay so we have the face of a pig 
here very soft but actually it's very similar  
to regular pork meat I would say so I would 
say this is actually very fatty and then we  
have the crispy skin around it oh it's actually 
very good very curious to try the tuna here fun  
fact the best tuna I ever had in my life was 
actually also here in mind last year when I  
visited D in southern M I tried tuna up there and 
that was the best tuna of my life so I'm really  
looking forward to the tuna here now this is local 
Tuna from here right yeah yeah so M too now yeah
mind oh yeah it's actually very similar to the 
one I tried in the very delicious I would like  
to make a sandwich out of it putting this 
Tuna on the on the bread with like cheese on  
top salad like a tuna sandwich oh because the 
meat is so delicious and this is chicken from  
from the village right yes our chicken chicken 
from your home yeah you can taste that it's been  
cooked in the soup yes lots of flavors from the 
soup also very delicious and then the good that  
we just grilled yeah there's a there's a charcoal 
flavor to it so you can taste it's coming fresh  
from the grill okay so after lunch we are pretty 
full now time to refresh ourselves in the cold  
Waters here so this is actually a Cold Spring 
I have been to hot Springs before but not too  
cold springs oh it is pretty cold oh yeah very 
cold oh but very refreshing oh the current is  
getting very stronger actually probably doesn't 
look like that on camera but oh it's actually  
very hard to walk against it here now oh don't 
move on don't move you have a spider on your head
SP or whatever it is put it on the work
here I mean the cheat we call them balite balite 
yeah what does it mean um it's like um they said  
that there's like unseen creatures living in there 
that's the belief in Filipino you think it's a  
haunted tree yeah something like that okay so I 
have just been offer with a red horse okay and  
we do have big bottles one lit bottles of red 
horse here extra strong extra strong beer how  
much alcohol is it 6.9% of alcohol so a little bit 
stronger than a regular beer and the Philippines  
also you drink beer with ice cubes right yes 
that's a sin in Germany in Germany that's not  
allowed because Germans are really proud of their 
beer and if you mix the beer with ice cubes then  
the beer gets watery yeah it loses the the flavor 
of the of the beer so in Germany never put ice  
cubes in your beer everyone will look at you very 
angry but I know in Asia it's pretty pretty common  
oh oh wow wow wow T guy like cheers yeah cheers 
T tag T Sal thank you very much okay let's my  
Filipino red horse be I like it it's not my first 
time trying this it's good it's good so we're not

Filipino tandu tand which is a rum yeah probably  
pretty strong we have like I don't know how many 
percentage of alcohol but usually rum should be  
around 40 what age can you start drinking beer 
in Philippines 18 18 in Germany 16 actually 16  
beer beer 16 and like rum or hard alcohol 18 but 
actually even if they're young as long as there's

oh Sal po thank you very much so she sells this I
think ah for the church oh she gives it 
to the church yeah yeah how long does it  
take to make one just a few SEC seconds I 
guess just a few seconds yeah or probably  
a minute for one we are trying to find a 
bridge right yeah yeah there's a little  
river here with a bridge that she would 
like to show me you have a little shop  
here as well so we can buy some some 
snakes some drinks some basic supplies
here I like your village looks very good I like it 
here yeah let's have a look at the bridge here in  
the village oh yeah is it safe to go actually it's 
pretty stable just that I'm not sure if the floor  
will hold my weight okay it's actually pretty 
safe hello hello oh they're washing dishes here  
ah so is this a clean spring water yes yes yeah 
right they actually drink this water oh you can  
drink it yeah I guess not many foreigners 
come here no you're the first one I'm the  
first one here yeah that was my guess hello hello 
kamusta oh you have goats here oh can I see the
goat oh hello hello hello oh they have little baby 
goats here check it out oh oh and baby chicken's  
over there oh look how big the the chicken is over 
there where's the big one have a look at the the  
big one over there that's the big boss oh is this 
a fighting chicken no fighting no no for fighting  
okay yeah sometimes in rural Philippines uh the 
chickens are also used for fighting why is the  
house elevated like this is is it a flooding area 
here I guess so yeah daong Bal K na ta B yeah for  
ah sometimes the the river is over flooding ah 
okay okay so then it's obviously smart to have  
the house built on stilts like this so when 
there's a flood coming then the actual house  
is not affected the male chicken partner of all 
the fem the partner of all the females what a
life so he's the father of all the baby chickens 
here canro here we go okay sub subscribers here  
in the village thank you very much Sal nice to 
meet you byee byebye it's very interesting for me  
because obviously this is so different to compared 
to what I'm used to in a German Village I grew up  
in a village in Germany I spent most of my life 
in a village but uh yeah the villages in Southeast  
Asia in general are of course very different to 
uh German Villages so it's always very interesting  
for me to see these Villages here you know a 
very nice travel experience to be somewhere  
completely off to beat path away from the tourist 
destinations hello hello let's see how they can
play let's see who will Who will 
get the points who will score
oh oh that's a good game
here I have the impression here that it is 
simp simple life out here in the village but  
I have the impression that people here are very 
happy it's a simple but a happy life whenever I  
am in these Villages and if you are follower 
on my channel for a long time you know I have  
visited Villages like this and other countries 
as well like Thailand Malaysia wherever I travel  
to and every time I visit Villages like this I 
always have the impression that the life there  
is a happy life you know it's a simple life and 
I don't mean simple in a negative way but a happy  
life people are always smart sming friendly 
the kids playing around you know so that is  
always very interesting and nice for me to see
