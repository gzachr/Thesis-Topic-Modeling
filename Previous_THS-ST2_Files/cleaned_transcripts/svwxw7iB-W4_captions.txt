hey guys from beautiful intramuros here in 
Manila I'm gonna tell you all about my journey  
with Filipino food [Music] Filipino barbecue 
restaurants are just amazing you can find them  
everywhere and you know I especially like one 
that was in Siargao where I went basically every  
day they open at 3 P.M so I waited until then 
and then I placed it on different pork sticks  
and chicken sticks and it's just amazing you 
know Filipinos really know how to do barbecue  
so definitely you go stop by a barbecue 
place [Music] so one of my favorite things to  
eat here in the Philippines is barbecue pork and 
the best barbecue pork around here is here hello  
so I always come here it's the 
best barbecue in Siargao yes
absolutely absolutely 
how much is it 210 perfect  
thank you get pork you can get a pork intestine 
isaw, vegetables, chicken... everything you want and  
it's just so nice and the people are so amazing 
thank you so much we come here basically every  
day and it's just amazing the next dish that I'm 
gonna talk about is one that I've tried recently  
and I fell in love with and this is Sisig okay 
guys so now we are gonna try one of the Filipino  
Specialties which is seasick and in this case 
is chicken sisik it's this mix of cup chicken  
breast with onions pepper and it's so so fresh I 
love this every time I I try every time I go to  
a traditional Filipino restaurant so let's try 
let's try this one of the things that it's the  
most special thing about this plate right here is 
the raw egg so there's a raw egg on top and then  
you mix it all and it's cooked with the plate
so now you see that the egg is getting cooked  
oh my God my mouth is getting 
like watered cheers [Music]
incredible the egg everything is so so fresh  
and like [Music] mmm it's your turn so 
try this amazing dish for the first time
[Music]
right? it has so much flavor
what do you think about it? very different 
I think yeah with the egg the vegetables  
awesome are in Bebie's barbecue which 
is one of the famous barbecue places  
here in general Luna okay let's try 
the pork Sisig it looks amazing
[Music] oh my God! okay 
Robbie try it yeah yeah let's see your reaction
hahaha [Music]
so guys here in Baguio the tribes are called 
igorot and we are going to visit a store now  
that it's uh owned by the igorot and 
yeah guys this is a mountainous region of  
the Philippines it's not really that that you know 
popular with tourists at least with International  
tourists and it's very close it's actually 
like three hours away from Manila the capital  
so we're gonna get this Strawberry Tahoe 
which is actually very very typical here  
in the in this region that's tofu and this is 
called Sago oh there's a strawberry nice nice
that's awesome
wow thank you thank you so basically this 
is soy so it's a soy milk uh it's kind of  
in a paste it has all these strawberry this 
kind of jam and you know strawberries grow  
here in this region of the Philippines so 
it's gonna be it's very local very much  
of a traditional dish and let's try

amazing it's very sweet it's actually yeah 
like like boba tea kind of yeah and you  
know all the bubbles they are so delicious I love it yeah yeah 
okay now it's time to try the Lechon Kawali. This is interesting because I've seen Lechon
everywhere and uh yeah it's a very 
traditional plate in the Philippines so cheers
you like it? I like it yeah so in body there's 
not that much sport as in Indonesia pork  
is not very popular because of religion this is actually pretty good I'm not like  
the biggest biggest fan of it because it's again like a little bit oily a little bit fried but  
I have to give it a 7.5
Now the next one that 
I'm gonna talk about it's called Isaw and guys this is just one dish that I just can't 
that just can't get through my eyes it's  
basically intestines you have this stick 
with pork intestines and for me it's just  
too graphic like visually it's not too pleasing 
but anyways I decided to give it a try and guys  
this is the first time that I'm trying this 
and actually you know I've been seeing this  
all over the Philippines but I never dare 
to try it for some reason wish me luck guys
bigger bite!
one more bite one more bite [Music] okay I wouldn't say it's that striking as I thought (Subtle taste)
but the texture is a 
no for me and the way it looks  
it's not my thing I guess so 
I think I have to give it a 4.5
so what are we getting now uh 
this is chicken Inasal
It's cooked in a very unique way apparently and it's
Grilled Chicken on the outside it looks 
toasted and then in the inside it looks  
pretty pretty juicy oh there's a sauce too [Music]
fork and fork haha
[Music]  
I will give it an 8, wow!
now this is what you guys have been waiting 
for now I'm gonna talk about balut now balut  
is a fertilized developing egg embryon it's very 
graphic too but in this case you know I waited  
until one of my last days in the Philippines to 
try it I the idea didn't get across my mind but  
I was brave enough and this was my experience with 
balut so today I'm gonna try Balut the famous duck  
fetus that is so popular in the Philippines 
let's try it okay so I just crack it and now  
it's time to try it here it is delicious okay okay

was not gonna like it but it's  
not bad I just mentalized myself and it's nice
