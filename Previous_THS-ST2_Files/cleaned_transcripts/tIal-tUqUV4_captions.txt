hey everyone it's michael here again and 
welcome to another one of our videos and in  
this video we're going to be talking 
about eating customs that filipinos  
do that you as a foreigner should eventually learn 
and get eventually used to as well especially here  
in the philippines now before we even get started 
with this particular video i just want to be able  
to ask you guys who don't forget to subscribe 
to this channel if you have not yet if this is  
the first time you watch this video welcome to you 
guys out there and of course don't forget to click  
that bell icon to be able to be notified of any 
new videos that we are going to be posting and  
we do post around three to four videos from now on 
so you know please stay stay tuned right so let's  
talk about eating customs here in the philippines 
and you know there are a lot of different customs  
here that are a little bit different than what 
you're gonna be used to in the u.s in europe  
right so i'll give you a quick example the first 
thing that you need to get used to is that table  
knives are actually not served or not placed in 
your settings most of the time when you go to a  
restaurant here in the philippines the traditional 
thing that gets put here is pretty much the fork  
and the spoon and you know a lot of foreigners ask 
themselves well how am i supposed to cut my meat  
how am i supposed to do this well traditionally a 
lot of the filipino dishes here are actually you  
know already cut up already for consumption for 
like you know one spoon type of a fill up right  
but also at the very same time is you know rice 
is such a big staple of a filipino's meal here  
so that's why you have that spoon because they're 
not going to give you a fork and a teaspoon right  
because traditionally like in in western countries 
we have our fork we have our table knife and then  
we have a teaspoon right next to that right that's 
the traditional setup of a dinner table now in the  
states in the philippines it's different it's just 
the large spoon and the fork and because you will  
have to scoop up your your rice you know rice is 
something served here all the time right i mean  
it's funny you can go to a fast food restaurant 
you know let's say like even like a mcdonald's  
and order you know let's say for example some 
fried chicken and they're going to give you rice  
with that as well so just go ahead and be used to 
that and understand that you're going to be using  
a lot of you know forks and spoons a lot and you 
know the food here um is a little is pretty much  
very tender that you can actually just use your 
fork and your knife to kind of just rip them apart  
um and at the very same time as let's say you 
do ask for a knife in a lot of restaurants  
they'll end up giving you not a steak knife 
but actually like a real knife right so just be  
prepared for that you know if you really need that 
knife for you if you ask for a you know a table  
knife um guess what you're gonna get a real knife 
you know and so just be used to that the second  
thing that you should get used to here eating in 
the philippines is that you might actually end up  
experiencing you know what they call kamayan right 
kamaya means kamai means hands right so meaning  
that you're going to be eating with your hands and 
so if that right there you know don't get offended  
if somebody starts eating with their hands it's 
such a normal thing here it's a traditional thing  
they have this thing called budo fight for example 
where you know they have um what are causing um  
banana leaves all over laid over the table 
on top of the banana leaves it's just all  
the rice all the different meals all the 
different you know meats fish you know um  
seafood stuff vegetables all that stuff fruits 
are all in there and the boodle fight means  
that you know just you know every man for himself 
pretty much in eating right so it's kind of cool  
and there's like i said restaurants there's a 
famous restaurant that's called kamayan which is  
meaning that you go there to eat with your hands 
um and it's pretty easy in some restaurants you  
know when kamayan is being used they will actually 
give you um some gloves to use to be able to eat  
right so it's not like you're just going to 
be eating with your hands uh a third thing  
that you're going to be accustomed here is which 
should be done anyways but uh not done a lot in  
a lot of western countries is you should actually 
wash your hands before eating but what's amazing  
here is that you know they don't you don't even 
need to go to the bathroom to wash your hands  
to the comfort room the crs they call it here 
they actually have you know hand washing sinks  
in the dining area i mean they have that for 
example like in a restaurant called mung in asala  
which is they're famous for their unlimited rice 
um the way they roast the chicken which is really  
really amazing right and they 
actually have hand washing stations  
in the dining area so you don't even need to go 
to the bathroom just to be able to wash your hands  
so you know people may look at you weird if you 
don't wash your hands before you start eating  
right so just pay attention that you can see a lot 
of filipinos doing that um the other thing that  
is very traditional here and that is you know you 
should not cross your legs under the table um it's  
it it's taken as it being informal right so like 
i remember i was eating at a friend's house and  
you know he crossed his legs unfortunately under 
the table and for some reason his his lola his  
grandmother knew it was and she just got upset at 
him she's like don't cross your legs you know and  
it was just hilarious um how it happened and of 
course he had to uncross it i said what's going  
on is that a bad thing and he's like yeah it's a 
bad thing i was like well you know i'm crossing  
my legs right now he's like well you know you're 
the visitor she's not going to say much to you  
but you know i'm the grandson so you know she's 
going to get mad at me so don't cross your legs  
under the table right it's it's eating customs 
that you shouldn't be doing it's it's it's very um  
bustos um as they say it you know meaning that you 
know you're you're doing something bad um and the  
next thing is of course and this is actually in 
a lot of other countries as well is never place  
your elbows in the table right that's just a sign 
of disrespect right if you put your elbows in the  
table it's like you just don't care you have no 
manners so you definitely want to avoid that as  
well and the next thing is you have to understand 
that meals here are regarded as a social  
experience it's it's family time it's time to to 
be able to have a conversations you know in in the  
western world you know sometimes yeah dinner is 
such an important thing but a lot of people just  
is so busy that people are eating separately you 
know i mean just think about let's say for example  
uh it's thanksgiving time and it's football season 
in the u.s you know everybody's not eating in  
the dining table sometimes they're they're in the 
couch watching tv well here you know if that's the  
case you know you really have to everybody has to 
come to the table everybody has to come there at  
the same time and eat at the very same time it's 
just respectful for the family to be able to have  
that moment of time you know and prayers before 
meals is something that happens a lot you're gonna  
you're really gonna see that they're gonna say a 
prayer before they eat um even filipinos eating  
in you know for example um a fast food restaurant 
you'll see a lot of filipinos before they start  
eating is they are going to say a quick prayer 
before they eat so you know you don't want to  
be that you know you want to be able to give that 
silent pause before everything starts because just  
imagine if you start eating then all of a sudden 
your friend or the people you're with just starts  
you know praying first while you're eating that's 
kind of embarrassing right so you know just just i  
always suggest for a lot of foreigners you know 
just to get used to the certain customs is that  
the moment you sit down to eat don't just start 
scarfing down and just start putting food in your  
mouth you know give time for people to settle down 
and see and see what um the filipinos are doing  
around you a little bit and and give them that 
moment okay um the next thing is as a guest if  
you're invited um to someone's house for a meal 
you are expected to eat a lot you may be full  
and you have the tita right next to you giving you 
more food you know because it's about showing that  
there's an abundance that they actually want to 
take care of you when you're in a guest of someone  
whether it's a person's house um or a person's 
condo or whatever it is or they invite you out  
to eat they want you to eat a lot right because 
them feeding you is an expectation you know um  
it's it's taken as a compliment as they may say if 
you if you're willing to eat the food and you want  
to eat a lot because you're showing that you enjoy 
the food but you know what sucks what if you don't  
like the food and you have to scarf them down 
just imagine that and you can't say that oh no  
i don't like the food it doesn't taste good you 
better just go ahead and rub your tummy and say  
this is some good food even though you for some 
reason just ate chicken feet um literally chicken  
feet and guess what they call chicken feet here 
right roasted chicken feet it's called adidas why  
because it looks like the adidas symbol right 
so three you know three fingers of the of the  
chicken so anyways um the next thing also that you 
need to understand regarding customs is you know  
let's say for example you know 
you and your girlfriend is eating  
in a table right you're eating and then for some 
reason uh she notices a friend of hers pass by  
i will guarantee you that the filipino is 
going to offer that person a meal and say hey  
come and join us she's going to say something 
like rika kaya means let's go eat so she might  
invite that person you know and so don't 
be surprised if all of a sudden that person  
sits down and starts eating the food that you 
guys have right she's going to give some of her  
food if it's like you know you guys have your 
individual servings or she'll order order her  
or him some food so that's such a natural thing 
so you know don't be like we're having dinner  
why are you inviting this person because it's 
natural that if you see somebody you want to say  
now that person who is offered that they can 
say no you know typically most filipinos who  
gets invited to join somebody else who's eating 
you know the the the correct way of having that  
is to refuse and say you know what i'm okay thank 
you so much i already ate no no i'm good thank you  
so much i already ate but if they offer it again 
and they say no no you should eat come eat with us  
and then you need to say okay let me sit down and 
eat with you guys or at least have a conversation  
so you know if you're offered to eat food 
just because they offered it doesn't mean  
they really want you to join them it's just them 
being courteous and making that initial so there's  
like some crazy people like yeah i'll eat sure but 
you what your job is to say no the first time but  
if they ask a second time then you say okay let 
me sit down and grab something really fast with  
you guys right so that's the best way to kind of 
handle that way uh the next one is it really is  
impolite right to let's say for example you have 
a gathering at your house you know the goal is  
to have enough food to feed everybody but the 
next goal is to make sure that you're able to  
send people home with food a take home pretty much 
container or something like that so it's kind of  
you know it's polite to be sent home with food so 
expect that if you go to a filipino gathering and  
you eat some food they are going to also offer you 
to bring some stuff home as well the next thing  
is is the tradition of merienda right um it's you 
know pretty much filipinos eat a lot right um but  
because they exercise they walk around a lot 
it's really hot in here that you know they're  
able to keep fit and have that thin frame um but 
there's this thing called merienda here which is  
like around around two o'clock or three o'clock 
in the afternoon and you know what happens is  
you know you eat something you eat you eat again 
so you have your breakfast then you then and then  
what happens after breakfast between breakfast 
and lunch you know you have these guys selling  
you know tahoe and all these other things and you 
can eat a little snack there then you eat your  
lunch then you have marienda which is around three 
it's the one between lunch and between your dinner  
um and so like i love marianne the time because 
you have these guys selling puto which is like a  
rice cake they're selling kuchinta they're selling 
all these little nice sweet delicacies that that's  
fun to eat um you have this sorbet this guy the 
sorbets guy is the you know sorbet right he's  
the guy that sells ice cream and stuff like that 
and he just walks around you know rings the bell  
and then you can go ahead and get some ice cream 
you know so i love the mariena time and it also  
is the part of siesta where you can also just rest 
and relax as well right just you know have a quick  
you know one hour nap now it's not really as big 
in the main cities those those one-hour naps those  
siesta times but the marienda is such a big thing 
as well so expect those i mean even during even in  
the main cities you have these guys walking around 
selling puto and selling kuchinta and selling  
all these other different snacks right barbecue 
banana i'm sorry banana queue and all those kind  
of things now for dinner-wise dinner is typically 
somewhere around seven it's served between seven  
to nine o'clock um at night um so that's that's 
such a normality here um like i said dinner is  
probably the most main uh meal of the day for the 
family to be able to get together and kind of you  
know tell me about your day type of a setup let's 
have a conversation that's when people catch up  
now here's the fun part you know breakfast here 
is not your typical breakfast at seven o'clock  
in the morning in the states right um breakfast 
here is like people get up around five or six  
and start eating breakfast and the reason for that 
is you know a lot of people who are working here  
you know do have to um how do you say i'm 
trying to think of the word here right now um  
it may take them a long time to get to work 
you know when they have to go to work and  
stuff like that and so because of that you know 
they have to wake up early so you know typical  
um breakfast that you're going to have here is you 
know what happens is the leftover rice from the  
night of the night before you know what they'll 
do is they'll do they'll they'll make which is um  
which don't don't don't confuse that with sinigang 
which is a dish in their philippines but sinag is  
pretty much the older rice and what they do is 
um they toast some garlic some minced garlic  
and then they put the rice and then they fry that 
so it's like a garlic rice and then they add some  
salt and some pepper with that and it comes up 
really good and so you have the fried rice it's  
and then you know they probably serve 
you either corned beef some eggs in there  
some filipino hot dog which are these red colored 
hot dogs so that's a typical breakfast that you'll  
have you'll probably either have coffee or 
you'll have um hot milk hot powdered milk  
you know there's a cup there's a brand called like 
neato that kind of stuff is what you'll be getting  
for your um your breakfast and don't be don't be 
weirded out when you actually see filipinos with  
a thermos these big thermos that you just press 
down to to get the hot water out because they  
they'll heat a lot of hot they'll be they'll heat 
up water and then they put in the thermos and the  
and that thermos can hold like i don't know like 
about a liter and a half of water and you because  
of that you know it stays hot almost for the 
whole day um so you know you have you can make  
your coffee coffee here is not traditionally 
just like most countries where you brew coffee  
instant coffee is pretty much very famous 
here so they have you know companies like  
a three in one by copico sun miguel who's like 
a beer company here but they also make you know  
they also make uh three in one coffees three one 
coffees are pretty much a packet that has instant  
coffee cream and ready sugar in there as well um 
so that's pretty much your typical breakfast here  
now let's say for example um you invite somebody 
out to eat right traditionally here whoever  
invites the person out is the one that pays for 
the meal you know traditionally in western you  
know western countries you know we do have these 
you know i pay for my food you pay your for your  
your food and that's pretty normal here uh 
that's pretty much normal i'm sorry in in  
the western world but here in the philippines you 
know what what's traditional here is if you invite  
somebody out expect that you're the one paying 
for the meal for that day so just know that as  
well right another thing that you also you know 
have to understand here is regarding tipping if  
you're actually out and about eating um you know 
in the us you know we're typically used to the you  
know the fifteen percent uh gratuity is what you 
should be giving that's you know that's a standard  
um you know in the philippines you know tipping 
is not really a big thing you know but you know i  
still try to tip people i mean like here you know 
if i tip like you know tipping here is like maybe  
if you have a four people and stuff like that 
maybe give like you know uh 100 pesos which  
is like two two us dollars uh average um so that 
something like that would be a good thing so just  
pay attention to that um what's what's weird 
here is like eating in fast food restaurants  
like you know in the us in europe and stuff 
like that you eat in a fast food restaurant  
like a mcdonald's right after you're done eating 
which what do you do you grab the stuff that you  
that you ate your your tray you know the leftovers 
and you just dump it in the trash and you put the  
tray on top of the trash can you know here fast 
food even fast food restaurants like mcdonald's  
like kentucky fried chicken jollibee and all 
those kind of things you can actually just leave  
your stuff in the table and somebody an 
attendant will actually clean it up for you  
um i still you know to be honest when i go to 
mcdonald's i still am the person that still picks  
up my trays that still goes ahead and and looks 
for the trash and dump it and it's really funny  
sometimes you won't even find a trash can because 
it's in the back room because the the attendants  
are the ones that's going to bring it back there 
so just to be nice you know i always grab it and  
if i see attention i'm like hey can i give this to 
you i'm done already and they actually look at you  
in a weird face like did this person just clean 
up after himself you know so you're gonna get  
used to that kind of stuff right now um let's say 
you're eating at a friend's house you're invited  
and stuff like that you know typically like you 
know in the households the the the father or the  
head of the of the family sits in this in the um 
head table right but typically if you're invited  
guest um you're the one that ends up sitting 
in the head of the table um or at least in the  
opposite side it has one of the main sides left or 
right or end or front right but because you're the  
guest and you know you're the center of attention 
because you came to visit and they want to be able  
to service you and help you out and the last thing 
um that you guys should understand when it comes  
to eating you know when you when you come eat 
a meal with somebody is that this is a real  
tradition that you guys have to understand and 
that is after the meal right this is how you show
that you are very appreciative 
and you loved the meal and that is  
you have to burp so you have to force yourself to 
burp and if you really want to show them that you  
actually enjoyed the meal is 
you better lay out a big fart  
did you hear that burp and fart that's 
how it is here in the philippines
i'm just kidding please don't do that because if 
you do that you're going to get in trouble i just  
wanted to see if you're still paying attention and 
if you stop the video before i even started the  
part where i said i'm joking i feel so bad for you 
guys right now because that's not what you should  
be doing you should not be farting or burping 
any time and anywhere at all at all all right so  
those are just some basic filipino customs and 
traditions that you as a foreigner should know  
when you come to the philippines and eat out 
here or eat at some friend's house okay or  
at your girlfriend's house at your wife's house 
you know family's house um those are just things  
that you should be aware of and you know just move 
along with it some of them you can understand and  
some of them you can do some of them you're like 
i don't know if i can do with that but that's my  
job here is just to give you guys and give you 
guys a bunch of information to for you guys to  
be able to make sense of things you know if 
you're a foreigner and expat coming to move  
down here to the philippines or kind of come to 
philippines to find your wife your girlfriend or  
just have some fun i think that these type of 
information should be given to you guys now
