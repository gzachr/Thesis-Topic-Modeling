hello everybody my name is katrinka i'm a
professional singer and a vocal coach and
welcome back to my channel today i'm gonna
be reacting to another of your really heavily
expected recommendations and it's gonna be
regina velazquez now i hope that i'm pronouncing
her name correctly because she's been very
heavily requested from what i've understood
she is one amazing vocalist and she is up
there with like a thripple of katrina velard
and maury said and other fantastic singers
today we're gonna be reacting to our gabi
live on wish if you would like to see the
whole performance don't forget to check the
description of the video and there's gonna
be the link to the original
[Music]
video and yes don't forget to subscribe our
new upload schedule is up on the youtube banner
and i'm also coming back to my streams i'll
be streaming on wednesdays and on sundays
check the streaming schedule in the description
of my video there's also gonna be what we're
gonna be doing on the streams so you can look
forward to them and now without any further
ado miss regine velasquez let's get into this
i swear to god if she's gonna be just like
another one on the same level i'll be jealous
[Music] and she's also pretty shocked
[Music]
oh i love when they sing in their original
language [Music] it has completely different
atmosphere [Music]
[Music] the melody is very addictive like
i feel like already [Music] it's very well
memorable
oh beautiful the melody is very dominant and
it's very memorable but it's still the way
she sings it i feel like she's reciting even
though there's a lot of melody in it but the
way she delivers it's a very high-based song
even though it doesn't look like that on the
first side but she push and pull and she's
just going it's incredible she doesn't even
do big breath pauses just to keep the fluency
of the storytelling that she's making in the
song and what is really wonderful is that
she's so fluent that you cannot even hear
her switches from her chest voice to her mix
it's just one beautiful stream it's incredible
i love it very [Music] intricate [Music]
you can tell [Music] beautiful ending of the
princess
um the very high high tone
[Music] i think okay so what i'm absolutely
swept away with is how fluent she is there
is no visible switches between her registration
whatsoever like you cannot hear them they
are there because she is going fluently from
one to another but as she's doing it's just
so it's invisible it's completely invisible
you feel like she's not switching at all but
she is switching but just completely fluently
at the very beginning she was just switching
between her chest voice and her mix but now
it's also up to falzetto like a very high
falsetto that was a little visible but that
was also a huge jump and she finished it with
a beautiful full head voice it's very obvious
that her voice is very mature it's finished
it's done it's perfection it's really really
beautiful kind of a voice and i'm really enjoying
her whole technique is just so intriguing
and delicate it's [Music] incredible you can
also tell there's no nervousness in her whatsoever
she's completely cool [Applause] [Music]
collected [Music]
foreign
oh beautiful run wonderful run
look at her she's just such a jolly person
very pretty one
memorize the tune
she's very relaxed like you can tell she's
not just mentally very relaxed she is in a
very calm collected place she's not stressed
she's not tense whatsoever she's even like
switching her sitting positions which is very
typical for a wish but someone in the last
video that i reacted on which someone told
me that they have to sit because a lot of
times they're actually in a moving bus which
is then absolutely understandable why they
sit but for belting it's really way more difficult
than uh standing up her belts are effortless
she has everything extremely relaxed and uh
yeah i feel like we're getting to finally
so let's see
did you see the big
[Music]
[Applause]
a little rasp in her belt
[Music]
there was a little respite end of the phrase
too so i think she did it on
purpose
her voice has so many different colors it's
incredible her voice is like rainbow and she
was just literally painting with tons and
tons and tons of colors i know that i'm using
where it's incredible and amazing a lot but
especially with these singers that's how i
genuinely feel inside and fuzzy and happy
because i got to hear that that was pretty
fast based song and singing this clean with
this invisible fluent switches just takes
a lot of control so she had an amazing voice
control her voice had a wonderful color in
all of her registers and her chest voice and
her mix but also her head voice of falsetto
was really major pretty heavy so it matched
with the rest of them very beautifully but
i would definitely call her like queen of
switches because you cannot see them you cannot
hear them you wouldn't find them if you try
everything was very well done very intricate
very detailed her voice is definitely a very
major it's very finished done polished and
also at a very last bill she had a little
bit of a rasp and she then added it at the
very end of the song where she closed her
throat a little bit to create an effect i'm
just gonna show [Music]
oh my god this is such a beautiful human [Music]
she's just a such a good vocalist that it
was so obvious that she could invest all of
her attention into the emotional side of the
song into into transmitting the emotions into
the music and completely sweeping you off
your feet as the audience so wonderful thank
