is petchay an ingredient for pocherong baboy yes 
or no so i'm going to cook pocheron baboy guys and  
i have sibuyas bawang kamatis tomato sauce chorizo 
i have pechay and some other ingredients as well  
as a beautiful pork meat so i'm very excited to 
be cooking this dish for the first time today  
so we'll start with heating up this pan 
with chopping some onions and garlic
so and then quickly let's set this aside now the 
pan is getting hot already so i'm going to chop  
up the baboy quickly so this baboy is really nice 
because it has quite a lot of fat and also bones  
you can see the bones here so i'm not going to 
cut it too small i'm going to keep a little bit of
chunks okay i will continue cutting the pork meat 
but i'll add mantika first okay we add the oil
and also the bawang
it's not so hot yet
i'll continue cutting the meat well 
the onion smells great on bango guys  
so it's nice this dish for me because i never 
tried to cook this but also i never ate it before  
but i always find it looks really delicious 
there's a helicopter here hope you can hear it  
but i said it it's first 
time for me to cook this dish  
and also the first time to try it okay i'll 
also add the onions now okay some shallots
smells really great so now i think it's time 
to add the meat okay so some pieces i leave  
a little bit bigger because there's still 
bone there i think that's nice see this one
so let's add the meat
a big
okay i turned up the heat a little bit
to brown the meat on all sides you can 
see pogi in the background see pogi pogi
so now i'm gonna add water some 
too big just to cover the meat
like that  
and then i'm going to add two cubes of beef broth  
okay i don't have any pork broth but i'm gonna try 
beef two cubes should be more than enough i think
and number two
okay so i'm just gonna cover this
so in the meantime i have a filipino 
beer here this is a filipino brand
just for fun i'm gonna add a little bit of the 
beer okay maybe it's not a good idea but it's just  
for fun guys just a little i know pork and beer go 
well together okay it's a little bit extra flavor
set up i will add the tomato sauce
already definitely there's gonna 
be a lot of umami with tomato  
and the beer and then the chorizo 
so let's add a few pieces of
chorizo  
mmm that looks good that it's 
getting a nice orange color  
with the sausage and the tomato sauce 
so then also i will add the tomatoes
and cover it again so i reduced the heat a 
little bit and it's time to cut the banana  
saging saging diba so i listened to your advice 
because uh you said that um i should not add  
pechay so i'm gonna not add a lot of pechay okay 
but just a little bit because i want to have a  
little bit green okay and i saw this recipe 
on panlasang pinoy with uh with pechay so i  
already bought it and the tomatoes were already 
cut so i i just decided to add them okay but maybe  
for next time i will not add any pachai so i'm 
just gonna cut these bananas in pieces like that
and then maybe one more time in half
like this and there's the sunshine yay finally 
i love the sunshine so uh i'm going to add the  
bananas but i will wait a little while because 
i want to have the meat really soft okay  
so i'm gonna let this boil for a while so to 
make the meat really tender then i will add  
the bananas and finally maybe a little bit 
of greens okay some pachai and string beans  
just a little bit okay oh pogi is sleeping 
there see hello buggy the meat is getting  
really soft now i checked it feels so soft 
already so i'm adding the saba we're saging
okay
the sauce is getting a little 
bit thicker already which is nice
okay and finally let's add a little 
bit of greens some string beans  
so let's cover this for a few minutes 
guys and i i think we're ready then  
super excited for this one guys some 
rice of course it smells amazing oh wow  
i will use um or i'll put some some bananas 
some saging and um and some pork meat  
and a little bit of patchai a little bit 
more bad boy in the chorizo oh wow i'm  
so excited to try this a little 
bit more saging some some sabaw
string bean then i'll add some tiny lumpias  
crispy lumpias i think it goes well see now 
tikman natin take some of the rice and the meat

so soft amazing and the taste is really nice
