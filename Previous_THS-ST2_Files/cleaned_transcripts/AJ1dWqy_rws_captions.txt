asking for anything man yeah yeah  
just be in front of me so how I see the 
shirt already over there the Red Roof  
all right and we found the church right here and 
it looks quite impressive quite big and yeah it's  
the molo church and that was built in 1831 by the 
Spanish yeah today is a holiday in the Philippines
you want a shout out uh-huh are you from 
Iloilo yeah yeah and uh you're here for holiday  
yeah because today is a holiday in the 
Philippines right yeah what holiday is today

but the church is not open oh cool oh the church 
is closed okay it's open from there right the  
doors oh yeah yeah oh we can enter over there 
the side door is open okay let's have a look  
okay nice to meet you bye-bye oh there's 
an ice cream man here want some ice cream  
actually uh I'm Keen for some ice cream 
let's get some ice cream here hello
how much is your ice cream 25
what flavors do you have oh okay can I get Uber
can I get a one Ubi and one cheese yeah 
yes Joseph if you want ice cream as well  
Joseph you want ice cream as well I 
just drank a lot of water okay yeah  
okay let me try it would be ice cream I've 
actually never tried Uber ice cream before
okay one Ubi one cheese place in a cone
can I choose which cone can I get 
this one 25 yeah okay this one please
and then I also like one more cheese
they're asking about your channel you're 
promoting my channel acquiring some followers  
I was promoting my channel here I'm getting shy 
Okay so oh that's okay that's okay I don't need  
so much oh it's very generous with the with 
the amount of ice cream he's giving me here
thank you so much
okay first time trying Ubi ice cream how do you 
say delicious here it's not mustard up not Lami  
you say Lami as well
so the language here is
a change
what was the name of the language here
okay let me see if this ice cream is Nami
yeah of course ice cream is always good right 
have you tried to be ice cream before oh never  
no I don't eat ice cream quite a lot yeah 
so when the other one is had cheese which  
I actually tried before cheese ice cream 
which doesn't really taste like cheese
very handy to have my channel name on the back it  
was a good decision to put it on 
the back of the Jersey yeah yeah
okay to be honest I'm not sure if I am allowed to 
enter the church with a sleeveless shirt you know  
and if there will be a temple I wouldn't enter 
like this really not sure I don't see a sign here  
so uh excuse me can I can I enter without uh 
sweeps so there is no one going math anyway no  
I mean like without the sleep that's okay yeah 
there is no ongoing message okay okay thank you  
okay then I feel good now oh it 
looks quite impressive actually
very uh on the same style from the inside 
as many churches in Germany look as well
yeah in case you don't know the main 
religion in Germany is a Christianity  
so the same as on the Philippines and we have 
many churches that look very similar like this
interesting for you to see as a as a Chinese 
fan yeah so in China you don't really find  
churches like this right yeah yeah no not 
a lot maybe only one person in the city  
so that's why it's interesting for you to 
yeah and I was in Thailand for example it  
was interesting for me to see temples yeah 
because we don't have that in Germany yeah  
always interested in the things that you don't 
have in your home country right and yeah these are  
the massive doors of the main entrance and then 
when you enter here you have to view all along the  
building and actually if you look up here there's 
a painting on the wall which I don't really  
recognize but it might be the the last meal from 
Jesus I'm not 100 sure about that and then there's  
another big painting on the right side which 
shows probably Jesus on a horse in the middle
and then yeah we have 16 of these statues all 
around and all of these statues are female saints  
and this church is also called a feminist church 
because we have all these female saints here
all right back in front of the church now and I  
just realized that okay this shirt 
is obviously built by the Spanish  
Spanish style and then the the square in 
front of the church this doesn't really match  
this looks more like it's from from the Greek 
or from the Romans but also it looks quite new
yeah yeah it says even Greek goddess of whispering  
so it doesn't really matter to the Spanish church 
right yeah yeah the Roman culture and Greenhouse
why are you singing
why are they singing a song
very good very good what are they singing for 
I would be curious to know what they think
that's the only small one yeah thank you thank you 
you can share you share okay okay have a good day
somebody of you can translate or tell me what 
they single thing about please let me know in  
the comment section you want a shout out

I don't have money thank you you cannot drive
like I don't have a problem like giving some money 
like for the for the girls that we're singing  
come to us and ask for money I 
don't think anybody like that
so that was interesting now okay
yeah the tricycle driver rejected me  
like isn't it his job to take whites who shouldn't 
he be like willing to take a ride yeah please  
translate in the comments I can watch what he 
said wondering why he didn't want to take the ride  
hey we find another jeepney another jeepney tries

as well I think so it looks fine hello can you 
drive yeah we want to go to Plaza libertad yeah
all right let's see what's going on now
okay how much yeah fair price please that's 
not a fair price it's not a fair price
I'm in the Philippines for over 
three months already I know by  
now what's the fair price and what's not bye guys
and I know it's just like a five minute ride so 
I learned from you guys in the comment section  
by the way telling me all the times if I'm 
overcharged they give us 150 from here to  
there 150 pesos 150. okay okay okay first day 
I'm waiting for my friends that's my brother
okay I'm still playing 150 is uh 
more than Locust would pay oh we  
need to wait for my friend he goes 
to the ATM oh yeah Okay one minute
but uh yeah I don't really mind like obviously 
like 150 is net dot net not that much especially  
if you're two persons but I don't like it if 
like uh I'm being overcharged just because I'm  
a foreigner you know and I learned from you guys 
in the comment section you're always telling me  
uh when I'm over charged and it actually happened 
a lot in the past two weeks one person sits here  
and one in here yeah okay you can either choose 
standing here or you go on the back with him
your English is fine
oh yeah you can hold up there 
right for his first time  
okay let's go I know we can also get some more 
Impressions while riding through the city what's  
your name okay nice to meet you are you from 
Iloilo yes okay we have a local tricycle driver
and they also have these bicycles here which 
are not motorized maybe you remember one of  
the videos in Davao where I actually tried 
to write one of them that was fun all right  
let's have some some looks here and my first 
impressions are that this city is quite quiet  
maybe also because today is a holiday so like let 
me judge it again in a few days or on another day  
but I feel like despite the city being quite 
large which I remember correctly like half  
a million people living here seems to 
be quite quiet as chaotic and busy as
easy and however up there
you have another lot of space here yeah the first 
time to sit on the side of the scooter are you  
used to riding motorbike taxi from Bangkok right 
yeah yeah we took them all the time in Bangkok
and check it out there's even a quilt written 
down here which is quite interesting beat a man  
with the strength of your argument not with the 
strength of your arm quite inspirational isn't it
so something doesn't sound right 
here everybody okay as well
do we have a problem now
what happened
oh good oh there was some sound 
it doesn't sound sounded too good
oh you hear it
oh oh
you know what it is you don't know
oh yeah let's check it what it is
okay let's see if we can find a problem
I think as long as the engine started I 
think it's not a problem with your bike  
it's just a problem with the with 
the sights car however you hold it
oh there's another church by the way English
I think it's just some something 
here that makes the noises
never gets boring in the Philippines
oh you think it's here
you want to go inside I will stand here do you 
want to stand yeah okay I can stand here right  
yeah yeah okay okay I want to try that  
so actually you can uh travel with three 
persons three passengers here on these tricycles  
all right to sound gun hello oh I think the sound 
is gone the noise is so we're good to go again oh
it's actually nice up here guys yeah yeah
okay
I think we should be almost there
actually we have arrived okay so much thank you 
very much hope everything is okay with your bike  
I think everything okay okay nice 
to meet you thank you very much
oh that was a fun ride right yeah five minutes 
riding through the city getting some impressions  
oh nice the wind is quite nicely right we 
realized that it's good it's not hot yeah  
like obviously the sun is shining 
but it doesn't feel as hot because
but yeah there's a nice winch breathing 
through the city which makes it really  
comfortable to walk around to actually 
although now it's like one o'clock so  
it's usually the hottest time of the day 
but still it feels comfortable here okay um
ah we have a 7-Eleven here  
let's get a quick refreshment my 
favorite convenience store in all of Asia
found that this 7-Eleven in 
Thailand has oh yeah do you do  
when you enter I mean they don't have it here yeah
you know the 7-Eleven in Thailand

want to drink I want to try something new

also have these sandwiches here and burgers 
that they can heat up here some rice dishes  
so if you're in need for a quick 
snack 7-Eleven is your place

the 7-Elevens in the Philippines yeah

drink that you can get into them  
just a sweet little coconut flavor 
refreshing but nothing special
okay we found a World battles we 
recommended a lot so from you guys  
so thanks for the recommendation we need 
to try Xiao Pao jumbo shop our King xiaopau
okay yeah we should try the pork adobo okay that 
was recommended a lot to me I need a mask here
some places they still require you 
to wear masks or I would like to  
wear your mask but most places actually 
it's okay to not wear a mask anymore  
okay I just order it but this lady 
but I pay here right yeah okay okay  
so she goes along the line and write down what 
we want to order I think to save time so you just  
hand over the paper with your order so we have two 
regular shell power and one water please one water  
one right here yeah one level two regular exactly 
yeah okay two regular okay thank you very much  
okay all right thank you very much okay let's see 
if we can maybe sit somewhere maybe over there
and yeah this by the way is uh 
downtown or slash Old Town I'm 100 sure
you want to hold it like this yeah
all right we are having the nine 
with numbers on the Jersey thank you  
okay where was I am yeah this is the uh 
either the old town or downtown I'm not  
100 sure but yes this uh Street here many 
uh shops on the left on the right markets  
and seems to be a more busy area but yes too 
remember today is holiday so probably not this  
is not the most busiest time from Thailand Long 
Island yeah I'm from Thailand from 500 pesos okay
all right let's give it a try looks like like we 
ordered a cheeseburger you know it looks similar  
oh it's a really big one wow yeah I have also the 
small size that we order just the regular size  
careful with the paper
get rid of the paper it has pork adorable 
inside have you tried adobo before  
uh no no what is adobo it's so popular dish here  
it's like a like a chicken or pork almost like 
a stew okay it's very good actually I think  
yeah I need to uh man this is huge not sure if I 
can finish this now but raw it looks quite decent
okay let's give it a try
oh it's a lot of meat inside
it like the convenience store 
downstairs but this one is much better  
yeah you know the dough is 
very soft still warm of course  
I'm not 100 sure what is in here looks 
like a mix of of pork maybe some onions
do you think there's anything else in there
add only two four yeah there's a lot of pork 
inside I really like the amount of meat inside  
here like sometimes you you buy these and they're 
like only the core in the middle there's some meat  
and most of it is just the dough around it but 
here you have more meat than you have dough  
actually which is really nice so this is really 
really good thanks for the recommendation guys  
kept quite busy here now we have a Street 
Markets everything being sold right on the  
streets full of people coffee tea seems 
to be uh yeah I think it's milk tea  
seems to be popular fruits being 
sold here socks watches jewelry

busier now over there it was 
so empty I feel like it's like

what it's written there in Chinese is that  
the same the same yeah oh why is Chinatown 
always the most busiest area in every city

of every town probably has a lot of small things  
and cheap stuff you know yeah a lot of people come 
for a parade you know it's always a market area  
usually in Chinatown yeah lots of Street vendors 
here oh it smells good here but I'm very full now
all right and we came to another Cathedral the 
jarrow cathedral built in 1874 so it's actually  
a little bit younger than the church we saw 
earlier today and this church was destroyed by  
an earthquake in the 1940s and after that has been 
being rebuilt and it looks like this today what do  
you think more interesting than the first church 
today I think there they are they have their own
what has been your favorite 
Church in the Philippines so  
far you visited a lot obviously 
the Saint Joseph Church in uh
okay okay nice yeah you're becoming a 
church expert here in the Philippines  
what are your first impressions in general 
about Iloilo today it's really authentic  
and lovely people are really nice here yeah 
I like it here yeah also I think it's like  
a like a relaxed atmosphere not as chaotic 
as busy Manila yeah and there's always this  
wind here so it's yeah not as hot and sweating 
to walk around yeah although by now the sun is  
coming out yeah early afternoon now so becoming 
a little bit more hot yeah but in the morning  
it was super fresh yeah exactly exactly if you
