If you're like me and want to experience a hotel
In one of the most scenic settings in the world,
I strongly suggest that you add
Crimson Resort & Spa Boracay to your bucket list.
Here the smiles are genuine and the
Service is outstanding.
Situated in an exclusive location at Station Zero
In Boracay Island Philippines,
And surrounded by pristine sand beach and
Crystal-clear waters,
This 5-star property is really a destination on its own.
It is obvious that this place was created
With enduring value,
Using superior design and supported with a
Deeply instilled ethic of unmatched personal service.
Although personal health and wellness
Are at the top of the list here,
The environment comes at a close second.
I guess it is safe to say that this place offered me
The most enjoyable stay up to date in the Philippines.
From the incredible design in top and finish in
All the villas to the jaw-dropping expansive Beach,
This place ticks all my boxes.
It is no surprise that it is now one of
My top hotels worldwide.
