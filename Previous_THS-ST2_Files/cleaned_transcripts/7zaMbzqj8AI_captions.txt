we're the lockwoods and we've been traveling the 
world to experience up close and in person all  
the natural wonders and distinct cultures that 
our kids would otherwise see only in textbooks  
and TV since we've been spending so much time 
in the Philippines and since we've been using  
Manila as a hub for a lot of our Asian travels 
and since our good friends from the mom duty  
Channel have moved back here and encouraged 
us to be their neighbors we've decided to set  
up a second home base here in BGC since we'll 
be alternating mods between here in the U.S we  
need to hunt for an apartment that's not too big 
not too pricey and not too far from our besties  
so let's get started imitation is the greatest 
form of flattery and we are copying our very  
best friends the ocampos at momduty because 
they just found their condo here in BGC after  
looking for a while so we're gonna meet up with 
them and we're gonna get all the advice we can  
get and we're not meeting them just anywhere 
we're gonna go right back to the very first  
place we ever met them earlier this year the 
Mine Museum we're recreating our first date  
a little bit and it's just a few blocks from 
where both of us are staying right now [Music]
my name is Melvin and with a Nancy how are you
I have like my bandana for him 
so he I can wipe him all day
all started guys right here it all started 
right here but here we are on a brand new day  
and we're gonna meet up with momduty another 
YouTuber family from California and they've  
been living here for a couple of months we're 
gonna experience the Mine Museum right here
Rocio Melvin and their two kids Mia and 
Knox and they're the same age as Colt  
and Brooklyn so they're getting to know each 
other I feel like they're growing up together
all right guys we gotta pick your brains about 
condo shopping here because we gotta find our  
place now that you have found your place but 
who wants to do it over maybe some mimosas  
at brunch mimosas for brunch I don't know let's 
go so freaking excited to hang out with the ABC  
fam this whole week we're gonna take them to Dr 
wine it is a little spot that's actually right  
under where we're staying right now and we've 
heard really good things about it this actually  
isn't our first time here because the very first 
time we were in BGC the Ocampos took us to Dr  
wine repeat history repeats itself yet again ah 
I forgot about that I didn't know he'd been here
but our own little section over here private party
[Music]  
uh I think I'm just gonna get the same thing the 
ocampo's got just copy everything so flattered  
it's a BGC but [Music] friendly I like Philippines 
because it's safe and there's lots of the people  
who respect people so they respect the area and 
look how clean it is the BDC check the rules not  
there's not a lot of traps there so that's a 
couple things I like about BC there's no trash  
it's old that's it sold we're moving now thanks 
Moxie that was a great point that Knox talked  
about because that's also something that we value 
Safety First just feels so good here I it's very  
family friendly yeah the walkability score here 
is like through the roof yeah the pedestrians uh  
are priority number one here so you get that feel 
of safety and you also have that convenience so  
when you're going I love the fact that you can 
just go down and walk out out of your building  
and you're in and literally steps away from all 
these restaurants like Dr wine I mean there's  
about 300 plus restaurants around us combine that 
with the Warmness of the Filipino people and I'm  
not trying to be biased here because I'm Filipino 
but they are very warm and welcoming that's what  
I love about that so you combine that with this 
it's amazing the warmth that you get here the  
community that we've been craving for so long 
is so welcoming we really don't feel complete  
here without the lockwoods it's a lockwoods must 
move here please don't move be our neighbors I  
think we would probably come here every day if 
we lived in BGC this would be like our meeting  
our brainstorm meeting would be at Dr wine would 
it be a good idea to work with a realtor or do  
we just like go around looking for listings 
on our own well we recommend working with the  
realtor saves time it's more convenient and we 
highly recommend JR from SW real estate he and  
this team are amazing they have been so great 
at communicating with us Non-Stop and showing  
us around at all the different locations so 
we are going to give you that recommendation  
all right done yeah we're just gonna copy the 
realtor then yes copy copy all right I guess  
we're just gonna toast on it you know Phil the 
Ocampo Woods in the BGC let's let the apartment  
shopping begin it definitely sounds like BGC is 
a pretty safe neighborhood for our fam but as  
non-residents of the Philippines we still really 
have to think about protecting our family against  
the same types of risks we deal with back home 
yeah even with the great medical facilities and  
doctors here we could easily bankrupt ourselves 
if something went wrong and we didn't have the  
right medical coverage safety Wings been our 
go-to resource for those things that seem to  
go wrong for us on a regular basis like the time 
I got appendicitis in the middle of Mexico and had  
to have emergency surgery or the time Cole got 
so sick in Vietnam that he couldn't leave the  
hotel for days or all the times Colt gets bit 
by reptiles and needs antibiotics can I like  
Adventure our biggest benefits with safety Wing 
are the medical protections for sure but we like  
that our policies also cover us against travel 
delays and interruptions lost checked luggage  
natural disasters and emergency evacuation and we 
love that whenever we need help we get connected  
with a helpful human being in a matter of seconds 
everyone knows that travel these days carries  
enough risk you're really just rolling the dice 
if you're not being proactive about protecting  
yourself and your family use the link in the 
description or just go to follow abc.com Insurance  
to get a quick quote from safety Wing now let's 
go meet our realtor first we need refreshments
lemonade medium with brown sugar may I 
get a winter melon milk tea with round  
shed brown sugar tapioca pearls 80 
sugar level level uh less ice cream
we gotta go bring the juices with us we'll 
drink on the road because we we're supposed  
to meet our realtor in about five or ten 
minutes but luckily everything is really  
close together we're probably only a block away 
from where we're going and we're gonna walk from  
one building to another because everything 
is so close together and walkable here our  
favorite thing to do since we've been traveling 
the world for three years officially now and I  
constantly talk about how hot and humid some 
of the places we travel to are I'm officially  
retiring that concept you will never ever hear 
me say that it is hot or humid again I went the  
wrong direction today of all days it is so hot 
and humid can we please just get there I knew  
that was gonna be an issue the only one seems 
to be more confused about where we're going than  
Erin is Google Maps just keeps changing the 
location changing the directions right there  
it says Verve residences Tower two and that is 
where we're supposed to be are you Jr yes yes
realtor too they've hooked us up all right so 
we have one place to look at him here today uh  
yes we're gonna check out the first place 
we're only looking at three bedroom units  
35th floor oh 35th floor get this apartment you 
probably get used to it pretty fast I love the  
positivity nice and bright hallways and smells 
of fresh paint built in 2019 four years old
you love it [Music] I love it oh my gosh this 
has to be my room because you know why in our  
apartment that we have right now I have this in 
my room and I every morning like because I wake  
up super early I had to just go out and stare at 
the sky while listening to music and this would  
be my bathroom so would this one come furnished 
yes yes yeah so all the stuff here States yeah  
the bed there is really small really yeah you 
guys can never fit on that boat together without  
no no it's short so yeah sure it's misleading 
we'll have to a really good start I love this  
unit and right here is High Street and this is 
the closet hallway so there are four total I'll  
get three so it gets one there's just one vanity 
sink in here but a walk-in shower I'm guessing  
there aren't bathtubs all right I want to look 
at this kitchen real quick love the countertop  
it's got basically everything I need but I'm 
a little curious the stove is very small for  
the space they allotted for it I've become one of 
the counter but I don't cook much so I don't think  
it matters I think that's pretty much par for the 
course same in the place that we're staying right  
now same with the refrigerator but yeah I mean 
especially for the uh ocampo's neighbors we are  
probably not going to eat in here very often maybe 
breakfast sometimes lunch for the most part we're  
going to be eating at every restaurant in BGC 
yeah that's true I'm not cooking but we're off
place it is listed for a hundred and fifty 
thousand Filipino pesos which is approximately  
I think it's about twenty five hundred dollars 
USD per month I like that it's Plug and Play  
TVs not just out here we've got one in the in our 
bedroom so two TVs I mean we really don't have to  
buy anything as far as Furnishings we would have 
to buy things like towels and linens and you know  
there's still things we would need but this isn't 
the most important part most important part is  
the rest of the building let's go check that out 
thanks a lot Brooklyn is asking us how we rate it  
on different levels and so she's keeping track 
of the score what does this one have honey 34.5  
we'll have to compare that because we still have 
to rate the building itself the gym and the pool  
and those points are out of a maximum total of 40 
then right because it's four of us so we're voting  
yeah can you start carrying a bandana baby so you 
can dab my face like Rocio does for Melvin yeah
freeze outside is cooler I'm gonna take a quick 
look at the clubhouse area right now called the  
function room so if we wanted to throw a huge 
party with you Campos or a big meet and greet  
this is where we could do it the over wedding 
this is a huge huge room there's a lot we could  
do in here meet and greet was the first thing 
I thought of there's a play area I think this  
is for kids [Music] I think I think she's outgrown 
this okay let's go all right where's this gym very  
important uh-oh we lost everybody also where's 
Colt this water is really cold that's going to  
be nice especially for Phil on a very hot day 
that feels good all right we gotta go though  
this is the lounge area this would be good for 
meet and greet also okay now this is the real  
pool huh it's shared with both Towers so we were 
in Tower two this is Tower one and they only have  
one really big pool right now I am specifically 
focused on if there are any high places I can  
jump from into the water here's the jam plenty 
of cardio four treadmills four stationary bikes  
dumbbells racks free weights lots of benches 
functional equipment checks all the boxes it'll  
work we'll get the job done apparently there's 
an upper level we gotta check out this is like  
an open space dance studio you could do yoga up 
here or practice your Tick Tock dances [Music]
whatever I feel like I would come up 
here if I'm alone and I would do my  
own little workout my isolated workouts 
for my abs stuff like that there's a 25  
degree different well Fahrenheit there's a 
25 degree difference between upstairs and  
downstairs in here I'm not sure what that 
is in Celsius five degrees seven degrees
foreign I worry about her and our schedule so what 
do you guys think of this building and this unit  
I think this is my favorite one so far it's also 
the only one the accomplice here's another Factor  
we have to consider we want to be as close 
to our besties as we can and they're gonna  
be without giving anything away about two and 
a half to three blocks away from here not bad  
we'll have to consider that after Brooklyn tallies 
up the scores between the three units we're gonna  
see the next building we're gonna see is right 
next door and they have a coffee shop right at  
the very bottom and this building is called the 
Meridian this is a nice cool air-conditioned Lobby  
30th floor for this one so a little bit lower 
which Aaron is probably happy about apparently  
a lot oh so a different layout here and it 
feels like it's thicker it feels more open  
all right so what's the price on this one this 
one is 140 with parking but parking is about 5  
000 per month which we don't need when you say 140 
what does that mean 140 000 pesos so this one is a  
little less but this is the master bedroom we're 
in here and whoo got dizzy but this is a really  
pretty view there's a lot of Park area right in 
front of us can't look and then this is the third  
bedroom so probably Where Brooklyn would be if 
we have this unit and it looks like there's a  
balcony but just Windows no access to it how many 
bathrooms in this one since there's no there's no  
ensuite for this room is it two two bathrooms here 
there might be another one in the maids quarters  
the yaya quarters I like how the kitchen is open 
I like this layout another bathroom yes yes but  
Yaya's bathroom so some apartments have that 
space so a yaya which is a Mater housekeeper can  
live in and stay there so the next place we see 
it's in the same building right thank you buddy  
I think you're welcome [Music] cool looks very 
similar to The Verve oh here's the gym I would  
say that the gym is very similar in in quality 
and versatility to the last place so either or
is it on or something there you go it's just got 
a lot of weight on it Jr what kind of deposit do  
they require it's a standard is too much security 
deposit that will be returned to you after the  
lease and are all these prices negotiable 
are they pretty set they're actually pretty  
set so we have one more okay one more unit we 
had to come back down to the lobby because it  
is different Tower and a different owner of 
the unit what floor is this one on this is  
um 33. do you like hi oh it's late lunch time 
[Music] oh yeah the couch is really comfy but like  
I feel like after a while it's gonna feel stiff 
yeah dining table is great this room is great look  
at the mirror I'm taking that by the way if we 
get this I'm sorry I like that this has a vanity  
yeah and we're missing that where we're staying 
right now and then this is the the Hall of closets  
here of purple the Ube closet now I'm hungry 
for dessert and these lights are interesting I  
like them I think they're they add character 
so this is culture for cleanse I don't know  
this is called okay and over here actually all the 
bedrooms have this view this is High Street right  
below here and our real term is telling us that 
it's really pretty at night when it gets lit up  
oh and there's the Nike store we have a view of 
the 3D billboard 4D billboard okay so also three  
bedroom two bathrooms right not counting the yaya 
quarters that's right which is right over there
a lot of counter space again with the ranges being 
much smaller than the space they fit into okay so  
this one this is the first I've seen a washer 
and a dryer uh it has the yaya bathroom and  
this is the first time we've seen an actual bed or 
mattress in the yaya quarter and this unit is 150  
000 pesos right in the same range I 
think it cuts a heavy door thanks heavy
all right that's actually 
really exciting stuff thanks  
for showing us pleasure to meet you guys thank you
but I don't know how the timing is going 
to work for us or not so we'll talk thank  
you so much I'm gonna go from least to 
greatest on water favor Apartments Belize  
it was actually a tie between the 
second and the third apartment  
um both of them were 30. they were in the same 
building so the gym part I guess was a 26.9 okay  
well I mean I think we know the winner right yeah 
and at number one is the first apartment 34.5 and  
the building in general was 32.5 I believe it 
I loved that unit that was clearly my favorite  
so that was everybody's favorite ranked at the 
highest voice let me point something out to you  
the first unit was the only one where you each 
had your own bathrooms the first apartment was  
definitely a clear winner for me I think that the 
building was newer the units seemed to be a lot  
newer and cleaner but For Better or For Worse 
we can't pull the trigger right now because it  
is mid-september and we really couldn't start 
a long-term lease until January at the earliest  
because we're finishing up this trip here in the 
next few weeks and then we won't be back until  
the end of December because we've got a really 
big trip throughout Africa for the Safari in  
November so we're very limited on being able to 
take advantage of having a home here basically  
through the end of the year so I think what we're 
going to need to do is keep looking and seeing if  
it's still available when we're ready to pull 
the trigger and really planning around being  
in something for the new year at least though we 
have a lay of the land and we under we understand
of what we're looking for and now when we 
see future units become available in those  
buildings we have a better understanding of 
if we're going to like them or not on paper  
before seeing them he's the Lizard King finds 
them everywhere well we really hope that you  
stick around with us to see what we end up in 
next time we come back we're going to do some  
more shopping and we're gonna be here more and 
more because we truly love the Philippines we  
truly love BGC and we truly love our besties 
that we have to live close to hope you like
