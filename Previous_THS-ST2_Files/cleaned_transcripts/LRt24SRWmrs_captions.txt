We have a new non-profit called
Filipino American Heritage Movement of Los Angeles
and this is our first event to roll out our non-profit
and to bring the community together for Filipino American History Month.
I think about linking the heritage between
the older generation and the younger generation
in Los Angeles,
which, you know right now we felt a little
bit of a disconnect.
We wanted to remedy that.
We wanted to bring the community together
and unify the ages, the generations and just
celebrate.
I feel like it’s a good network
and it’s a good way to branch out and meet
other Filipino chefs
and meet people that are Filipinos who are
willing to try my crazy ideas.
I think Filipino food is only gonna go up
and it’s only gonna get better because a
lot of chefs are very inspired.
I know I’m very inspired.
A lot of the chefs are renewing and rejuvenating
what was old school and making it new school
and making it more accessible to people.
This is a party!
This event is just the beginning.
You know, it’s good to recognize our contribution.
You know Filipino food is booming right now,
it’s hot right now so I think it’s a great gateway
for not only Filipinos but non Filipinos as well
to see what we have to offer.
