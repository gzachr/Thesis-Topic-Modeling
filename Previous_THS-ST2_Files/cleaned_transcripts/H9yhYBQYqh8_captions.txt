Little bit scary
passport was stolen
I'm still imagining
I wanna go there again
Philippines is love
What are we gonna talk today?
100% honest review about travel 
-100% honest review?
Real review
You guys going to talk about Philippines Travel, right?
Unfortunately I did not go on a travel because of work
As you know, Hooney & Woo went philippines
Let's talk about that
At first, you travel to have fun right?
Let's talk about good things
satisfying parts first?
I felt  , at first
Filipino looks happy
Where did it come in to my heart
Koreans are not good at enjoy music or dance.
-right
-but Filipinos dance automatically when music comes out.
They reveal themselves freely
-Thats' good
-So, they looks happy
There is music everywhere
They reveal their feelings honestly
I envy them
I also envy them and
Staffs, guides and even ordinary peoples were friendly
Filipinos are much nicer than Koreans.
I wanna go there
They have open minded culture
When you shake your hands
Then become friends
just a little conversation
-can make friend easily
-thats a good point
-Thats charming
And I am not sure but,
I think they have the ability to harmonize many cultures
There are many different cultures, including food and music
Can feel many things
Various foods are well reinterpreted.
We have to say about foods
Choobi choobi we went there
jolliebee, blue elephant
It was all delicious regardless of price
As you see our videos
we ate everything we ordered
All clear
The food was good
So, I think they might be happier
We thinks  about that much
Chicken BBQ seefoods are common in Korea, but
The foods are better than Korea
We eat Mcdonalds a lot
-right
-but even Mcdonalds is better than koreans
We ate well because we like salty food
But ordinary Koreans may think it's too salty
The food is usually salty.
I like that
me too
There was no rejection at all.
There was no rejection at all. and just delicious
Even the ginger flavored food was
-sisig?
-sisig was very good also
We thought sisig was snack for beer
As soon as I had a sisig, I thought garlic rice
So we ate garlic rice again
레알밥도둑 (Food that goes well with rice)
Do not scratch when shooting.
Food reminds me of the night market
I think night market is better than Korea
many kinds of food
night market in Korea has no place to sit.
but they have nice table
The second nice thing was that the food was delicious.
I don't need to discuss this.
Even though I have satiety, I keep eating
Third thing is
nice beer
The beer culture is so nice
The snacks are also in harmony with the beer.
Drinking cold beer in a hot weather
It was nice
It was awosome
Cheaper than Korean beer, but much better quality.
So you can enjoy beer all day long.
Beer is good
Forth thing is
Ocean was so beautiful
Fantastic
I wanna go there again
The sea was like emerald
When we went snorkeling tour
When we feeding fishes
Tropical fish came to me
water was super clean
I could see it far.
That was good
Color was good
If you go to the Philippines ocean, you can feel many things.
I kept imagining as I listened to Woo
So that was good point
Is there any bad point during travel?
Honestly, it's hard to find....
If we have to say............
I think you have to talk
At first this is problem
-is that passport? 
-no it is Travel certificate
At first day
As soon as we arrived, open our luggage
We are heading to IT park
Two strangers caught up with us.
They speak to me, but I'm not good at English
I said sorry and let them go
And then
I put my passport in my passport wallet.
and it's gone...??
but.....
We found a solution
It's okay without a trouble
Its not big deal but
I was disappointed because it was my first day.
I told it to the snorkeling guides
"Woo got pickpocketed"
They asked me
"Is he put wallet in his back pocket?"
And they said
"Never put it in back pocket."
"put it in a bag or safe place."
To be honest, I was disappointed.
But there was solution
So we can forget it
We are not disappointed with the Philippines
I'm just disappointed with him(theif)
2nd thing  what i felt was
A lot of smoke comes out.
Downtown air was worse than I thought.
It seems to be limited to downtown.
I went to Mactan and went out to the countryside
I can see many stars
Fresh air in the countryside
I can feel that but
Heavy smoke in downtown
Is there any safety issue?
Literally
Can talk about traffic safety
Driveway and sidewalk
The distinction is not clear.
Sidewalk is too narrow
So when i walk
Feeling like a car passing right by me
I thought it was a bit dangerous, but there was no problem.
Little bit scary
Sidewalk is only enough to pass by one person.
Usually people walk around the road
There's a lot of motorcycle
I thought it was a bit dangerous, but there was no problem.
First of all, Filipinos has an open-mindset
Enjoy music and dance
I like that point
Clean water is good also
I like to go underwater
I think there are pros and cons everywhere.
Philippines was fantastic for us
We had a good time
a few things were disappointed but,
In summary, everything was happy.
We fell in love with the Philippines after this travel
Philippines is love.
Anyway, my friends came back to Korea so.....
ready for the next video which was shooted in Korea
