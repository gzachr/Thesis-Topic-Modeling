there's an energy here oh there is a vibe  
it is crazy though everybody's waving to 
us this is like insane it's just crazy
we are officially here in the philippines 
i'm already feeling so excited i can't wait  
to show you what we're about to do today 
this is going to be pretty much our first  
impressions of the city we're gonna 
walk around we're gonna go and see  
a mall we're gonna go and see the 
city it's just gonna be amazing
so our plan for today is to just walk 
this is the street where our hotel is  
and we're just going to walk and see 
what the city is like he's posing
nice to meet you bye bye bye
so cute and friendly we're in the passe area 
so we're just gonna explore a little bit and  
then we're gonna make our way to makati and maybe 
see some of like the different kind of city life
what an energy
geez i gotta really watch out for all the cars  
we're already hitting the town running 
we're gonna go and check out the streets  
we've already got such a nice warm welcome from 
all the locals they're just incredible what a vibe
oh there's a group
wow it's mad i don't know where we're going i 
don't know where we're going but we're going  
it is crazy though so manila has a much  
higher population in bangkok and because 
we've just come from there i'm sure some  
of our interactions or comparisons will be to 
bangkok what are these look how cool this is
there's cars there's people there's bikes 
there's tricycles there's these cool little  
tuk-tuks i'm sure they're not called tuk-tuk so 
we're gonna have to figure out what the name is  
first thing we noticed everything 
is in english we're not used to that
everybody's waving to us this is like being plain  
this is like one of the main streets it's so loud 
they hooch a lot more than they do in bangkok yeah  
a lot everyone's so pretty 
there's an energy here oh there
everyone just wants to say hello this is awesome 
i'm completely overwhelmed but in the best  
way one thing that is going to take some getting 
used to is they drive on the right hand side of  
the road we're in thailand they drive on the 
left because they were colonized by the states  
there's a big american influence and that's one 
of the things but they were actually colonized  
by the spanish first and then the americans 
so just from our first few minutes we can  
actually kind of see the western influence just 
from the way people walk the way they dress so  
i think throughout today we're going to just 
learn more and more about how filipinos are
wow this is so cool
so noisy but how cool are these these are actually 
called jeepneys and the story behind it is there  
were millions of them left over after the world 
war here in the philippines the filipino people  
are so innovative they just converted them into 
pretty much like tuk-tuks the ones that you see  
in thailand they are used for transportation up 
to this day which means they're over 70 years old
is so crazy i'm a bit like overwhelmed there's 
just so many people so much happily but in a  
good way i just love the energy here we're gonna 
kind of make our way towards the makati area  
as well as bgc which is one of the main districts 
here in manila and i really hope you can hear me  
because with all the ambience with 
all the hooting with all the noise
it's just crazy it's still gonna take me a while 
to get fully stuck in but i already feel like i'm  
i'm here we've got such a nice welcome 
i can't wait to see more of manila
so that's something we know but also 
it's a little bit similar to bangkok  
because there are the wires everywhere but 
definitely a different feeling here so we're  
gonna go to one of the biggest malls in asia 
right now and we've just ordered a grab same  
as they used in thailand he's three minutes 
away and it will be there okay are you ready
oh it's crazy
we're on our way to the mall one of 
the biggest malls in the philippines  
and that is something i am very excited 
for uh how do you say hello in filipino
okay and thank you thank you salamat solomon
thank you very much
thank you very much
thank you so
now we are at sm mall of asia it is over 
589 square meters which is absolutely mad  
and we love shopping we came here because we know 
that the filipinos love to shop it is one of the  
shopping capitals of the world so we're gonna 
go and check it out and see what it's about see  
what the bus is all about and also the weather is 
not so hot it's not as hot as bangkok definitely
mole let's oh the aircon 
is nice look at that again
whoa ice skating i haven't seen that in a while  
this is a full ice skating 
rink it looks so popular
okay so we just found this cute little 
cafe in the middle of the mall called  
19 degrees and it looks so cute so 
aesthetic they have yogurt drinks  
tea it kind of reminds me of bubble tea so 
it looks good i guess we're gonna try it out
we got these cool drinks they're like a chocolate 
but they're sealed on top that looks so cool and  
we paid 120 pesos for it so how much is that just 
over two dollars we're still thinking embarked so  
it's about 75 baht for one of these we 
need to get used to changing the currency  
this mall is huge and you can see right 
now it's midweek midday and there are  
so many people shopping so there's 
definitely a shopping culture here  
so we're gonna have a little quick drink 
which is so cute and then we're gonna continue
there's definitely a lot more like an american 
and spanish influence even mexican they have fast  
food chains like wendy's shakies chilies which 
we've never tried before but we've heard of them
i'm like freaking out they have a 
tgi fridays here in the philippines  
they don't have this in thailand one of the 
best meals i've ever had was at tgi fridays  
so i'm sure at some stage we'll try this out
wow this is actually so 
cool we're at the promenade  
we've got to see so much in 
just one day it's unbelievable
there's such a cool relaxed vibe here in the 
promenade all along the way there are all these  
food stalls and everyone's kind of just riding 
their bike or jogging taking a walk it looks nice  
it's a lot a lot more relaxed than where we were 
earlier this morning oh yeah we went from like  
two polar opposites crazy busy traffic and now 
we're just like chilling and relaxing so cool
what is this
are we doing this we're doing this why not oh my 
gosh ever since i was a kid i've been obsessed  
with ferris wheels i don't know what it is but i 
absolutely love going on the ferris wheel i guess  
this is my first ferris wheel experience in the 
philippines it's a 150 per head that's awesome
we get to see the city wow what an experience

jam-packed what an awesome way to see the city on 
your first day i'm really happy this is so cool

take into account that i'm gonna actually  
be going really high up and now i'm like whoa 
that is a little oh no oh my gosh look at this  
look how cool this is they're already so high 
up not even at the top yet i was so excited for  
ship to do this i just wanted to spoil her but i 
didn't take into account that i need to go on it  
and you're slightly afraid of 
heights for some reason poor guy  
this is so awesome we're actually going so high 
up let me show you it doesn't do justice oh my god  
it's actually really high up why is it so shaky 
up here it's actually really nerve racking why did

oh wow that was awesome i really enjoyed that  
i'm happy we did that i'm so 
happy we did that what a day i am
we've now brought you to an area called bgc which 
is the bonifacio global city this is sort of the  
higher end part of manila and we just want to get 
a vibe and see what it's like you can see from the  
buildings behind me that this is a high end we're 
on the bonifacio high street right now which is  
kind of the main intersection there are lots of 
high-end shops restaurants and it's so cool it's  
so fancy we're in this like outdoor shopping area 
and there's so many chain restaurants starbucks  
jollibees which is the most famous food chain here 
in the philippines we're gonna have to try that  
out soon sooner or later so i think we're going to 
take a quick look around and see what we can find
it really reminds me a lot of like central park 
but it also reminds me of our hometown south  
africa and johannesburg this is kind of what 
johannesburg looks like it looks like santan  
or rose bank and it's kind of familiar to me 
which is awesome so far we've been able to see  
so many completely different sides of manila 
we've seen the crowdedness the chaos we've  
seen one of the biggest malls in asia now 
we're seeing the other side of manila which  
is the business sector lots of high-end shops 
it's really cool that manila has everything
wow what a place there are just so many 
shops i was not expecting this here in manila  
and we're just walking we're planning on going 
down there and it just goes on and on and on
