malls
in the philippines so today i will take
you along on the day to one of the
biggest malls in all of asia but it went
a little bit sideways i had some health
issues that
knocked me out for almost a
so people keep week me what is your
morning routine
how do you have so much energy
[Music]
so
[Music]
today's video
in some type of
area here in manila in the philippines
just got
here yesterday so today is like the
first
day here
i've already performed a bit of a first
impression kind of like showing the area
that we stay in gonna be traveling for
three weeks with mr biceps and uh
sir harry hello
and i'm very very pumped this trip i
think we're going to go to the islands
we're going to go to a bunch of
different cities
so as for now we're approaching some
type of public
transportation just kind of it's always
interesting to try i think we'll see
[Music]
[Music]
this guy is so sexy
out of nowhere it started raining like
crazy and we are
not accidentally at one of the biggest
malls oh it's actually the biggest mall
in the whole country so we're next to sm
mall
of asia
let's see what we can find inside and
you need to get a lot of things done
need to get a sim card really need to
get a coffee right now has been a long
day
[Music]
and while we're standing here
overlooking the skyline let me tell you
a bit about the channel's video sponsor
safety wing you know many countries
right now like the philippines like
thailand and many others require you to
have a travel and medical insurance if
you want to enter the country so rules
keep changing all the time i think it's
good to have one anyway so safety wing
has been always an easy solution for me
you just go on a website you can get it
for a few weeks for a few months or use
it as a long-term travel medical
insurance so safety wing i will put the
link in the description or somewhere
here it's a very easy process you can
quickly get signed up with it and so on
this note let's get back to today's
adventure
so as right now there's
three steps that need to be done
step number one get a cough step number
two i need to get to a pharmacy and get
something for my throat i've been tested
for everything i'm absolutely clean and
healthy okay
but i've been yelling around a little
bit too much
step number three we need to get some
sexy clothing for this trip am i right
yes please
pick me up
yeah unfortunately all i have is just
sports clothing about ninety percent of
my bag is just most clothing so danny is
gonna hook me up it's gonna be my
stylist for the day it's gonna be the
fashion channel today
all right let's do it
let's see
all right so here's a bit of an outside
area
and here is the mall
let's go in
hello
[Music]
no deadly weapons in here are allowed
i should have taken my gun
okay guys so walking into the mall i
mean it's huge it's like i would say
it's not like a lot of floors i think
it's three or four floors but it's
really really wide so i think we're
gonna be getting the
steps in today the cardio already at 13
000 steps so overall actually already
when we got stuck in dubai the goal
hello
the goal was very much to
get some outfits for the islands just to
kind of like get a little bit the vibe
going not just running around in black
shorts and especially because every time
when i leave the country i kind of like
donate most of my clothing
or i don't buy even too much in the
first place honestly but yeah it looks
like they have pretty much everything
you might want we got the regulars the h
m's
we got the zaras
so it looks like they have a full on
skating rink inside of the mall
just passed by two hours it's kind of
like 400 pesos which is
not like seven eight dollars so
not too bad actually
harry over here is considering to do it
but
let's see what type of entertainment we
can find here
overall high small and just the energy
generally very very busy not like too
loud or crazy but
just just nice also in terms of like the
last few years of travel beans also has
been closed off for two years
so we got like a huge three-story
carousel
okay still wandering through this huge
mall it seems like it's impossible to
find a proper coffee shop only kind of
like food court
and what are we walking in
m.o.a
neon alley
well let's go
the policeman is leading us
so god knows what this is for
you know the way i feel about it is i
think they it was just a construction
and kind of like it's one walk from the
other yes and they were like hey let's
pimp this
like it's a good shot put some lipstick
on that lid exactly
all right you guys gonna get a little
coffee going
you're gonna tell me the secrets
for biceps
yeah it's just a lot of cinnamon and a
lot of coffee
let's call you officer
lovely my friends bonjour
salamat pagi i've made some friends
i found some ladies
okay so just sitting down a little bit
having a nice little cappuccini
so we're gonna hit the stores afterwards
so what are we gonna do or check if they
have like a bowling movie theater
we're maybe some type of a little
theme park over here
and uh yeah boys what are we going to do
first place
there is rainbow yeah
there's a little ferris wheel i think
it's just starting out it's a nice
sunset actually here outside of the mall
and the more i walk around and the more
i speak my voice is just disappearing so
it's gonna be gone at any moment so we
have to get the video in oh my god
you're here
my voice
so we are in front of the dream twister
looks like our dream is going to be
twisted tonight
100 100
that's it
so two dollars
you got your
medical insurance
safety
and so on that note
down
down in the description it is it is if
you want to come to the philippines
you will need it maybe this is one of
the reasons why
maybe maybe i will actually segue into
it right now
let's see
instant regret
that's the final destination for this
trip
oh

people keep asking me what is your
morning routine

you get everything done during the day
all righty guys so we're hanging out
here and honestly i have to say today it
was kind of nice you get to see a nice
view

already down there's a slight rain going
on
but yeah you see a nice hotel what is it
your conrad see the whole mall

that was pretty good
it was nice
okay so we're walking into the cinema
here this man is ready to get executed
no 500 totals
you want to be in video
vlogger
and to stay with the theme of the video
we came out to a bit of a different mall
this is actually also where we stay
right now and um
honestly the mall we just been to
especially after the swing
doing a bit too much yelling my voice is
gone
but uh it's a nice big mall but in bgc
this is the area
right here
as well as in makati
i have to say the mods are much much
nicer
very modern like this area is absolutely
beautiful actually i'm very happy that
we're staying around here probably will
film a full video about it
and yeah so we came here what is it
uptown mall let's check it out
[Music]
[Music]
okay guys looks like we ran into a bit
of like a local
music festival
[Applause]
filipino
[Applause]
oh my god
okay guys it is right now
the next day i was about to say the next
morning but it's actually the next
evening
i took the day off a little bit first
day in manila we are right now in bgc i
think yesterday i showed you around
already a little bit in the evenings we
walked around
we kind of walked into some type of a
boy band i think they're called the
juans we looked it up later and you know
seriously so much fun we
then we walked into chow king the boys
went a little bit crazy and
lost my voice you probably still hear it
a little bit i feel great i feel really
excited
for the time to come
here a little bit this skyline of
vanilla
in the next three weeks will be really
exciting
but at the same time
uh yeah ali and harry i think they're
latin around bjc i took a little bit of
a day off just because the last week has
been super intense also let's say i took
the day off to do work to do editing to
do emails and you know just to be back
in manila right now i just went on the
roof a little bit and i felt again this
little certain sense of urgency you know
sense of sense of mission like years ago
i came to manila that was i think 2019
that was the oh no no
whatever guys
and you know back then my life looked a
little bit different at this point
everything the ball is rolling quite a
bit more i'm still documenting my life
on youtube doing a few things
behind the scenes and just things are
forming themselves a little bit and
whenever i come to a place i've been
before like i talked about this same
thing in thailand just especially after
a day by myself right now i'm just
feeling like yeah i also want to make
this philippine series right now a
little bit special
i really want to share this spirit of
you know going out there seeing more
building life on your own terms for me
that means building living remotely in
multiple countries and just
seeing more feeling more and um
hell just wanted to share with you that
right now for a second even though my
voice is a little bit
yeah
on this note
the manila trip is just starting out
no the philippine strip it's gonna be
three weeks maybe even four weeks gonna
be trying to see some new things visit
some places i've been to before with a
new perspective hopefully with new
levels of videos more fun more
excitement
maybe sicker drone shot but i think this
trip is going to be much about me with
the boys
yesterday were crap cracked up wrapped
up
cracked up too hard so this is something
also a reason why my voice is a little
bit
you know
and yeah we'll see what we can do i
think it's amazing you know to go out to
have
fun and also like have fun with the
people not on people's expenses and
yesterday ciao king
seriously you should watch the boys
videos harry and ali i'll link them
below in the description they started i
think less than a year ago but they're
blowing up on youtube right now and i
was for good reason so on this note
