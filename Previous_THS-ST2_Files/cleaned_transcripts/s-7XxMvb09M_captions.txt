red beans
hello guys welcome back to
pinoy planet today I will make halo-halo
a Filipino delicacy we will use
9 ingredients or maybe 10 OK let's
start
okay it starts to become something so
for the fourth ingredient I'm gonna add
some brown sugar so perhaps you would
use a white sugar I think in the
Philippines I only have brown sugar but
I think this is nice for desserts so
let's put a new layer
okay guys for the fifth ingredient we
need some strength because I know in the
Philippines the ice is very fine here in
the Netherlands the ice is a bit more
coarse big chunks so I need to make it
fine which I'm gonna do now hopefully it
will work
exciting guys a few more ingredients and
we will be done as you can see I have
made two halo-halo so let's go for
ingredient number eight
final ingredient guys you have to help
me because I have no idea what this is
looks like another bean but this was in
the halo halo mixture as well I'm gonna
add this as the final ingredient let me
know in the comments what it is
I'm really excited to taste it guys the
Filipino halo-halo okay let's give
it a try it looks very delicious right?
mmm I started with that ingredient
number ten I still don't know what it is
but it tastes really good
very yummy let's try piece of the banana
