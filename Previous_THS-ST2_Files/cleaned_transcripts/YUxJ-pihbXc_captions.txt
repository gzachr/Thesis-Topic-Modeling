- I'm about to have some kidney beans.
Like, sweet, sugary kidney beans.
Hi, I'm Beryl and the
theme for today's video
is foods for hot summer days,
because it is summer,
at least in the Northern hemisphere,
and it is hot.
- [Woman] How hot is it?
- 98 degrees and rising.
(gentle music)
The artist today is Lizzie-May Amos.
I thought that her art was perfect
for a summer-themed episode.
She paints beautiful floral garden-scapes.
I absolutely love these notebook designs.
I'm leaving a link to
where you can follow her
on Instagram and check out her other work.
The first dish is actually from Australia,
where it is currently winter,
but yeah, tomato, tom-ato.
We're alright.
(upbeat music)
- Hi everyone.
My name is Caitlin and I come
from Melbourne, Australia.
On a hot summer day, you will
famously find Australians
firing up the barbecue.
And with that in mind,
the summer dish that I think
of is not shrimp on the barbie.
It's grilled peaches
with a honey Mascarpone.
And if you're not familiar
with what Mascarpone is,
it's this beautiful Italian soft cheese
that's going to give you
these kind of melty, rich,
and less tangy cream cheese vibes.
It's incredible.
This dish is a summery dessert
that shines a spotlight on peaches
when they are perfectly in season.
It hits all the marks.
It is sweet, it's savory,
it's creamy, it's crunchy,
it's salty.
It's simple, most importantly.
I first came across this dish years ago
at a summer night market
here in Melbourne.
It was this amazing balmy evening,
and what you could smell was
this perfectly charred fruit
and caramelized honey kind of
wafting through the markets
and you just couldn't get away from it.
I was with my mum, my beautiful mum,
and we followed our nose and
found these grilled peaches,
grabbed a bowl, just
went to heaven with them.
They were absolutely phenomenal.
We basically just went straight home,
picked the peaches from her tree,
and tried to recreate it ourselves.
If you do not have a barbecue,
you can definitely grill
them on a pan inside.
Just be careful because
they can burn quite easily.
(Beryl laughs)
This is an absolutely beautiful dish
for you to make at home.
It is simple, it's
delicious, and I'm certain
that you're gonna make
it time and time again.
(upbeat music)
- Is it like a rule or something
where you turn your eyes
for just like two minutes
and everything just immediately burns?
I don't know.
Like, why?
There's no reason why
this shouldn't be amazing.
Oh my god.
Okay, this is so delicious.
The peach is, like, really
juicy and really ripe.
And then the Mascarpone
cheese is very rich,
but it's pairing really
well with the kind of fruity
fruit-ness of the peach.
And it is, like, this,
is absolutely what summer tastes like.
Oops.
As many of you know, I
live in New York City,
so I don't have access to a grill.
So, you know, like we do what we can.
But I do think that having
that smokey flavor from a grill
would make this even better.
Mmm.
I love a dessert that's easy to make,
especially when it's not custard.
It tastes pretty good.
It kind of looks like scrambled eggs.
There's so much to be said about eating
for the season that you're in.
Having a peach in the middle of winter
is just not gonna be a good time,
whereas a peach right now,
it's perfect.
Well, that half a peach was incredible.
Is that okay to lick a knife?
I don't know, whatever.
Anyway, it was a little hard
to find the Mascarpone cheese.
I had to go to a bigger supermarket,
but it was there in the yogurt section,
in case you go looking for it as well.
Let's keep,
let's keep going.

- Hi, my name is Loreto,
and I live in Murcia, Spain.
On those days when it's
really hot outside,
and you only want to have
something refreshing to eat,
my favorite thing to have
for dinner is Escalivada.
Escalivada is a cold salad made with
grilled or roasted vegetables
like peppers, tomatoes,
eggplants, onions, and garlic.
And it's dressed with
extra virgin olive oils,
oregano, and the remaining
juice of cooking the vegetables.
Its name comes from the
Catalan word escaliva,
which mean to roast with embers.
This is a typical dish
from the east of Spain
in places like Catalonia,
Valencia, Moj√°car,
and it has a really light and fresh taste.
that makes this dish very versatile.
And it is even tastier
if you can actually roast the
vegetables in the barbecue,
because you'll have that
smokiness given by the fire.
I personally don't like summer
because it is so hot where I live,
but I have such fond memories
of my grandmother preparing
this dish in the mornings
so we can chill it and have it for dinner.
Then when I saw her after
months of confinement,
I couldn't think of
anything better to celebrate
than to have Escalivada
for dinner in the garden.
You should try to make this dish because
it's really easy to make,
it celebrates all vegetables,
and you can keep it in the
refrigerator to enjoy it
during the week.
You can eat it on top of
toast, a slice of bread,
or as a side dish,
but have some paper towel
within reach because
it's going to get juicy.
(upbeat music)
- Okay.
I have Escalivada from
Spain and my house smells
so beautiful.
Like the roasted garlic
and all of the vegetables.
I mean, way better than
like using Febreeze.
Honestly, Loreto was not kidding.
This was a very juicy project.
(toast crunches)
Wow.
There's so much brightness
in this from the tomatoes
and from the vinegar that you put on top
and then just salting it,
just kind of opens everything up.
This truly tastes like the
bounty of a summer garden.
This dish is a perfect example
of what happens when you
treat vegetables as the stars of the dish,
and not just as like a side,
because they shine.
I love that the vegetables in this
are served room temperature,
so you have this warm, crusty bread
and then the room temperature vegetables.
It really makes me want to
like sit outside on a summer
evening and like have a glass of wine
and eat like 10 of these.
So the footage of Loreto
cooking with her grandmother
was something that we had emailed about.
She said that she was gonna be cooking it
and asked if I wanted any footage.
I'm like, yes.
And it just, when I was watching it,
it's just like how special is this?
You know, for me,
a lot of these dishes are
these amazing new experiences.
And then seeing them like this,
it was this really great reminder
at how food is not just about eating,
that it's not just
about fueling your body.
It's also about connecting with people,
and seeing Loreto cooking
with her grandmother,
I don't know.
It just, it was all of that in one thing.
And I loved it and it made me really,
really excited to eat this.
And I love it.
Loreto, I love it.
(upbeat music)
- Hello everybody.
My name is Maddie and I'm
from Manila, Philippines.
Today what I'm going to share with you
is a dish that we call Halo-Halo.
And it's something that we look
forward to every summertime
here in the Philippines.
Halo-halo can be roughly
translated to English
as mixed together 'cause that's
what basically the dish is,
it's something that you
mix things together.
It's made with shaved or crushed ice
and a mixture of different
kinds of preserves and toppings.
Overall, Halo-halo is very sweet
because of the different preserves,
but it's balanced out by
the creaminess of the milk
that you drizzle over the Halo-halo.
The Philippines is a very
diverse country culturally,
and so halo-halo, although
it's a very common dish,
there are actually many varieties of it
all across the country.
More than it being refreshing,
I like it because of the
experience that you have with it.
You can't just dive into the dish.
You have to slowly make your way through
every topping
and every preserve and everything
that's just in that bowl of Halo-halo.
Halo-halo is said to be an
influence of the Japanese.
Some say it can be traced to
a similar shaved ice dessert
called kakigori, and its
distinct features include shaved
ice, some syrup, and also milk.
So there's a creaminess aspect to it.
Eventually, Filipinos
improvised by adding their own
ingredients, which are
locally available to them.
And the number of ingredients
just accumulated over time.
And that's how we got
our halo-halo of today.
Hope you enjoy making it yourself,
and hope it refreshes you
just the way that it refreshes us
Filipinos here in the Philippines.
(gentle music)
- Oh man.
I had to like race to set
up this because I'm ah,
I hope it didn't all melt.
I tried to go as fast as I could.
Beautiful.
Eee.
I have to mix it all up.
Can't be lazy.
Ooh.
Okay.
A lot of it definitely
melted, but that's okay.
Well, and I was very
excited to try the flan.
Flan with shaved ice is the combination
that I never knew I needed.
I'm about to have some kidney beans,
like sweet, sugary kidney beans.
Okay.
Does the halo-halo just
like melt immediately
when you're eating it out in the street?
Mmm.
Obviously a lot of things went into this,
finding that one halo-halo mix jar
was really helpful because
now I don't have like a
million jars of things.
Just like, you know, a
quarter-million jars of things.
I've never had jackfruit before.
Mmm.
It tastes like something
that I've never had before.
Man I am,
my ice melted a lot.
I feel like I have
halo-halo soup right now.
Okay.
So my favorite parts of the halo-halo
are the ube halaya, yum,
the flan, so good, like cold flan,
it just mixes so well with everything.
And I really like the red beans in this.
This episode was amazing.
I'm gonna do one more
before the summer up here
in the Northern hemisphere
comes to a close.
So leave me a couple of other
dishes that I need to try
before we head into the next season.
Recipes are always in the description,
and thank you to everybody
who was a part of this video.
And of course I will see
you all in my next one.
Ta-ta.
