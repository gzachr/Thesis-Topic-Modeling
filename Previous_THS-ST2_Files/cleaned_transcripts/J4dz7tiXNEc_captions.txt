hi everyone on today's video i'm going to 
be reacting to why people in the philippines  
are giving away food for free this video was 
highly requested but it was difficult to find  
because i was looking for it on youtube and 
then i found out that it was on facebook so  
let's go for it but before i get into the 
video please subscribe to this channel if  
you're not subscribed because there's 
a lot of more new reactions coming  
and you don't want to miss them 
so now let's go into the video
right now as you watch this video people in the 
philippines have been putting up food stalls not  
one not two but nearly a fifteen hundred all over 
the country and this is not a shop if the food you  
see here is free for everyone this is the story 
of community pantries an initiative that every  
country needs to know about because you see in the 
world full of food waste and financial struggle  
this is inspiring they have a bike community 
pantry to distribute food to many areas  
they have a pantry for delivery drivers they 
even have a palm tree for stray dogs and cats  
but why did they decide to do this in times of 
struggle after all this is not a rich nation  
don't many people there face life difficulties 
well they do but it all started from one goal of  
this one person one day a selfless woman wanted 
to help those who were struggling in lockdown  
she set up one pantry which was posted on social 
media and within 24 hours it went viral before  
she knew it more and more people were doing the 
same thing it gave us hope despite our situation  
some people are saying thank you because it 
encouraged us to help too it is unbelievable how  
many people followed what this one woman started 
a group of k-pop fans set up their own pantry  
this family of farmers donated their harvest 
fishermen willingly gave their catch many  
vendors donated fruits and vegetables they were 
supposed to sell everyone came together and most  
importantly no one abused the system just look 
at this driver who got some food and later came  
back to give his own contribution this is what 
the spirit of community is all about and i hope  
many more countries can be inspired by this the 
philippines have been under a lockdown for over  
a year now they have over a million covet cases 
people are losing jobs many were losing faith  
but all it took was one kind soul to spark hope 
again and again and again from one person to one  
country and now this one country is becoming a 
whole world because they have already inspired  
one country to have their own community country 
with so many fights and disagreements i see too  
many people around us lose faith in humanity 
but it's not because humans are bad it's because  
we focus too much attention on the bad things but 
we need to believe that good and kind people still  
exist everywhere around the world and this is why 
i hope we can come together and share this video  
to inspire more people more countries to start 
community countries kindness like this deserves  
to go vital and may it be a reminder to all 
of us that small acts done by many people  
have the power to change lives and restore 
our faith in genuine human kindness  
this is amazing this is just
of course i get emotional my god
is just perfect and so necessary 
because there's a lot of food waste  
a lot there's a lot of people in need everywhere 
in the world sadly so of course more countries  
needs to follow this i've never experienced the 
kindness like the one that i experienced from the  
filipino people honestly it's such a beautiful 
community is oh my god i cannot wait to visit  
i've got a lot of good friends already 
over there so yeah honestly i cannot wait  
to go and and visit and meet a lot 
of you and that would be amazing  
and yeah it's so good and so necessary 
because again there's a lot of food waste  
and it's such a shame when when there's a lot 
of people that doesn't have anything to eat  
and i remember at the beginning of 
the pandemic here that i couldn't do  
shopping for over i don't know it was three weeks 
that i was really scared because i went to the  
supermarket every day and i've mentioned this 
in other videos i went to a supermarket every  
day and i couldn't buy anything and when i say 
anything it's like nothing not vegetables meat  
fish rice pasta nothing everything was empty 
they just had some cleaning products like  
it was it was quite scary luckily my 
grandma taught me well because my grandma
was born just in the middle of the civil war 
of spain so she knew the struggles of war  
and they they were at those times in spain they 
were living in rations and it was something  
i don't remember the quantities exactly 
but it was something like maybe a liter
of milk per week for a family and my grandma had 
nine brothers and sisters so yeah what do you do  
with one litre of milk for a week so my grandma 
always had this little pantry you know i think  
she was obviously she was damaged by the war so 
she was always like so so i need to have always  
i don't know for example two kilos of rice so 
when i'm going to take one i will go to the shop  
and just replace it so she always had this little 
this little pantry with basic things just in case  
something happened and i learned that from 
her because i learned cooking from her and i  
learned everything from her i always i always 
do that as well and i haven't lived obviously  
in anywhere or anything but i don't know i 
just do it because of her because she told me  
so luckily nothing happened 
because i had provisions  
but i saw at the beginning people going to 
the supermarket and getting trolleys full  
of food but perishable food like 
i saw a guy taking like 15 letters
seven kilos of tomatoes like you are not 
going to eat that there's no way that you  
can eat that before it spoils but they were 
just greedy and selfish and not thinking about  
everyone else because okay if it was pasta rice 
okay it's not going to spoil i i still think  
it's selfish that you get i don't know 15 kilos 
and you leave the next person without anything  
because we are talking about food people 
need to eat but then i remember like a week  
later of this craziness when everyone went 
and bought everything from the supermarkets  
including toilet paper i don't know what 
what the hell happened with the toilet paper
uh the people who works in the in the like the 
garbage man were saying there's a lot of food  
untouched like a lot of fruits vegetables 
a lot that they just went to waste because  
people just went crazy buying 
everything and then let it spoil  
and it made me really sad and i was really 
upset with the community here in this country
but then i saw this video of 
the philippines and it's like
they're still good humans in the world 
i just need to move to the philippines
because honestly it's such a such a beautiful idea  
such a beautiful idea and i hope that this 
is going to be more of a global movement  
i i i assume that the supermarkets are 
not going to be very happy about it but
it's all about humanity and 
kindness and honestly this video  
this video made my day this video put 
a put a smile on my face and i loved it
i loved it so yeah thank you so 
much for telling me to react to it  
please let me know in the comments what do you 
think and as always i will leave all the links  
to my social media on the description box so yeah 
have a lovely day and see you in the next video
you
