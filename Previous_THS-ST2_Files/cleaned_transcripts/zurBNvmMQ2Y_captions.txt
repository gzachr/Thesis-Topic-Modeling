(organ notes)

- [Brad Newton] Bye!
Man, this place is awesome!
I never bought so much
from a bee shop before
this place right here.
(upbeat guitar and whistle harmony)
- So, it is almost five
o'clock in the afternoon;
I wasn't even going to film this, 'cause
I didn't think it would be worthwhile,
but we're at this bee place,
right, it's a bee farm and
at first I was like, "Eh,
bee farm, okay cool."
Wasn't gonna film it as I said.
I actually am kind of regretting
I didn't film the beginning
of it but,
this is actually pretty awesome.
There's like, first and
foremost the bee shop,
the Buzz Shop, I believe
it's called, which you'll
see all the videos of
us tasting and sampling,
and I've never been to
any kind of shop and gone,
"This is awesome."
There wasn't one sample
that I didn't, it was like I
was like gonna buy the whole shop.
So, you gotta come here
actually and down here
downstairs, you walk down
the stairs; so up there
you walk down the stairs,
you come down here.
There's a dive shop just here.
We're right on the edge
of the water and you could
literally just chill out here.
This guy's snorkelling just over there.
Pretty amazing, the sun's about
to set and there's clouds.
Just hits you in the face with
that sunset; pretty amazing.
(upbeat guitar and whistle harmony)
Has anyone ever had Peanut Kisses?
If you have let me know, let me know.
(ripping package)
Ice cream.
(crowd chatters in Filipino)
I feel like an ice cream now;
I haven't had ice cream since
I was, I don't know,
not long ago actually.
Six months ago, gelato.
I feel like (not discernible).
(crowd chatters in Filipino)
Apparently ice cream is
a big hit around here.
Everybody's eating ice cream except me.
Do you want an ice cream?
- [Brad's Friend] (laughing)
- I missed the tour; so the Bee Farm tour
is every 30 minutes.
Check this out.
Missed it by 30 minutes; oh well.
If you come here, do the bee tour,
and let me know how you go.
I think that's it.
I think that's it.
Let's hire an aircraft, let's do it.
Let's hire an aircraft.
Bohol Aerial Tour and Services.
That's it; finished.
We didn't see the bees!
I know, we missed it, we missed the tour.
Alright, so that's it guys;
five o'clock in the afternoon.
End of the Bee Farm; finished.
Didn't see any bees, that's,
I'm guessing you come to
a bee farm to see bees;
I didn't see any bees.
Just went to the bee shop and
ate every sample in the shop,
and walked out with almost
every product on the shelf!
It was worth it, though; it was good fun.
It was really good fun.
But if you head down to
the Bee Farm let me know
what you think so that I
know I should definitely
come back here the second time.
Back to the driver, back
to the accommodation,
to chill out.
Ciao!
