we wake hear the birds and see the sun warning 
everybody another Another Day in Paradise with us  
we find ourselves here in the loan Cebu at 
a cacao Plantation our friends set this up  
for us so a gentleman that runs this Plantation 
is going to take us through the steps show us  
around and we're going to learn more about where 
chocolate actually comes from because you know we  
love chocolate and it just doesn't come from the 
local grocery store or sorry sorry store yeah so  
stick around we didn't know what we're to expect 
so we're kind of excited and again this is just in  
the backyard of everybody lives in Cebu basically 
so let's go check it out they're calling us now  
let's go all the good times
before no no have you oh no it's really 
interesting I'm afraid you're laughing is making  
me scared how is it I don't know why I'm going 
to be eating how did you have an idea about it
uh what happened last six years 
ago there are siblings coming from
foreigners who are cultivating 
these are usually I do it myself
do they harvest cacao year round year round 
for harvesting no season okay okay just like
before I even arriving to the cacao Plantation 
what do you think chocolate came from  
I know I came from
cow I knew I keep it yeah I just didn't 
know the process I've never really seen  
yeah just another process I've seen cacao before 
I also just didn't know it was a fruit yeah I  
didn't know that either the I guess it's a seeds 
on the inside is what actually produces fruit so  
we're taking a tour around Vermont Plantation and 
he was letting us know that before the hurricane  
there were a lot more cacao trees because of it 
it's all gone well most of it I'm dead she's she  
just wasn't a nice person so but I mean it seems 
to be the story all around the Philippines I mean  
she destroyed so much but but if you never 
knew it and you came here you see how green  
and Flash and things are growing you would never 
know so it just shows how you know perseverance  
pays off and they're not giving up so they're 
gonna keep building and building and building  
and growing and growing and it's really nice I 
like to see it and it doesn't discourage people
so bitter try it what is it
I like it okay it leaves a very bitter time 
what do you use it for cut I can take it  
how is it that's it it's literally 
what I imagine at least oh my God
corned beef
it's so good how much medicine I 
had I can take anything exactly  
I can think oh it's so sour 
it's like better it's like
the best parts of the film oh I love 
it handful already but I'm I'm good  
she's crying in there she's crying on the 
inside I see it clears her eyes are watering
I know this is medicine and good 
for the health so hi guys hey guys
so you see all of these plants here vegetable 
fruit we have Chinese cabbage they're growing  
it here on the farm so they can give to the 
perox so it can grow their own vegetables  
like that's so kind that one very thoughtful 
because I mean they could easily just keep it  
to themselves and just sell it to the Bronx 
but for them too I think harvesting them  
is our hardest part so once they're fully 
grown it makes it a little bit easier for  
the people in the Bronx to finish growing 
up yeah because they're they're they're  
letting them Blossom now because they have the 
right conditions to do it this way they can give  
it to the procs and they can grow their own again 
super kind very thankful and I'm not surprised not  
surprised I'm not surprised either all right 
guys we can't come here and not introduce the  
reason we're here and what's your name sir um 
how long have you been managing this Plantation
how many cacao trees were there 
before all that before 600
603 and how many are there now
okay so we're almost to the pre-ordet numbers 
which is good can people anybody that lives here  
can they come visit the yeah that's nice so if 
you're over here why not we got our cacaos now  
we're gonna head back and we're gonna do 
something magical with them right here got  
it and size comparison is it bigger or smaller 
than my forehead it's actually smaller which I'm  
not surprised at all and this is a full grown all 
right guys fast forward we're here in liloan now  
with our cacao beans and we're gonna open them 
up honestly I don't know what's inside of them  
because I'm already as confused as well as knowing 
that it's a fruit and not a chocolate bar inside  
I know what's inside of them they're cow beans 
pretty cool right I don't know how they look so  
Nettie is one of the best cooks we have ever ever 
met we'll just keep it that way so she's gonna  
help us open these cacao beans and see what's 
inside of them and we're gonna make hopefully  
something delicious by the end of this video 
yes yes all right let's go through the process
ing
oh
I almost cut the seats
oh wait that's what's inside wait why are they 
White they're probably covered to keep them safe
oh yeah I didn't realize you can eat that
can I try one yeah okay let me try I'm afraid 
you're laughing is making me scared so just eat it
don't eat the seeds laughs
did you swallow it how is it I don't know 
why I'm trying to begin munch it like  
just under this one and then 
just did the seats I'm done
lingu Nadine
whoa this one has a lot more man hello
it was like slimy that's what caught 
me off guard but that's to protect  
it I guess like it looks like a 
premature like animal or something
it's the world's biggest larva okay
will and I didn't know cacao was a fruit I 
I think we just didn't know anything about  
we didn't know anything about it we just uh you 
know it is a fruit no that's why it has a seed
is that chocolate I mean look at it it's like very  
like slick it's gonna come alive in 
a minute we're gonna start moving
because we need to let them dry and they 
should look like this is this crack nutty yeah  
so they gotta look dry we have to dry 
them up first before we roast them and  
guys we have a third one which is very 
special to both of us let's open it up
wake up the babies out here to get some stuff
oh yeah this is Prime real estate nobody told 
me I had to wait three days for these to dry out  
now I thought I was gonna go ahead and start 
roasting them and make me some chocolate but  
cool like honestly we had no idea cow was a fruit 
now that we've opened it it's got seeds it makes  
sense but we're just used to the finished product 
being presented to us not the whole process it's  
really cool that we're actually doing this 
hey you gotta treat them like your baby so  
you might as well sleep out here care for them 
I'll just go find a chocolate bar or something  
but no seriously I went three days to be done with 
already I want to see this whole process through  
oh should we do like a cool transition when 
you snap your finger and they're dried no
back and now we're somewhere else or wait
nothing close okay
it's been three days yeah it's only 
been 10 minutes well no hurry it out
board do you know what brand of shine I'm gonna 
come out here and check on these bad boys because  
Splinter kind of like my kids my chocolate kids
wow
foreign
it was well over a week and those I was about 
to say walnuts those cacao beans if we're still  
looking pretty wet yeah very pale very very 
need some sunlight need more sunlight than  
we couldn't wait so we just went into the 
bakery next door and got some crinkle cut  
and of course my favorite Cadbury chocolate 
bar and um I mean that's what that's going  
to be the end result anyway right I mean 
it's gonna end up being sweet delicious  
and it's gonna make you want more so cheers to 
this whole process and to the patience people  
have for making cacao that we don't like that we 
don't have all right let's go all right cheers
