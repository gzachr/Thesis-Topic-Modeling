want to keep it all to myself and not
let suzy have it what how dare you

she's going to be mad at me
and i'm probably going to be sleeping
outside or something so let's take a
look inside the box so
much it's nicely packaged there's a lot
of treats in that box
and i don't think we're gonna eat all of
it because once we open it we have to
eat all of it

look at this premium kickass
that's so new manju so it's like red
bean oh i love red bean y'all
i think they made this from onsens they
literally built a factory on top of an
onsen
and they baked it on top of the hot
spoon i think so too
but what happened did you just rip the
packaging this is like
premium packaging
this is like collectors
you really taste the bread right as you
bite into it right that's
really good what pika how do you do it
i'm so impressed to be honest

i thought it's like a bowl but it's
actually not it's thin

that's definitely different than what i
thought it would be it's so new

this one much turtle because i used to
eat this i love when i was little
oh my god i haven't tried this for years

oh my childhood memories i'm gonna give
this to susie because this is her
childhood snack and i don't want to take
it away from her i think it's
mochi to put it i love mochi suzu has
like a little mochi place by her house
in japan
