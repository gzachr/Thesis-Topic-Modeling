So I saw this video floating around on the Internet
just today
and it's labelled A Night of Wonder
with Disney+ released by Disney+ Philippines.
But what really caught my attention
was that I saw Stell from SB19 featured
as one of the performers in this performance.
And if you've been following my channel
for a while now, I've grown to be such a fan of SB19
that I thought I couldn't miss this performance
and this video, and I just want
to share my reaction in this RV.
So if you're here,
then you're probably on the same boat as me.
Just quickly reading the comments
before I watch this video, everyone saying
that it's quite a Goosebump-ey performance.
So I'm...
I don't know, my expectations are quite high.
And I think I think it’ll live up to it.
So I'm ready to go for a ride.
As usual, if you're enjoying this journey of
discovering SB19 with me, don't forget to subscribe.
Now let's get on to the show.
Zephanie,
huhu...
Is this movie out already?
I didn't realise they remade Pinocchio.
Oh, her voice is power
it’s so sweet too!
Let's go.
Janella.
Oh, this is making me...
Giving me all the feels.
This is one of my favourite recent
Disney movies as well.
So...
Oh. Hmm.
Yes. Oh.
Oh. So much feels.
There we go.
It's Stell!
Yes.
Oh, this song always lifts me up.
And it's so good to see.
Stell sing this too!
Oh, oh.
Okay.
It's got to be frozen.
It just had to be, right?
Oh, they're all going to get their own part. Yes.
Oh, I love the choice
in the harmony there.
Oh, I just feel so lifted.
Huu...
Oh, that was so explosive.
Oh, that was a cool as feature.
It's so cool to see these big up...
up and coming stars of Philippines,
I believe, right?
Like featured on Disney+ because it's all the kids
who will grow up with these icons and these idols.
I don't know who's funny
and I've never heard of Janelle,
but because of this collaboration with Stell,
I've been introduced them and who knows,
I may check out more of their stuff too.
Overall, like that was so good.
There's so much nostalgia in the music.
Absolutely.
Disney always does that.
To you, to me,
I'm sure anyone who's ever experienced Disney
growing up will always feel and have a special place
with Disney in their hearts.
And whenever you get someone new,
someone you're familiar with, some artists
take on a version of a Disney song for themselves.
It just resonates differently.
That was great to watch.
I hope you guys enjoyed this reaction.
I want to hear what you thought of this performance.
If you do want to check out my journey
into discovering SB19,
I'll link you a playlist right here of all the songs
from the get-go to where we are now.
I'm a fan and if you are too,
you don't want to miss that. So until next time.
I'll catch you guys around.
