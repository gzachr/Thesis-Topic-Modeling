we are going to be reacting to SB19 
mapa this is their live performance
that's very interesting like it almost 
sounds a lot like like enchanting
i mean this sounds wonderful honestly 
this sounds like a beautiful tributes man  
all right let's check let's keep it going
oh my god that is so charming you can need 
hearing them and tribute to your to your mother  
i mean what a beautiful thing what a beautiful uh 
way of doing stuff like that one thing about it is  
like they're performing this live which is crazy 
it's like it's great but the thing about you have  
to worry about it's such a big space and still 
you don't want to like voice to deteriorate or  
echo anything because they're so well and versed 
and controlled in their voice it's ridiculously uh  
impressive how they're handling such a wide room 
in in itself because things stand like places like  
that things will tend to echo and and distort 
the sound but like you can barely hear that
foreign
now
foreign
i mean for any parents you know hearing this if 
any parent like going through having kids like  
that there are those talent kind of talents and 
stuff like that it's just like you want to go and  
support your kids as much as possible i know like 
their parents must have gone through a lot just to  
just to like be able to get them to where they 
are like that also like i'm you gotta have a  
strong support behind you if you're trying to 
accomplish something in life or anything like that  
so it's great for them like their parents are 
involved in that and they're honoring their  
parents because of all all the struggle they've 
gone to all the hardship reganzo and stuff like  
that it won't be easy and for them to to be 
singing about it like this and to be paying  
tributes to them it it it's great because one of 
the one is like the song that i reacted i believe  
it's what they were talking about how much uh 
confidence they have shaking off all the haters  
all the doubts and stuff so meaning like also the 
parents has a play to plateau in their support  
system you know everybody need a great fun 
and foundation a great support system and  
this this is just one of if you have a strong 
and strong people backing you you can accomplish  
anything and not alone just in your talent alone 
obviously but like also another aspect in life
a little rasp right there on his voice at the 
end is just like it drifted with with it it's  
just like it's a nice echoing transitioning 
with the sound and the music i watched  
all of their stuff pretty much um music video but 
never live but hearing them now live it's just  
like these guys are not meant to be messed 
with SB19 it's just crazy that this is um  
my first time reacting to them live 
hey philippines honestly you guys have  
quite a lot of talent i've begun to realize 
that like easy meal also i reacted to him  
and which is just like he's another 
insane insane artist that i love a lot too
beautiful transition by the way
put your heart and soul into it and make 
it a good one and which they're doing  
and in harmony what they are so well like put 
together you can tell there's nothing there's no  
weakness into the group it's just crazy how SB19 
function and stuff like that it's great harmony  
between them and nobody is trying to overshadow 
anybody it's just it's just the sequences the  
transition between one another is like well done 
man honestly this this is a actual multi-talented  
group i've heard them rap i've heard them sing 
i've heard them do a lot of stuff dancing and  
everything and now here they are doing just 
straight up melody you know paying tribute to them  
to their mothers just and fathers and all their 
parents and whoever supports him love it i love it
ncca national commission culture and the arts 
i gotta check that out that must be like a  
a school or something i don't know but like 
generally it was a good it's a good song um  
really really well done um torsion yes that little 
oh my god it's like a little soulful in there you  
know you know they did actually put a lot of soul 
in there but yeah i love it i actually love it  
and that's going to be ending video
