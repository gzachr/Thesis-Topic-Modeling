- Sometimes when you travel things just
don't go according to plan.
And sometimes for that very same reason,
they turn out much, much better.
Let me update you on
what happened yesterday.
(dramatic music)
I'm so embarrassed right now.
(laughing)
This town is beautiful.
And here we are in Buscalan, Kalinga.
We just arrived the town, there's pigs
hanging out in the sidewalks,
and we're looking for our home stay,
this is Whang Od's house.
Before meeting Whang Od.
(upbeat indie music)
Let's get settled in, and then explore.
Excuse me, excuse me, excuse me.
(pig squealing)
Don't touch the pigs.
It's okay, oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah
Belly rubs, belly rubs for the pig.
We have found our home stay.
It's, lets call it basic.
If we go in, we have one floor,
we have two floors,
and we have mattresses.
The style of sleeping is
great for a sleepover,
you just start with the pillows,
and the cushions on the ground
and y'all sleep together,
that's how it works here in Buscalan.
Alright I'm here with my man Francis,
are you from here Francis?
- I am Francis Pa-in.
- From Buscalan?
- From Tinglayan,
Buscalan, Kalinga province.
- From the province?
- Yeah.
- And so people in Kalinga province
originally were headhunters, yeah?
- Yeah before.
- The before?
And they used to have tribal wars,
and then they would take heads.
- Yeah because some tribes
want to get more land
and other tribes, they don't like
and they start tribal war yeah.
- And the tradition of Kalinga tattooing,
came from, the men would
come back with a head,
and then they would get
a tattoo like an honor.
- Yeah they cut the head, bring at home,
have a victory dance, and butcher pig
or Water Buffalo, and everyone invited.
The men dance with the gong,
and the women dance like an eagle.
- Okay.
- All with traditional Tapis.
And then after that, the men get tattoos.
- And the woman also had tattoos.
- The women for beauty.
- Oh so the men liked
woman with more tattoos.
- And the men if you, kill
someone from other tribe,
and then after that you get tattoo.
- So the men had to earn their tattoos,
and the women it was for beauty.
And so when Appa Wang Od
was a beautiful woman,
I guess she had many tattoos yeah?
- And then if, if you are
a man and have your tattoo,
many woman are attracted to you,
and the men attracted
to women with tattoos.
- So it's a very deep culture,
it's much more than just oh I
want a tattoo cause it's cool,
it was like status symbol,
it was you are beautiful, you were strong,
you had accomplished something.
- And if you're a man, you're a warrior.
- And a warrior.
Well thank you my man, I appreciate it.
(dramatic music)
Okay, adventure update,
we are outside Whang Od's house,
and we've just learned that she has
stopped tattooing today because
there was a death in the village.
She seems quite sad actually,
as anybody would be if I think it was
a friend of hers passed away.
We're gonna see if we
can help with anything,
and apparently she used to be
a player of the nose flute,
which we have someone in our crew Joan
who brought a nose
flute we're gonna see if
maybe we can cheer her up a little bit,
and spend some quality time with somebody
who is a little bit sad.
(laughing)
It's gone now.
(calm music)
Good, woo!
Is that new?
You have a tattoo?
Wow!
It's beautiful.
(speaking in foreign language)
No?
She's a champ.
This one
(speaking in foreign language)
What'd she say?
What does that (mumbles) mean?
Ugly?
She says it's ugly!
(laughing)
So with Joan's nose flute,
and my tattoos, which she called ugly,
it seemed to have cracked the
sadness veil a little bit,
and now we are joking around.
While she might not be tattooing today,
which is totally fine,
this is the kind of
experience that in my opinion,
is worth more than tattooing.
(speaking in foreign language)
(laughing)
- She doesn't like having sex.
(laughing)
You got a big one?
- Did she ask me if I had a big penis?
Oh my god I'm so embarrassed right now.
(laughing)
Is that what she said?
She measured it and she said it was small?
My penis is like what?
It's like that big?
No it's bigger than that,
keep going keep going, it's this big.
That's how big it is.
(laughing)
Well Joan, I have to say your nose flute,
I think I made fun of it
the first time I saw it
a couple days ago, saved the day today.
Appa Whang Od had not played it or seen
a nose flute in a long time.
- Been a long time, yes.
- And so bringing it out,
definitely was the key
to a beautiful experience.
- And you need experience.
- She's a human being too,
and she's hilarious actually,
she's hilarious.
(children laughing)
(speaking in foreign language)
- [Woman] It's a
traditional Kalinga tattoo.
- [Mike] And what is her name?
- [Woman] Luk Ja.
- [Mike] Luk Ja.
(speaking in foreign language)
How old is she?
(speaking in foreign language)
- 80.
- 80.
(speaking in foreign language)
- 90.
Can you tell her that I think
they are very beautiful?
(speaking in foreign language)
So beautiful.
- [Woman] I was asking
her what's the meaning
of the tattoo.
And she said it's for
like to attract guys.
- Did it work?
(laughing)
(speaking in foreign language)
- [Woman] Yeah for them,
it's beautiful if you
have a lot of tattoos.
- [Woman] She's asking what's your name?
- My name is Mike.
- Mike.
- Mike.
(speaking in foreign language)
- Mike and Luk Ja best friends forever.
(speaking in foreign language)
- La la la la la.
(laughing)
- Thank you.
- Okay so now the next morning,
and we are returning to
Appa Whang Od's house
to get the signature Appa Whang Od's
no longer doing full tattoos.
Because after 60 years of going like this,
you get some Arthritis.
She has stopped last year unfortunately,
but she is still doing the signature
which is her three dots.
So if you're coming here to get a tattoo,
you have to wait in line to
get your three dot signature,
and then you can go to
one of her granddaughters,
to be able to get one of
the full Kalinga tattoos.
So when it's our turn, we are
gonna grab our signature first
and then go see her granddaughter after.
(calm music)
Okay, we're learning a few things here,
as we're watching others get
tattooed by Appa Whang Od,
she uses the same needle from
person to person, to person.
People bring needles, we have needles,
the thorns right here, but
she's refused every needle,
every thorn that's been brought for her
that we've seen.
She's an artist, she
wants to use the tools
that she's comfortable
with, and so same needle,
seems to be used for every single person.
(people talking)
(speaking in foreign language)
So I'm getting a signature tattoo,
before getting my other
tattoo from Whang Od,
and I have to shave where
she's going to do it.
Finish?
- Finish.
(speaking in foreign language)
(laughing)
- You remember me, yeah?
Thank you Appa Whang Od.
(speaking in foreign language)
I can't really see it,
what's going on back there?
- [Woman] I see three
dots, and they're red.
- Oh there's a lot of blood.
She's such a hilarious,
sweet and mischievous lady,
I didn't expect that actually.
(speaking in foreign language)
- [Woman] How many hours?
- What's your design?
- The scorpion.
They're saying it looks
like the Wi-Fi symbol,
which might also be appropriate
for what I do for work.
Whenever I get a tattoo,
my heart always goes
like this a little bit.
So I've always gotten tattoos,
when I'm going through something
powerful in my life and
changing something important.
I picked a scorpion
because it means courage,
and just change the
name from Kick The Grind
to Feels and Fire.
So I thought this is the perfect way to
bring in the occasion.
It's amazing they use a
thorn from a Pamello tree,
like the big oranges,
and the ink is just the
charcoal of pine trees,
and with that mellow thorn, and the ashes,
they can make a tattoo
that lasts a long time.
The three dots is
actually very interesting,
the three dots mean her,
and the two other official
tattoo artists here in the city which are
her two granddaughters,
is Gracia and Elyang.
And so that's why there's three dots,
the only three official tattoo
artists here in Buscalan.
(speaking in foreign language)
Looking good.
- Coconut oil.
- Okay I'm back in the hotel room,
I am sunburnt, I am dirty, and I'm inked.
I am really happy that I got to have some
intimate time with Whang Od,
not everybody gets to do that,
especially not anymore now that she's 101,
and it was really special I
left feeling really happy,
really appreciative, and really violated.
But that's fine, I mean
what am I suppose to do?
She is a 101 year old ex
head hunter tattoo artist,
am I gonna call the cops?
No, just kinda have to
roll with it I guess but,
it's a helluva souvenir to have, isn't it?
