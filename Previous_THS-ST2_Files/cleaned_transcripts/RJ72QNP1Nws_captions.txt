have a bread machine here so let us have
a look at the ingredients and mix them

sugar and also 7 grams of instant yeast
I will also add 50 grams of softened
butter
and one whole egg
Dutch weather again so raining sunshine

make it but anyway let's go to the
flour this is
a Japanese flour Japanese bread flour
to make the bread really soft Pogi is
waiting for the pandesal. Pogi you like pandesal?
so let's put it in I'm using 400 grams
of course you can also use all-purpose
flour with this recipe
there's the Sun again so finally I'm
gonna add five grams of salt
sea salt
okay that should be it for the pandesal
mixture so I'm gonna add this to
the bread making machine I'm gonna turn
it on the dough setting its gonna make a
dough and it will rise, it will ferment
later we're gonna chop it up in smaller
pieces

take out the dough has been two hours
first one and a half hour and then
afterwards mix it again and another half

gonna quickly bring this inside maybe
not all became the same size somewhere a
bit smaller than others but doesn't
matter so much you're gonna let it rest
for about 20 minutes and then put it in
the oven
