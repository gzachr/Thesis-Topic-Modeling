SAINT OUEN IS NEAR TO PARIS
I'M ON VACATIONS FOR A MONTH
I'M REALLY HAPPY TI BE IN FRANCE
AND MAKING VIDEOS FROM HERE
BACK TO THE TOPIC
WHEN I TRAVEL OVERSEAS
WHAT I TRY TO DAY IS TO LOOK FOR CERTAIN COMMUNITIES
WHAT I DO IS SEARCHING AND USING INTERNET
AND I TRY TO COMMUNITIES LIKE THE DANCE ,
OR MUSIC
I SEARCH IF PEOPLE DO DANCE FOR INSTANCE
EVENT ORGANIZERS
MUSIC ETC...
THAT'S WHAT I OFTEN DO WHEN I GO ON VACATIONS
IT ALSO DEPENDS WHERE
BUT MOST OF THE TIME , I LIKE TO SEE BEOFRE GOING
THERE ARE AREA WHERE PEOPLE PRACTICE
OR WHERE PEOPLE DO MUSIC
I MEET EVERYTIME A LOT OF PEOPLE AND FRIENDS
SO IN THE PHILIPPINES
I DID SOME RESEARCH ONLINE
AND I SAW THAT IN CEBU THERE WERE PEOPLE WHO DO BREAKDANCE
I JUST REACHED THEM
AND I MET SOMEONE
WHO INTRODUCED ME TO OTHER PEOPLE
I HAD THE CHANCE TO MEET THOSE PEOPLE
IN CEBU
I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRACTICE WITH THEM
ON DAY
WHAT'S HAPPEND IS THAT THEY INVITED ME TO PRACTICE WITH THEM
SO I WHEN TO PRACTICE WITH THEM
I SAW WHERE THEIR PRACTICE SPOTS
WE TALKED A LOT
I WAS ASKING THEM A LOT OF QUESTIONS
ABOUT THE LIFE IN THE PHILIPPINES
THE LIFE IN CEBU
AND THEY WERE ALSO VERY CURIOUS TO KNOW
HOW WE LIVE IN FRANCE
AND FOR MYSELF IN CANADA
THE DANCERS I MET  GAVE ME ADVICES
THEY SHOWED ME AROUND
BY MOTOR BIKE
 
THEY SHOWED ME AREA WHERE I COULD EAT
CHEAP PLACES
THINGS TO DO AND THINGS TO NOT DO
WHEN I WAS TAKING TAXI FOR EXAMPLE
THEY BROUGHT ME SOMEWHERE WHERE THEY WERE A LOT OF THINGS
A BIG SPORTS COMPLEX
THEY WERE PEOPLE DOING SPORTS
AND I SAW SOME KIDS  DANCING
I PRACTICED WITH THE DANCERS
WE DID CYPHERS ETC..
I SAW BUCH OF KIDS
WHO WERE PRACTICING TOO
HONESTLY , SOMETHING GOOD HAPPENED
THE KIDS CAME
BY CURIOSITY
THEY LOOKED AT BE VERY CURIOUSLY
THEN I HAD THT CHANCE TO GIVE THEM A DANCE WORKSHOP
