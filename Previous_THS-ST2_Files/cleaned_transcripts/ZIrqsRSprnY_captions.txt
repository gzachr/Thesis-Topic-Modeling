and blue and green saturated Island  
of Cebu so come along with me today as we'd Spore 
the city of Cebu see some amazing churches and old  
sites dive deep into the Spanish history that was 
once colonized here in the 16th century come along  
with me as I share my thoughts there hasn't been 
a place where I've seen statues of this detail and  
just explore the Good Vibes here we also meet 
some local kids along the way Swimming by the  
ocean and also playing some basketball where we 
have a chat and have a few laughs has its pros  
and cons so let's go check it out we also goes to 
some sights and Exhibits that you may recognize so  
come along with me today as we dive deep into 
this city and let's have a whole load of fun
so let's get this adventure started 
with some strange activities interesting  
it and a little bit of accidental Mischief 
that we realized we were in a wedding  
so g'day and good morning guys we are 
currently in Cebu City so this video  
today is going to be my first impressions of 
this city we're currently out the front of a  
church that was built in the 1500s and rebuilt 
in the 1700s and is very famous for the baby  
Jesus statue this church is called binsilica di 
sentio I hope I'm saying that right there is a  
lot of Spanish words here in the Philippines 
so come along with me and let's check it out
foreign
foreign
Australia I've been to a lot of churches before 
and seen a lot of different statues of Jesus and  
and Mary and everything like that but there 
hasn't been a place where I've seen statues  
of this detail and um and like a church 
like this intense like it almost feels like  
um how the Buddhist religion represents their 
statues of Buddha this place is very statue  
orientated and has really lovely features in the 
church so it's really refreshing and and a nice  
thing to see it's very different to any church 
that I've been into so I'm glad I can share that  
with you guys today so that's really interesting 
the lighting of candles I've seen that a lot on  
my travels in the Hindu religion but not so much 
in Christianity um maybe it's more of a Catholic  
tradition and religious practice I myself when I 
was in Australia I went to a lot more Anglican or  
Baptist Churches so I haven't really seen 
it that often but it really cool to see
thank you
so I hope you enjoyed the original cross that 
was brought here by the Spaniards and also the  
church so now we're going to go to an Old 
Fort so come along with me and let's go
I'll tell you what it is hot here in Cebu 
today blue skies and hot so make sure if you  
come to Cebu be prepared it's going to be hot 
sunscreen hat sunglasses I have all of these  
in my bag don't worry I'll put my sunscreen on 
for today man oh man it is hot here sweating
so we were just walking to the fort and we came 
across this bridge it reminds me of the Anzac  
bridge in Australia I tried to look on Google 
Maps what the name of this bridge was for you  
guys but I couldn't find it on Google Maps 
so if you know what this bridge is called let  
me know in the comments just being invited 
by some local people to come and say hello
how are you hmm what's your name what's your name
nice to meet you my name is Jack  
yeah yeah what's your name Kobe nice Ryan Ryan 
what's your name mom nice to meet you okay see you
again so we're just outside of the 
fort San Pedro this fort was built  
in 1738 and I just bought a uh lemon 
juice off this local Street Vander here  
it was only 50 pesos which is about 
a dollar 25 so let's give this a try
oh this is good wow so it's using real lemon 
juice probably water and maybe a little bit of  
sugar but the Sugar's not overpowering for 
50 pesos on a hot day like this you can't  
complain so come along with me be right 
beside me as we'd Spore Fort San Pedro
today was only 30 pesos each so that's 
just under one dollar I find that extremely  
affordable so I definitely recommend 
coming here first impressions though is  
this is really really cool a lot better than 
Fort San Diego in condition wise when we saw  
it in Manila but I think both hazards 
pros and cons so let's go check it out
thank you Oh Baby don't cry don't cry cause 
there's no way but tomorrow yeah oh if I could  
fly I would be with you every second of my life 
well check out these tray just here the root  
system is like all like weird and like mangely 
I've never seen a tree like that before that's  
cool so not only is this a historical thought it's 
also a almost Museum and public garden that's free  
to enter in the garden and then obviously when 
you come into the fort area it's 30 pesos but  
this whole Garden area behind me is completely 
free in a nice Green Space to come as well
so I just walked into the top building 
here of the fort and there's all these  
old vintage bikes and I'm thinking what 
does this have to do with the fort but  
the Cebu vintage bike club leaves 
their bikes here to have on display
so when you're trying to film a vlog you want 
to avoid copyright music like this I don't know  
what's going on here in Cebu but there might be 
a concert later on tonight it's very relaxing I  
tell you when you're trying to walk around 
a lovely old forts in the garden it's super  
relaxing wow so all of these paintings 
tell the story of when the Spaniards came  
to the Philippines it's that's really 
interesting if you get time pause the  
section where I show the information and you 
can have a little read okay so that was Fort  
San Pedro done now we're heading to 
the ancestral old house so let's go
a truck full of tuk-tuks 
you don't say that every day
thank you
foreign
thing you have to watch out for when you're in 
Asia is the power lines if you see any power lines  
lying on the ground like that do not go near it 
I actually knew someone who once told me that his  
friend got struck by one of the power lines on the 
on the footpath and yeah didn't turn out too great
foreign
some lovely local kids I love that that 
kid could speak really good English he  
was only in grade five which means he's 
about 10 or 11 fluid English wow so cool
yep sentigo and Central house is among one 
of the country's oldest residential homes in  
the Philippines built around 1680 from wood and 
coral Stone it's designed combining Spanish and  
Chinese architectural influences is a very 
interesting and also creepy place to visit
place is extremely old like you can feel the 
creaks when you're walking wow this is so cool  
all the artwork and the photos of Jesus and the it 
sort of gives you like your grandma's house Vibes  
type thing that oh well I've just walked into 
the bedroom this is a little bit spooky as well  
you know like those old houses that like are 
a little bit scary and spooky I wouldn't want  
to walk through here at night so we just 
came to the outside area and this is a  
lot nicer than what I expected wow it's very 
tranquilic and they even have an old well too  
these are actually the original drawings 
and paintings of the old house on the  
street back when it was built wow that's 
really really cool to preserve history
okay so we are now in Cebu Metropolitan Cathedral 
so come along with me and let's check out this one
okay so Matt and I went to sit down and it 
wasn't until five minutes into the service  
that we realized we were in a wedding 
the bride and groom got up into the  
center and I looked and I thought oh that 
looks like a wedding dress well it was  
so I mean if you see this anyone who was 
there my apologies we did sit in the back  
and then once we realized we left but um it was 
also something really nice to see so thank you  
so right now we're in Cebu City Center so let's 
walk around here and see what there is to offer
foreign
clothing market so these these clothes 
are really cheap like three pieces for  
a hundred a hundred for a button-up shirt uh 
50 for short so yeah let's have a little look
so much for joining us on our journey 
around Cebu I hope that you felt to be  
right beside me join me in the next

one I'm really excited for it as
