we're the Lockwoods and we're traveling the 
world to experience up close and in person  
all the natural wonders and distinct cultures 
that our kids would otherwise be consuming  
only through textbooks and TV after just two 
months since our last visit to the Philippines  
our appreciation for this beautiful country 
has brought us back and we're starting our  
adventures off here in Bonifacio Global City BGC 
is the modern counterpoint to the centuries-old  
Chinatown culture that we experienced in Metro 
Manila the last time we were here there are  
dozens of must-see must-do activities in this 
family-friendly City but since we're only here  
for two short days before beginning a week 
of Philippines island hopping we're going to  
spend some time with a few new friends let's 
get to it all right we're starting off here  
in our hotel or really a residence that will 
give you a tour of later this is Raffles and  
we're meeting up with a couple of really cool 
locals that we've been talking to online and  
they're going to take us out for an entire day of 
adventure some of their favorite places they've  
even gotten us a van so we're gonna jump in now 
and we're gonna start exploring they brought us  
little breakfast treats it's kind of a dessert 
breakfast treat and this one is a tart what kind  
of tart is it Buko tart and so it's a coconut 
flavor which I love just like a coconut pie  
I thought it was going to be crumbly but it's 
very soft very good perfect breakfast [Music]  
we are at the Manila American cemetery and 
Memorial this was established in 1948 it was  
dedicated in 1960 and it's really a tribute to all 
of the American soldiers and a lot of Filipinos  
who died or were missing after World War II now it 
may seem a little bit strange to have an American  
war memorial in the Philippines but the reason for 
that besides the fact that these Americans died  
here or were missing here is that during World 
War II the Japanese occupied the Philippines and  
the Americans were fundamental in driving them 
out by the end of the war Colt can you guess how  
many gravestones there are here 26000 is a good 
guess and it's sort of in the middle there are 17000  
gravestones here but there are also 36000  names on plaques for the missing the  
people who were never found so every one of 
these names are the people who are missing in  
action however they have found the remains of 
some of them and those people are designated  
with the little badge right here next to them so 
if you see any of these it means they have found  
them and technically they wouldn't belong on the 
missing boards anymore they would be buried out  
under one of the Cross tombstones I'm really 
surprised with how beautifully maintained the  
whole place is there are over 150 acres and 
it is just pristinely landscaped and you can  
see people working all over the place and it just 
shows you the level of respect that they have for  
this Memorial here and it's humbling to see this 
many people who sacrificed their lives service is
service is really important to our family so 
we want to thank everybody who has served in  
our home country and in others and say thank 
you thank you thank you for your service what  
a humbling start to our day it is beautiful 
here and our next stop is very very close by
we're in Venice Italy no the Philippines we 
are at the Venice canals here in BGC and it  
feels like we're in Italy obviously you can do a 
gondola ride we've done this in Las Vegas where  
they have a very similar mall and obviously 
that's the experience that you would have if  
you did this in Venice Italy they're decorating 
for Chinese New Year which is on the 21st coming  
up this Saturday for us and this shopping center 
is surrounded by high-rise corporate buildings  
where a huge percentage of international call 
center work is outsourced so if you're calling  
your bank credit card companies Hewlett-Packard 
for computer support there's a very good chance  
that it's being routed right here this is very 
different from our last trip to Manila that was  
an older side of Manila where we went to bonando 
Chinatown and we stayed next to the Mall of Asia  
right on the water and this is much more of 
a metropolitan area very posh very stylish  
so two different worlds in one city but we're 
getting a it hungry yeah so we're jumping back  
in the van and heading south of town to try one 
of acones and tells favorite restaurants but it  
takes a while to get here it's about an hour 
drive outside of Manila we're in tagatai way  
to grab a little lunch here at balai Taco 
which means big house and it's overlooking  
something very incredible for the area it's a 
really popular place we hear that no trip to  
tagatai is complete unless you come here oledako 
also has a deli and a bakery and they're well  
known for their muscovado filled unleavened 
flatbread that they make out in the open
so we just got a fresh plaque 
we're gonna try them now
oh yeah it is hot so the jelly inside that 
quote's talking about it's like a coconut  
jam that's inside these are yummy I'm burning my 
fingers people don't only come here for the food  
they come here for the views as well we're perched 
up really high almost 2000 feet above sea level  
and we have this phenomenal view of volcano 
and it erupts every I think 10 years and it  
had its eruption in 2020 so we're safe for now 
but every now and then are those few some ash or  
have a little steam come up it's a beautiful day 
to look at it today we've got quite the spread  
here there's green beans with okra eggplant and 
a little bit of pork grilled fish and the star is  
bone marrow soup and the fish is called Pompano 
and you can only get it here and it was caught  
right over there in that Little Bay Area and what 
would a great meal be without the dessert now I  
want to thank all of our followers and commenters 
and who told us we had to try hollow hollow when  
we're back in the Philippines we are back and 
I am so grateful you told us to try it because  
now that's what we're gonna have if you're not 
familiar with Halo Halo it means mix so it's  
basically a hodgepodge of a bunch of different 
wonderful sugary sweet desserts there's Ube ice  
cream I know that's always involved in vanilla ice 
cream these beans mung beans and then these like  
jelly filled beans we have we have a lot of them 
in Thailand also and the red ones are jellies and  
the little yellow thing that is leche and then 
they pour the milk on top of it you mix it all  
together oh it's so cold the mug beans create a 
really great texture for it the Ube ice cream is  
super it's Uber very delicious and tons of coconut 
and there's little Crunchies on there too this is  
worth the hype I understand why you all love 
it so much all the milk makes it a lot better  
there's one more dessert we need to show you and 
it is a Filipino Christmas delicacy and it is
steamed and it rolled up and then there's coconut 
flakes and a raw brown sugar and then over here  
is cheese so a little bit of those ingredients 
all together I see how all those flavors come  
together the Ube has like a buttery taste to 
it it's like when you chew it like on a butter  
it kind of comes out and then the coconut of 
course coconut all of that together really  
really delicious I understand why people want 
to celebrate Christmas with it I'm glad you  
guys like this without a doubt the best Filipino 
food I've ever had but we're gonna try to make it  
back into Manila here before traffic gets too bad 
because the traffic in Manila is unreal [Music]  
foreign [Applause] Manila this time we wanted 
to stay in BGC so we're at the Raffles Makati  
and that is part of the Fairmont Hotel we 
have a studio bedroom but it's really big  
and the bathroom's really big too so we're 
plenty comfortable and we're only here for  
two nights which means we have to pack a lot 
into the two days and we're off on our next  
little activity well despite our best efforts 
to Beat the Traffic last night we did not it  
took us several hours to get back into BGC but 
here we are in a brand new day and we're going  
to meet up with mom duty another YouTuber 
family from California and they've been  
living here for a couple of months we're going 
to experience the Mine Museum right here foreign
and their two kids Mia and Knox and they're the 
same age as Colt and Brooklyn so they're getting  
to know each other I know I love it they're 
playing with other kids finally it's really  
exciting I'm so glad we got something I did too it 
was last minute that we connected and we happened  
to be in the same city it's amazing that we're 
both traveling families and we were able to be  
in the same city at the same time what are the 
chances it's crazy amazing so we're gonna let  
the kids play around for a bit get to know each 
other which didn't take long they're actually all  
best friends they're best friends it's so cute 
they like have nicknames for each other super  
sweet they're at a science museum so they are 
gonna learn and play and uh just have a blast  
and they're like the only ones here we're the 
only ones here so we basically have this whole  
museum for ourselves bloggers day yeah this is 
the space section of the museum but everything  
is very immersive in education know but I think 
our kids are all finding new ways creative ways to  
use everything in here like just pushing all the 
buttons or kicking all the balls around the place  
it's incredible how much they have in common it's 
like Bizarro world where our families have so many  
tie-ins I mean from having homes in California 
before our love for the Philippines and the ages  
of the kids the interests of the kids and just 
a general approach to why we're living this way  
traveling the world and trying to give our kids 
a different experience it's really crazy to talk  
to them because it's just complete Synergy it's 
awesome this is actually our first collab and it's  
their first collab but it's not just the kids 
who have a lot in common I notice that you're  
carrying the big camera in the family is that this 
is I'm the videographer I'm the videographer and  
Peak design oh no way I didn't even notice that 
Peak design and I have the Peak Travel tripod  
you don't have one of these do you I do oh it's 
the other one too I have I have too many of them  
another thing we have in common is we're the same 
height yeah turns out we're not the only ones in  
the museum all day more people eventually came 
in and we're heading out we're gonna check out  
what's around this area and we have got to try 
a jollibeez we have had outpouring of comments  
telling us that we have to try Jolly bees and it's 
gonna be our first time since this is our first  
time I have to get the crispy chicken sandwich now 
crispy chicken sandwiches at fast food restaurants  
is kind of a big deal in the U.S so we have a 
little bit of a comparison with it and we'll see  
how jollibee's does I'm expecting big things here 
I'm thinking ooe one of everything but I gotta try  
the tuna pie I have a feeling that's a pretty 
famous thing here gotta try a Yum Burger just  
to see how it compares to a typical McDonald's 
cheeseburger and of course the chicken sandwich
fast friends I love it I really hope that we 
stay in touch with everybody but especially I  
hope those girls keep in touch because they're 
gonna be friends forever I think that's their  
handshake it's the longest handshake this 
is the moment of truth I'm like nervous  
and excited because everybody has worked up this 
sandwich so much I don't want to be disappointed  
oh Byron's blessing it is blessing because 
that's sauce is that a mayonnaise or it's like  
got a mustardy taste to it too but it's delicious 
I'm really digging the sauce and it's got garlic  
I think in it too really yummy and the chicken 
is really crispy and this is a winner compared  
to the U.S chicken sandwiches Jolly bees takes it 
for sure because of the crispiness and the sauce  
done and then let's talk about the bun The Bun 
buttery and delicious of all fast food restaurants  
on Earth this is the one that you should go it's 
back over time for the tuna pie same packaging  
the old McDonald's pies the dessert pies cherry 
pies apple pies it's basically a little hot pocket  
let's see if it's scalding hot like those things 
it's exactly the same shape as a cherry pie from  
McDonald's [Applause] all right that's pretty good 
I think this was one of those places that reuses  
a lot of the same ingredients from one dish to 
another because I think it's the same sauce from  
the chicken sandwich that's mixed in with the tuna 
inside of here is the flakiest crunchiest shell  
imaginable I could eat some of these this is good 
enough food for us it's time for some drinks the  
adults are thirsty and Melvin has got a place to 
take us here what is your favorite animal you've  
ever come across during your travel dogs Awesome 
Brooklyn what about you remember that lemur that  
we held oh yes Knox we have a question for you 
all your travels what is your favorite animal  
that you've come across it's a hard one let me 
think let me think okay I got it a couple cats  
in Cappadocia there's a lot of cats there it's 
actually one of the cat capitals what about you  
that I've ever come across from um the first 
time I ever saw a toke gecko since Rocio and  
Melvin have been here for a while they're pretty 
much locals they're gonna show us around a little  
bit before we get that drink we've been promised 
and this is the famous High Street which is like a  
pedestrian Mall covered in shopping restaurants 
unfortunately we're not going to spend a lot  
of time here but it was on our list to do that 
because they've got some fantastic restaurants  
and really high-end Brands and I heard there's 
a Michelin star food court that is right up our  
alley so if we had more time we would do that so 
when we come back that's going to be on the list  
to do this is one of the very few 4D Billboards on 
the planet they have them in Manhattan they have  
them I think in Tokyo I don't know where else but 
when you look at it from the right angle across  
the street here it's really hard to understand 
that you're not looking into a three-dimensional  
room or seeing things pop out of the billboard 
it's incredible this is nuts it's gonna blow  
your mind because it's really blowing my mind 
about how similar our kids are the girls are  
like the same person and the boys also they love 
catching lizards and you're not going to believe  
that Knox also loves to taste wine which is crazy 
because how do we find two of them he's taking us  
to Mr wine Dr wine Dr wine delectable it's nice 
to ride case full body yeah I love it let's see
