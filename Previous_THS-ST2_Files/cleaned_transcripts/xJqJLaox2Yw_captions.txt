Good morning from El Nido here 
in the Philippines beautiful day. 
Sunny blue skies and that's exactly what we 
need because this boat is ours for the day  
me and Dad have rented it out for the entire 
day uh I literally just got out here we need  
to go rent some gear we're going to meet all 
the crew apparently there's chefs and stuff  
and you know tons of walk I tripped over 
the sand tons of crew on board and we're  
going to be exploring all the islands here in 
the Philippines in El Nido so apparently dad's  
vlogging as well we uh we need to get some 
flippers and some snorkels oh no thank you
thank you snorkels and some goggles how's that 
oh that feels good yeah 100 pesos really really  
good all right let's get into it and do 
we need snorkel as well you have already  
no we don't okay so you should uh we need 
snorkels yeah have you got them I've got  
the fins please okay oh these look cool 
well these like the full face ones which  
one is which one's better for me I do recommend this this one yes really these look cool though  
actually it seems but I do recommend this one 
that one all right yeah we'll go with those two  
Perfect all right guys a little bit of a frantic 
morning but we're making our way onto the boat
and we got Ryan right your name we got 
Ryan with us today he'll be the tour guide  
so where where are we going today what 
islands what lagoons actually we're going  
to tour a actually tour a that is the five 
different stuff so that is the Big Lagoon  
secret lagoon island even seven Commando 
Beach wow so water places that we'll be  
visiting and this is the bike not the bike 
this is the boat I just walked up this uh  
little stepladder here and this is all ours 
for the day guys so I'll get into logistics uh  
in a little bit once we get sorted telling you 
how much it costs and everything like that but  
this is gonna be awesome let's uh go for a quick 
little tour because these things are so cool we'll  
walk around we've got kayaks on the side here this is like a traditional Filipino boat they have all  
these kind of like long arms that kind of help the 
buoyancy and whatnot but here we go we've got the  
chef's uh area we've got the captain we obviously have Ryan as well um but oh I'm excited literally  
the number one thing you need to do in the 
Philippines when you're here in El Nido is go on  
an island hopping tour so as Ryan said we're going to be doing tour a today uh which consists of five  
or so things and we literally have this boat uh 
the whole day it's around eight o'clock right now  
and we have it until like 6 p.m so we can stay 
however long we want at whatever Islands we  
want we can do whatever we want and that is the glory of booking these things all for yourself  
but it does come at a cost which I'll get to 
shortly of course I can swim though is that okay
I'm a good swimmer yeah 
it's only here yeah perfect  
A little life vest so this is a traditional 
boat Ryan it's like Philip only in the  
Philippines yes only in the Philippines and 
how long have they been like this kind of  
um this kind of boat like hundreds of years or 
actually I have no idea but since the tourists  
started uh late 1980s so that is the beginning 
of this uh you know doing this yeah very good  
wow it's cool and hopefully the weather will 
be yeah hopefully the weather it looks good now  
bit of blue skies a bit of clouds over there but 
as you know the weather here in the Philippines  
can change immediately like like literally 
just like that it could be torrential so  
let's hope for uh for the best weather today 
as we're out but luckily we got this kind of  
uh area here in case it does get rainy we 
can see cover we got this area in here I  
just love all like the traditional things 
like this is what I love hello sir hello  
yeah good you what is your job today 
you are a crew or you're a chef  
oh very good so what food do we have today 
um pork chicken oh all the goodies yeah
fish eggplants yeah oh is that what 
what fish is that it is oh snapper  
mango snapper very good and we 
can even do some fishing today  
yeah maybe and we'll catch uh we'll 
catch our own fish to cook for dinner
all right let's uh get this show on the road this  
is the captain for today what is 
your name sir Vincent so you're
How many years have you been driver or Captain for so five years so you're an expert very very good  
all right hopefully we get there safely and uh 
the final poster to introduce today is obviously  
my father dad he is uh he's here for the trip 
filming in the Philippines so we'll be out  
exploring what are you most excited about today oh man just getting out again exploring the islands  
uh you know I love nature and we're actually got a great day which are really boringly excited about  
but I want to find some of those uh secluded 
locations where other people can't get to yeah
but um I'm just also I want your company 
too it's something that we enjoy each  
other's company a lot and it's not a 
good opportunity to get out there just  
you and I to have a great day all right 
I agree well let's make it great okay
Let's go, let's go!
off we go everybody we're leaving El Nido 
beach we're off to explore some more beaches  
but yeah it's just so good having your own private boat so I'll get into the logistics uh this is  
costing us um 12 500 pesos so a lot of the other 
tour companies that we were looking into they  
only do like per person and there's like 20 or so 
people stuff tons of tourists and stuff like that  
so we were like you know what we want to be able to explore we want to have the freedom to go to  
whatever Islands we want we can stay there however long we want we can do whatever we want and  
of course we get to have you know a really good 
time with a small knit crew you know we've got  
Ryan we've got all the crew up there we've got 
the captain and uh when it's just us we can have  
a really good time with the boys to explore all of 
El Nido but this is kind of the main area where a  
lot of these boats get picked up on so if you were to do uh like a tour here I think it's around 1600  
pesos per person so around like 30 or so dollars 
but they usually pick you up from these little  
docking areas here so apparently around nine 
o'clock is when it gets really busy because that's  
when all the tours start so we decided to leave 
a little bit early 8 A.M we'll get out there skip  
all the crowds and get the best spots first of 
course we have it for the whole day as well but um
I'm excited the water is just like turquoise it's 
such a beautiful color I'm sure we're going to  
be seeing tons of wildlife tons of fish 
maybe even turtles some sharks who knows
I'm excited guys it's good it's good to be on the  
water you can't come to El Nido and 
not do a boat tour so let's do it
oh you can even climb up here I'm not 
sure if they'll be too happy if I climb up
All right here's the roof everybody.
I don't want to really fall but you gotta 
risk it wow look at that view behind me the  
limestone rocks that are famous here in El Nido 
I just want to jump off it looks so refreshing  
so refreshing the water it just 
looks absolutely gorgeous but wowie
all right there's a couple 
waves coming let's watch out
everybody we're making our 
way through hello
there's another tour that's either beginning 
they're coming in but we're really making our  
way out we've been driving for about 10 minutes 
out of El Nido town and there's some really  
beautiful beaches oh we're going over some waves here a little bit choppy a little bit choppy I'm
holding on I'm holding on but over on the left 
there we go beautiful beaches and the water
here is really deep so it's super dark blue but 
over on the coast obviously it's a lot shallower  
and the turquoise like water just looks 
beautiful I can't wait until we're in like  
the secret lagoon all those big lagoons and 
the water is just like crystal clear but this  
is absolutely gorgeous the limestone it actually 
reminds me a lot of uh Thailand like Phi Phi Island
I've been in South South East Asia the past couple of months I was in Vietnam I was obviously here as  
well I was in Thailand and they have some really 
similar geography obviously there's so many  
different unique traits about each and every one 
of them but one thing that is very similar is the  
geography they have these just massive limestone rocks they're just absolutely tower over the rest  
of the country and it really is beautiful 
but yeah it's just such a gorgeous day it  
literally couldn't have gotten a better day it's 
not too hot it's not too sunny but it's not rainy  
so it's literally I reckon the perfect conditions 
to be out on the water what are you doing
That's my job what are you doing that's my job
This is the first stop yes so this is what 
we call Seven Commandos seven commandos wow  
You're going to ask me why they call 
this Seven Commando so 1980s actually  
um there was a boat on that spot that they damaged the floral garden there oh and then  
they'll lead the management resources confiscated that boat so that's why they renamed this place  
so Seven Commando is derived from that boat
the original boat yes yes sir but the original  
name of this island is because uh 80 percent 
of the the uh the tree up there is e field  
Ipil yeah if you know that is only 
endemic in the Philippines that kind of yeah  
and we're literally the first one 
here guys that's the that's the glory  
of having your own private boat and being 
able to get here early here we go wow
oh there's even monkeys hey there's a monkey 
a monkey there's two oh oh no during usually  
this would be busy it's because we're early yeah 
so usually there's lots of boats here yeah maybe  
10 10 a.m wow there's too many boat now here but we have it all to ourselves awesome yeah all right  
let's jump over here I'm gonna I'm gonna flip down and then jump oh no you're gonna jump on you oh  
all right oh here we are Seven Commando beach wow look at this one is this a is this a restaurant
fresh beer Coke chips for sale
Here's the swimming area everybody 
wow this is just absolutely gorgeous  
we literally have it all to ourselves 
it's crazy but it's just so remote like  
literally look at that guys in the middle 
of the ocean on a little dotted Island
The Seven Commandos beach here are 
the rules oh come on surely they  
could have had seven they could have added 
one more just to fit the uh the beach name  
seven commands seven rules so no stepping on 
the coral no stirring the sediment no touching  
or chasing marine life no gloves that's an 
interesting one no feeding fish and no littering
but look at this here there's some 
people doing sculptures or they've  
done sculptures here oh they even have 
volleyball look at these volleyball nets
there's a couple over there you got to make sure  
you're picking up the volleyball 
and not the coconut but would also
all right
Are you ready to see greatness everybody
Take two take two we'll go from this side
that was a great one that was a 
great serve I aced them ready yep
all right go on the other side pot plant food  
don't make me run into the 
coconut tree prepare to lose
out oh no that was in that was out well okay 
it was out even though we've got no markers  
we're on minimized court minimize minimize 
court because because I hit it too hard
oh no oh that's out that's out one one
oh two one
three one
three two
yeah the trick is just to get 
it over you can't be doing
I'm choking three three
oh no out
Match point next point
and it didn't make it oh my God please stop 
being stupid you gotta win by two right yeah
oh that's gonna be in I'll let you have it hey
you got to give them a little 
bit of hope because he's old  
make them feel like they're gonna win and 
at the end just go for it oh that's snooky
oh no yeah
he's tight enough no I think it's six five 
your way ah oh yeah just six white figure
oh what a shot oh God that was great 
placement in the corner pocket
Bingo
I didn't mean to do such a dodgy shot 
but let's go let's go over yeah playing  
one person probably should turn it 
off seven six huh match point okay
oh no no no
don't mess with the champ don't mess with the 
champ I'm sweating already I need to go for a  
swim luckily there's plenty of ocean 
to do just that let's grab this ball
Ryan's calling us over monkey
oh yeah
look at him
wow
there's like a family of 
them there's one guy there  
and there's a couple more 
there's a baby one up in the tree
do they eat coconuts yeah this is seems 
like this oh the monkey did that really  
wow oh there's a bug in there 
as well do they attack sometimes
real Michael Jordan yeah Chicago 
Bulls and this is how you dunk  
no I'm not going to be able to dunk but 
I'll hit a three-pointer on the island here
maybe not
cut that cut that smell good it's not 
really not that good at basketball as well
the slam dunk oh yes and he's 
got it he's done and he's done it  
it's so good having this place all to yourself 
usually there'd just be so many tourists here  
it kind of you know when I was traveling a lot 
during covert I've noticed a difference from now  
in all the places I've been to it's uh it's so 
much busier but this brings back the old times  
the times in 2021 when I was traveling the 
world having every tourist site everywhere  
completely to myself and this is just absolutely 
incredible wow look at that bird all right
so I'm gonna we're gonna use 
yourself we might as well get along  
film recorded how are you gonna go it 
hurts so much these are like social  
yeah wow he's funny too sharp this 
tree oh lucky I didn't jump in oh yeah
so chuck that there and we'll go for a quick dip 
it's been fun on this island I'm sweating like  
crazy it's so humid but perfect way to finish off 
a visit here at the seven Commandos Beach oh wow
this water is incredible
now I'm feeling refreshed boy oh boy 
so we're right by the boat here so I  
have these bamboo sticks right  it 
kind of adds extra buoyancy on either side  
because you can imagine if you didn't have 
this here you'd just be gone with that  
a little bit of surface area through all the 
ocean and through all the waves luckily it's  
really good weather today so it's not it's not 
too choppy at least where we've been so far  
but uh yeah this just adds a 
little bit of extra floatation
I just can't believe that we're the only 
ones here on this paradise and that's good  
because that means you know usually all 
the tourists kind of follow a similar  
thing so all the people that are beginning 
their tour at 9am will be all coming here  
and then they'll be going to the next 
place all kind of together so you get  
you know a head start and you're 
always an hour ahead of everybody so
it is good especially because we get to meet all 
the crowds that's right and we're not sharing it  
with like hundreds of people yeah because even 
if like five of those boats with 20 people come  
that's like 100 100 people here and they're 
still gonna charge you 1 600 yeah so you must  
play a double yeah and get the whole thing 
to yourself that's what I reckon so I'm not  
not double maybe like maybe triple to ten times 
was it 10 times well actually it was 12 12 500.  
10 times the amount no it's not about eight times eight eight more than double though yeah who cares  
um for me it's all about experience less 
about money yeah we go to the next place yeah  
how far away is the next place 
it's like about 25 minutes okay
oh Big Lagoon
how is this it's amazing it's good because we 
have it all to ourselves yes so like around 10  
a.m you said like how many people will be here 
actually it's starting now you see the boat that  
that boat that boat is coming here yeah does 
everybody go here first so we'll always be  
ahead of everybody that's good leaving it one hour early has so many benefits thank you very much sir
got our towels fresh pink 
matching the tour uniform
oh it smells really good it 
smells like fresh linen 
but I'm not going to use much 
of it just dry my hands and face  
because in about 20 minutes we'll 
be at the next spot let's go
so as you can see um that is right behind those 
hill to be able to go inside so we need to rent  
the kaya from here okay so the price we're at 
so the smaller one that is good for the person  
300 pesos 200 pesos 300 yes I got one for 150 
yesterday and that is our um so you don't get  
to be at the Big Lagoon oh yeah that's right 
I'm trying to like supply and demand I'm trying  
to negotiate have you seen The Bourne Legacy 
movie sir no the the movie are actually the  
actor is Jeremy Renner and then the last version 
of that movie was shooting here wow because 80 of  
me was filmed in the Philippines and the last 
part was here yeah okay The Bourne Legacy movie  
national team timing competition by Red Bull 2019 they came and shoot their show inside  
right so all these people we rent they're renting 
kayaks yes but these this is our guy or uh you get  
to choose are they all working for the same person or is it different it's a different company wow
all right so we made it to the Big Lagoon 
let's go the advantage of being early yeah  
yeah so many people usually there's lots of boats here yes if too much people here are actually me
enjoying the beauty yeah yeah there's too much 
people yeah for sure there's more yellow than blue
so um this is the Big Lagoon you can get 
small kayaks for 300 or big ones for 350.
this is a small one right yeah 
we have two two small yeah yeah  
not too small they're going to rent 
too small yeah we want separate yeah
have you done this before 
yeah yeah kayaking yes yes
all right so there's the Big Lagoon 
everybody all the boats they uh park out here  
because obviously it's really shallow so you 
only have to get the kayaks in and there's  
a few people there already but because we're 
early because we got out early in the morning  
this would usually be so full but luckily we get 
in there and we can explore all for ourselves  
this one's good to go yes sir yes sir all right 
let's hop in so this is the back part of the guy
facing this way
forward oh yeah all backwards yes ah yeah oh 
we even have like foot footholds very good
thank you let's get our life jacket 
done not for safety purposes so I can  
pop you guys down there and get 
a bit of POV all right I am off  
push off the boat all right off we 
go it's this way when do we come back
oh you're coming with kayak all right 
perfect so Ryan's coming with us  
but uh haven't been in a kayak for a while
just look how beautiful the scenery is
just limestone rocks everywhere
actually quite uncomfortable
so this kayak here they got a little 
drainage hole so it's literally just like  
flotation device it has self-draining holes 
so you're not going to fill up and don't  
go overboard or wow look how turquoise the 
water is you can just see straight through  
it that's how clear it is here guys it's 
got to be what a couple meters deep maybe  
but uh there's Dad coming out I just 
can't believe how few people there  
are like there's only a couple boats here so 
maybe there's a a couple people in there but
This is good
I actually apologize I did not 
obviously that was not intentional
rot in the kneecap
officially rammed me
with the puddle anyway all right  
a lot of I'm super Speedy quick 
super fast super fast gotta Escape
I just can't believe how clear the water 
is you can see the coral like at the bottom  
it's got to be like a couple meters deep but it 
doesn't look like that it looks super shallow  
that's just because the water's so clear and then 
we match that with the beautiful limestone rocks  
you got greenery growing out the side of it 
like look at all those trees just halfway up  
the cliff side it's uh look how beautiful that is 
not that I see there's a lot of coral though oh no
all right let's get some pace going catch up
to the crew
Ryan are there any dangerous animals or like 
snakes or fish when they show people they run  
away oh they're they're sea snakes wow this 
really oh so you might maybe they're sharks  
what what sharks like oh oeef yeah yeah
okay but they breed here until now it has 
shark here but only uh baby sharks hello
How are you?
all right it's getting a little bit shallow 
here it looks like we can possibly stand but  
this is just something out of a movie
cruising through the water
the mountains between us
it's absolutely gorgeous so 
this is the Big Lagoon now
why does it get the name
is bigger than smaller wood yeah so we're 
going to small Lagoon today no that's not  
part of our way so you should but this 
is the best this is the better one yeah  
smaller goon is one of the best ones big 
and smaller one is the most popular wow
wow this is just gorgeous
come on oh my God it's just so peaceful
oh my God
the water is just so turquoise I don't think it's  
coming up in the camera very well 
but it's just like emerald color
it's just gorgeous
Hello
in in here yeah wow it's very small
really all right I'm putting I'm putting my 
trust into you Ryan this is this is small  
what about my paddle oh my God all right I'm 
just committing to it you just got to go for it  
oh my God oh all right oh wow 
all right turn in we go oh
wow this is so cool
no it doesn't it doesn't echo 
the echo test has been failed wow
I feel like we're at a dead end
it looks like it looks like it's a dead end 
but there's a tiny gotta turn oh my God this  
is so cool yeah just you gotta really maneuver 
and time your paddles make sure you oh God see  
this is exactly what I mean now I'm gonna hit 
and there's really not much space to use you or  
in these tight crevices
there we go wow that was awesome
just look at these sharp limestone edges
if you would like hit that at speed with your head 
like that is that is cutting you up severely that  
is super sharp but the formations like just look 
how sharp they look they're like little daggers
oh we're allowed to swim here 
where should I put my car oh  
all right I'll let it float 
and you can yeah look after it
and take care of your kayak so I can jump off it
yeah
how did how deep is it I think it's like about
that's the interesting thing
yeah I can just float and hang is it sand at 
the bottom yes it looks like it all right let's  
go under you can't touch can you not now 
but we're gonna jump down and see foreign
yeah it's like eight eight feet like you said the 
water is like really warm in some parts but then  
like it's really cool on the surface usually 
it's cooler down the bottom but it's kind  
of like warm there's these warm patches and 
it's not me urinating that's just how it is
front flip
do you want to watch me fall 
when I get into this kayak
there's no way I'm getting into this first 
go we'll move everything we'll try our best
I saved the camera oh don't hit me I'm vulnerable
you're doing it all right
back in and ready to go do you 
want to have a race what a race
yeah I think you actually I think the odds are 
in your favor I think you're a better kayaking  
where will we go to it will line up I'll come 
over this side uh the corner of this in here  
like where that corner is near the corner yeah 
all right hang on one second all right everybody
so we're racing to that corner 
there right on the right side yeah  
yeah we gotta dodge the uh the obstacles um
you need to say ready set go for us
being able to being able to manage 
the GoPro is part of the challenge
ready I'm ready
oh no my GoPro is gonna go
oh this neck and neck his neck and neck come on
come on come on my gopro's going no no
I blame my GoPro falling
we only lost by a little bit like 
a meter or so oh a bit of cardio  
to start the day we're not really start 
the day we started the day a while ago
I'm I'm the loser I'm the loser sorry
oh my God she was wrong I feel like I've 
just let's go for the 50. I feel like I've  
disappointed everybody using 
muscles that I've never used in my life
yeah let's do that
we just had a quick 
little swim and we are going to go  
back to the boat and then go to the 
next spot which is snorkeling I think  
off a beautiful island I think it's off of Turtle 
Island you're not actually allowed to go on the  
island because it's prohibited because uh all the 
turtles lay their eggs there but there is a chance  
that there could be turtles swimming around the 
island so we're gonna get back to our boat quickly  
and try and beat this crowd because it is starting 
to get significantly more busier than what it was  
when we were first arriving so 
uh let's uh get on with it
anti-missile defense anti-missile defense
he was trying to ram me like I have the past three times but he didn't know we had an anti-missile  
defense boom take that hello I'm good how 
are you your day your day is good very good
I'm gonna missile defense system 
was shut down for a minute
we ran we ran out of firing 
power easier yeah I know
oh no oh
dude
all right brother it's okay all right 
thank you where are you going you're  
going into bigger inside do you 
have two uh like you have Serena
wow it's gotten so busy guys there's 
literally so many people going in  
and look at all the boats yeah yeah 
same pink pink shirts pink flamingo
it does handsome guy yeah they're not waterproof that's all yeah they're not laminated sorry enjoy
get the payments
oh so he was on the boat the whole time
amazing all right 
let's go to the next spot
to charge some batteries
oh how convenient we got solar panels on 
board even so we can charge some batteries  
while we go through a little bit of 
a swim we are at the next spot and  
look how beautiful it is out here so isolated we 
don't have anybody or any other boats actually  
there's one other boat over there but we've got 
all this area that's super beautiful coral down  
there so I'm excited to get everything on 
get the flippers on get the snorkel on and  
we'll be uh we'll diving in and apparently 
Ryan was saying Ryan so that's Turtle Island  
over there and that's where they lay all the 
eggs and stuff like that so sometimes they're  
swimming in this area so maybe we're lucky 
yes we'll see you can see some turtles what  
other wildlife is there there's maybe sharks 
uh sharks are very rare yeah but sometimes  
about a bunch of big fishes  even you 
know a small tuna a tuna yes wow might catch  
ourselves some dinner but we'll chuck our 
flippers on and we'll uh go for a dip too
are you meant to spit in 
in the I think I put water
no I think it stops them from uh
don't jump I'll do exactly that how 
do I get in then I'll go off the edge  
I can I can belly flop sure
three two one
I'm not sure if you can hear 
me but we're gonna go under
thank you all right here we are we're doing a 
little bit of a voice over here just because  
of the GoPro underneath the water you can't 
hear anything and it's kind of just bubbles  
and weird noises that you wouldn't usually 
hear but um going down first the first thing  
I saw was just all this Coral beautiful kind 
of different structures big boulders kind of  
flat pieces and even like spiky bits as well so 
it was really cool seeing all these formations  
and just swimming around there wasn't as much 
wildlife as I expected I did find this little  
anemone that was like bright blue there's a lot 
of bright blue things in this clip that you'll  
see over the next couple minutes blue seemed 
to be a very uh prominent color but just look  
at all the like Coral those massive boulders you 
got those spiky bits that would just be like so  
fun if you're a little fish just swimming around 
and then even those like really flat bits there  
just like so diverse and so unique seeing all 
the different bits of coral they weren't as  
colorful as I was expecting now kind of just 
like very bland colors but very beautiful  
just to like see the structures and stuff 
there's Dad with his GoPro vlogging the trip  
um there's a hill and here's another 
big blue starfish we saw plenty of these  
um just roaming around but they were very 
beautiful but it was really fun just like  
swimming around and going down to the bottom just going right near the coral and swing by it you see  
all the little fish just swimming around there's 
me with my flippers the flippers obviously make  
a massive difference you get around so fast and 
you can chase after the fish and here's a little  
similar to like a Dory fish in Nemo very beautiful 
blue uh color swimming around in the little things  
and then this big sea urchin thing I don't even 
I still don't even know what it is but it looks  
very vicious I'm not touching it it might even be 
Coral to be honest maybe like an early stage of  
its life but here I am just swimming around this 
is the first time I like equalized so I blow my  
nose out and just get my like ears so they don't 
have the pressure I've had issues with my ears  
and nose and throat like my whole life so I was 
a bit hesitant to equalize underwater but we got  
there so we could stay down the bottom um but yes honestly diving is just so much fun being able to  
see stuff that you just literally would never 
be able to see and I'm still yet to scuba dive  
um surprisingly even though I've been to so 
many countries where it's so popular I still  
haven't done it so definitely want to do it 
here is like this big trench so it's just  
like a massive drop-off that's like you just 
can't see anything and it's just super scary  
just floating over that but yeah these shots are 
really good I didn't do any color correction and  
I don't do it on any of my vlogs but this is just 
the raw footage like from my GoPro so these are  
just all the normal colors that you'd see so it's 
just super vibrant down there all those blue ones  
and then we've got the little angel fish I see 
these like in every country that I scoop uh sorry  
snorkel in there's uh like always these angelfish 
and they're so beautiful and so funny I just like  
chasing them and I started chasing this guy he 
was like a turquoise green he was super cool I  
kept chasing him around until eventually he got 
away from me but then I caught back up to him  
I think that's the same one maybe it's a different 
one I don't know here I am swimming under the boat  
it's pretty cool just being able to hold 
your breath and go under but yeah it's  
just really really fun like look how good 
these shots are it's just so cool being on  
at the bottom of the coral with the boat in the 
background just vibing out um but yeah I think  
that's gonna finish up so let's continue 
on with the with the Vlog everybody Tarana
I'm not sure if you can hear me because we just 
got out of the water and the audio might be uh  
depleted but we just met the crowd so we're there for like 30 minutes snorkeling but uh two big tour  
boats came in so uh we were literally there all by 
ourselves so it's remarkable how if you get out an  
hour early you can defeat everybody to each and 
every spot all right guys we're at the next stop  
um this is actually where we'll be having the 
the lunch so we have the option to have it on  
board or they can bring it over to us and we can 
have it on the beach we decided we're just gonna  
chill on the boat um so they're in the back 
here cooking up all of the uh the food all the  
all the uh the fish the chicken and all the 
goodies I'm going to jump across and check  
out this island the apparently there's a little 
store there that you can buy coconuts up so we'll  
buy a coconut to uh get over the heat here 
in El Nido so down we go all right
oh I have my wallet in my pocket so we got to be 
a little more cautious than what we are usually  
all right nothing in the pockets jump perfect how 
good all right what is the name of this one beach
Entalula Beach let's go check it out look 
how beautiful it is there are a fair few boats  
here though so this seems to be the place for 
all the other people having lunch and chilling  
out kind of the halfway point between the day 
tours so let's go see what they have
oh look fresh coconuts oh they're big ones as 
well how much are they hello brother how are  
you oh you have cocktails Jack Daniels gin how 
much are your coconuts 100 I'll have one please
so here they are there's plenty 
of drinks maybe after this coconut  
um we'll grab some some red horse to 
go with our drink or our lunch sorry
oh yeah
chop it open
we're gonna hold the red horse 
everyone's been having fun on this island
perfect thank you very much sir have a good day
all right I can bring back to you to open when 
I finish okay thank you all right fresh coconut  
does it get much better than this the sand is 
super fine here Brian was saying it's kind of  
similar to the sand on Boracay very like fine sand 
but it's super white beautiful landscape but uh  
they're heavy the ones in the Philippines 
when I had the one in Cebu it was super  
heavy as well we're getting a bit 
of an arm pump so let's try it out
oh coconut water
is absolutely incredible much 
needed to replenish the fluids
I think out of every single 
country that I've been to  
and the coconuts that I've had in those countries
this definitely tops it for the best view  
like I don't think you can get any better than 
this like these coconuts probably came from  
those trees so they literally just climb up chop 
them down and then go and sell them for 100 pesos
coconut juice so good
all right we're getting through this dad has 
joined the island it is uh I'm trying to get  
this down as fast as possible so we can go 
and enjoy a bit of red horse on this island
hmm tiny little bit left 
we'll go get it chopped open
you can chop in half for me please oh thank you so much literally got a bicep pump from holding her
I love they always fashion a spoon for 
you so you can scoop up all the meat  
look how perfect that is a little spoon
look how sharp that machete is 
slicing through that coconut  
let's see one one and done thank you sir thank you
a bit of coconut meat on the beach here in El Nido doesn't get much better than this we're back at  
the beach so we got our little spoon and you can 
see fresh coconut meat in uh this one's a little  
bit orangey that one's a little bit more white so 
we'll go for that one but let's just get big scoop  
oh look at that all coconut meat so fresh fresh 
as it gets it probably just came off of the tree
man look at that one big stripe 
straight down the middle that is so  
oh look there's an ant on me bye-bye boy 
it is so fresh just coming straight off
let's mix it all up get it all together
oh it's actually this one's really nice and 
there's a lot of meat in there as well so  
worth it what the two dollars you paid
do we just leave it on the beach or 
I don't know it's not natural right  
boss where should I I can where should I 
live here perfect thank you very much very  
delicious see you all day me and Dad tried 
Samwell for the first time and that was  
delicious but you can't go past a little bit of

Philippines most famous beer
excellent especially on a warm 
day and every day's warm here so  
um this is fantastic yeah and it's super 
cold it is cold yeah that's what I like  
about beer it's got to be cold really hard 
reminds me of Good Times everybody red horse
here in the Philippines and you 
know when I first tried it in Cebu  
it was good I had good company I met those 
friendly guys on the side of the street  
but this time Red Horse by the 
beach in El Nido like that literally  
there could not be a better spot to have a 
bit of red horse here in the Philippines El  
Nido it's just like look at the views that we got 
beautiful white sand and a beautiful bit of drink
that we can enjoy look at 
this guys look at this wasp  
what is that is it searching for like crabs 
or oh my God it just went into the hole  
definitely would pack a punch like you can just 
tell that that's a vicious wasp or beetle whatever  
it is oh he's out did he get something I know 
let's hope you got some food so I'm not up next  
he's going back in well maybe he's digging a hole
wow it looks vicious well while we've been 
messing around drinking red horse the crew  
has been cooking up an absolute feast I can see 
the tables out it looks like we got the food ready
so let's go and enjoy it a beautiful lunch  
on the water all right climb up the ladder 
with one hand or with zero hands one's  
holding the camera one's holding a beer 
the two most important things so oh wow
let's put the goods down this looks absolutely 
delicious and I think there might be a little  
bit more common but boy oh boy all right here's 
what we're looking at everybody we've got some  
fresh fruit we've got apples oranges pineapples 
bananas oh what is that eggplant eggplant and  
this is the sauce for the fish oh fish sauce 
very good we got grilled chicken we got fish  
we got pork we got some rice to serve it all up 
and a big bit of Pineapple so we can cut the fish  
but uh wow Let's uh I'll get a plate full and 
then we'll try it all out let's get some rice
over the place is very popular in the Philippines 
yeah they mix it with uh all the meats and stuff  
yes sir I'm doing a balancing act yeah um I 
hope you guys are hungry because you're going  
to help us eat this no sir we brought our world 
oh no we're not going to eat all this we don't  
like wasting food either all right let's get 
some oh fish freshly grilled barbecue chicken  
literally that was done just in the back here on 
the grills I'll show you quickly just over here  
all the oh french fries my favorite we 
got all the the place there is that banana  
no this is a boil ah the quiche very 
good it looks like a bananaq
like from Cebu yeah but that's where they 
cooked everything also we have here in the  
oh you have bananaq in El Nido you can go into market and things very good all right lots sounds  
and smells and looks and feels delicious 
let's go some pork fries make your favorite  
potatoes I've got my unusual plate 
the fish up super crispy Burger yeah
that means like eat well enjoy yeah
super crispy fresh off the grill.
wow
that is delicious the um the grilled 
pork have you got some yeah it's so nice  
oh and like later on it's so um so popular 
here in the Philippines but wow
oh that was delicious let's um mix it with some 
rice also I'm still in my mouth and get a big
spoonful of rice
um
most importantly
once you swallow your mouth full 
gotta wash it down with some red horse
hmm all right next up we got the chicken got 
the grilled charcoal layer on the edge there
mmm so crunchy
look at that
nice bit of chicken a bit hard in 
the middle but as you can expect  
when you're out this remote and 
you literally cook this on a boat  
you can't expect five star restaurant 
quality so this is pretty good
we've got some pineapple here it seems 
that this was the guy that got chopped up
um fresh pineapple here in the Philippines 
I think it's the best in the world honestly
I remember I had it in Manila on my first few 
days when I paid a thousand pesos for one piece  
I'm I was shocked at how sweet 
and juicy it was it is just
so good so sweet so fresh
that's good how are you enjoying the meal Dad good  
thanks for asking me when I got a mouth full 
of food I timed it perfectly for that I know  
you always do that the fish which um I'm 
not allowed with seafood but that fish  
it's delicious it's so soft I'm eating 
more fish than anything at the moment
um it's fantastic well they caught it 
they caught it when we were snorkeling  
yeah really yeah yeah right that was a bit too far
behind the people oh it's a shark
the food's really good I've 
got some fries here they  
look super crispy let's dip them in some ketchup
um well you've got to be honest with them haven't 
you they're a bit cold that's right but wherever  
you go french fries and they never disappoint 
especially when you can chuck on this much ketchup
all right we're gonna enjoy the food 
and then we'll get on to the next spot  
all right guys I was just snorkeling for 
like the past 10 minutes just enjoying it  
but I saw Nemo fish I saw like this big fish 
on the ground so just went back to the boat  
uh and we're gonna check it out I wanted to 
show you guys like I've never seen a Nemo fish  
a clownfish before so it's over that way there's a 
big drop off but you won't be able to hear me once  
we're under but I'll bring you to to go and find 
Nemo maybe we'll find Dory along the way.
here we are again with another voiceover uh in 
this one we're gonna go find Nemo so I saw this  
fish for like the past 10 minutes when I didn't 
have my camera and it was I thought it was dying  
and then as soon as I went like close with it to 
my camera cheeky guy just like came back to life  
grabbed a piece of coral and then just dipped 
but this is where I saw Nemo they were just  
fall looking around in the little uh I think it's 
called an enemy right like clownfish are the only  
ones that don't get stung by these guys I'm pretty sure and that's why uh they're able to like swim  
around in them but like other fish they get stung 
by them but just look how cute they are honestly  
like being able to see them for the very first 
time in real life is incredible but I ran out of  
breath there had to uh go for a quick little gasp 
of air but they are just like the most beautiful  
fish ever I'm not sure if it's biased just because 
of the Nemo movie but the colors just orange and  
white like it's absolutely gorgeous but there were 
three in there um so it's really cool being able  
to see them unfortunately Dory was not around 
then I I went down and did a shockers with my  
four-fingered hand didn't turn out as cool as I 
thought it would in the camera then I saw this  
little fish in Australia I think we have a similar 
fish here called uh lomtongs I think lomtoms or  
tomtoms but they're like these needlefish you can see how thin they are um they're just like like  
tiny little thin fish with like a really long nose 
so I followed him for a little bit at this spot  
there was a lot more fish but not as much kind of coral um then this was after our lunch so some of
the crew chucked a little bit of food over so 
the fish started to congregate here but that  
was super plastered but they're a lot bigger like 
there's a black fish there's striped fish there's  
really cool colors in there but it was good just 
being able to get really close to them and now  
we're nibbling away at the I think that's pork 
or rice or something um but then I found a spoon  
had started to go grab it get it out of the 
ocean and give it to the crew somebody must have  
left that behind on a previous trip or it went 
overboard maybe they were having a food food fight
but yeah just all the fish there just chilling 
by the boat knowing that they're about to get  
fed yeah there's some rice coming around but 
they're just so I tried to grab a bit of rice  
here and then feed it to the fish but while they 
come to my hand when they have all the little  
bits going around but it was cool getting these 
shots here just roaming around and just look at  
the visibility of the water like you can see so 
far as such despite having so many tourists there  
and so many boats coming in and out I'm amazed at how the visibility is and how clear the water  
remains so props to whoever's taking care of these islands and making sure that all the tours and  
stuff don't mess up all the natural stuff that we 
have at our doorstep and uh that's that
all right guys snorkeling was done I can't believe 
I saw Nemo like that is literally a bucket list  
item of mine tipped off the bucket list so we 
couldn't find Dory out there although we did  
find some blue fish that looks like Dory but it 
wasn't a real Dory it was the fake Dory but we're  
on to the final spot of the day the secret Lagoon 
apparently it's a secret let's hope there's not  
too many people there um but yeah we've had pretty good weather so far but we can see the clouds are  
starting to come on in and we got another oh that is so so ridiculously hot there we got another uh  
like a boat there with tons of people like 25 
to 30 people on it so you know it's just so  
good having your own space having the luxury to be able to walk up on the front of the boat if I want  
whatever I want I can climb whatever I want I can hang off whatever I want I definitely recommend  
the private tour it makes the experience so much 
better you can snorkel forever long you want you  
can just go at your own pace right but that's 
what you pay for the luxury and the freedom for  
so let's go to the final spot of 
the day I believe the secret Lagoon
all right guys we've made it to the secret Lagoon  
And actually surprisingly is very secret but it 
looks beautiful the rock formation here  
like nothing else and just look how blue the 
water is hundreds and hundreds of meters down
but there's only a couple other boats here 
so surprisingly it's like 2 p.m 2 30 p.m at  
the moment and there's actually not that many 
uh people here but just look at the scenery
breathtaking this massive mountains it's crazy
I don't know where we're pulling up
what we're doing we're getting 
awfully close to the rocks here  
they must be dropping the anchor 
maybe I'm not entirely sure
but maybe we'll have to swim in swimming 
to the secret beach at the secret Lagoon
Do we have to swim in Ryan?
you're jumping straight in 
there's a good snorkeling here oh
why do you have it ah
are the rocks are the rocks sharp all right
he's gonna do it
All right let's go let's go baby 
let's go so apparently it's really sharp
oh there's another boat I'll just hitch a 
ride with them all right we are swimming into  
secret Lagoon
they're from kicks sorry
oh get behind me why are you so close to me
all right oh it's fine so thankfully 
the rocks aren't too sharp so you  
don't actually need to wear shoes no but we were  
just swimming over them anyways oh my 
God what it really is a secret Lagoon
at the entrance yes just like about the seconds 
and then you like 10 10 meters oh a little yeah  
okay the seconds only then yeah yeah and 
when it's uh the tide is too high so the  
the entrance is totally covered by the water 
oh really so you can only go under really  
as long as you are a good swimmer so if some 
people do they get stuck here if they miss  
misjudge the tide yes like some tourist stuff 
on that side so high tide goes all the way up
yeah where it's dark yes wow and 
the most interesting uh part of  
this area is the you know as you can 
see yeah all the scenery information
so Ryan said that once again it's about 30 meters wide but it's like a secret Lagoon so during the  
high tide this gets fully covered and you actually 
have to swim under and through but I can see a  
glimpse of the water it is a slow line we just 
got beat by a big tour boat so they had like  
25 people coming in so I guess even if you're on a private tour you always end up getting caught with  
the crowd somehow all right we're going in let's 
see how it is it's just a short little entrance
so I guess during the high tide this all 
comes up and fills up this whole area
oh it's not very sacred there's lots of people
wow oh my God look at this look at all 
the formations it's like your own big  
swimming pool but you're sharing it 
with 100 people oh it's really cold
this is not it's super shallow it's only 
like a meter or so deep it's up to my waist  
level but it's so open it's just like a 
little swimming pool up here look at it
it's more fun in the 
Philippines everybody
man bloody crazy
oh my god oh oh oh
over thousands and thousands of years this 
uh sally type style ignite whichever one it  
is has been forming just a little drips you 
know it's all built little bits of minerals  
and salts and stuff and like over time you 
know maybe every year it grows a millimeter  
if you times that by thousands and thousands of 
years and you get something growing from the roof
you know what I just thought of how 
much urination it will be in this  
um I was not thinking about that
get flushed out hopefully better from from 
uh high tide to low tide at all but no one's  
going to urinate you here are they oh I 
definitely have to know I'm sure somebody  
else yeah somebody definitely has all right 
we're heading out believe it or not secret  
Lagoon is not so much of a secret anymore 
lots of people know about it maybe if you  
get here early in the morning like we did 
to the other places we'd be able to have  
this place all to ourselves there's so many 
people here but good to check it out still
all right well that is it I think we finished 
off at the secret Lagoon there wasn't so much  
a secret I'm sure there's been tons of people 
there beforehand but obviously it's just all  
the name right I there and realize that there's  tourists but nonetheless we got to experience  
this amazing geographical kind of formations here it's like uncomparable to anywhere else I've been  
see here in the Philippines it's just amazing they 
look like little antonyms big ant nests that are  
just been built on top of each other it's crazy 
that this is just like this is nature everybody  
and I must get props to the Filipino people and 
the people that are in charge of this area because  
unlike other tourist places that I've been around 
the world on these boat tours and stuff there is  
literally no rubbish whatsoever I've seen like 
the odds a piece of trash uh out here at our  
time today like it's remarkable how clean these 
waters are they're crystal clear they're turquoise  
they're blue they're beautiful so yeah props 
to everybody taking care of their litter and  
not taking it into the ocean and making sure it 
gets disposed of correctly but yeah we're going  
to make our way back two I believe El Nido Beach 
because the weather seems to be coming in look  
how great it is it wouldn't be a Filipino day 
without a little bit of rain at some point in  
the day so let's beat that back to the beach and 
hopefully we don't get too wet far enough
well remarkably we had really good weather 
basically 95 of the way it was only this  
trip home for the past 30 minutes that has been 
a little bit cloudy but it's not it's not too bad  
it's not torrential like we experienced yesterday 
uh it's just sprinkles a little bit of showers but  
yeah it's just so nice going back into El Nido 
Beach at the top of the uh the top of the boat  
I'm the captain now huzzah wow 
it's just absolutely gorgeous  
being at the top here there might be Coastal 
guards so we've got to be careful we should  
probably sit down but oh yeah we're gonna head 
to the beach and then uh we'll finish up
they get all the fruit yeah very good
they're kind of like poor children or 
me yeah carefully yeah it's all yours
we can jump off okay thank you very much 
no thank you Ryan thank you so much it's  
been amazing and thank you thank you for 
today thank you an excellent time we had 
an amazing time Ryanmate thank you so 
much buddy that was a wonderful tour
all right we're back on the beach back on El 
Nido Beach everybody say goodbye to Ryan and  
the crew and uh it's been a good day we turned it 
perfectly we came out when it was blue skies and  
we're coming back on its gray skies so amazing 
day exploring the islands of El Nido but uh yeah  
Thanks so much for watching!
As always chase your dreams!
don't forget don't forget don't forget don't forget to get my in the box no no we've 
already finished the video
