I guess one of my like first impressions of 
Manila is that it is super Americanized it  
seems like like it's an Asian city that has a 
lot of culture and you can tell that it does  
but it I've never seen more American stores in my 
life outside of the US it's crazy it actually is  
like really helpful like kind of feels like home 
and we're like so familiar with everything but  
vanilla it's a good City
welcome to the Philippines we just got 
here last night we had a 48 hour travel  
day to get here but we are finally in 
Manila we are a little bit jet lagged  
but there is no better way than to 
dive into some culture than trying  
their food so this morning we're gonna go 
get some true Filipino breakfast let's go
we are staying just outside of the 
popular area known as Makati to come  
to in Manila and we're walking around 
trying to find somewhere to eat it's a  
Sunday so it looks like a lot of things 
are closed but we did just stumble upon  
this little restaurant that looks very 
local so we're gonna see what they have
okay foreign
so we have gotten something called 
sealog and this is a traditional  
Filipino breakfast it just consists of rice 
and then you have some sort of meat and then  
a fried egg on top and it looks super 
simple but it looks super good so yeah
it's good look at what meat is sweeter 
than like what I thought it was going  
to be it's really good though I got 
the pork so it's gonna be interesting  
to try like the different flavors 
but for all and I like it it's fun
it is really good and like Manny said it's 
a little bit sweeter than you would expect  
but it tastes really good I guess when I 
ordered this which I asked what was beef  
and she said yes beef it's the top tapa so Topsy 
one she said and then there was also like pork  
couple other meat options that you can get over 
there but I'm not exactly sure what they were
for the both of our meals we paid 
220 pesos so that was super cheap  
but we're gonna head back to our room grab 
a couple things and then head into the city
we'll see you when we come back down  
all right so like an hour later we are 
on a random bus and we are headed to a  
model that isn't vanilla vanilla so a lot happened 
in the last hour we'll have to explain in a minute
man oh man all right so as we were 
walking here I went to fly the Drone  
just to get a nice view of the city 
and the Drone lost signal and it just  
took off on its own to return 
the home and it never came back
literally just flew away and it crashed 
somewhere it goes I think it crashed on  
a building that was right next to us yeah it's 
gone forever so I think we're gonna go and try  
to buy a new drone here luckily we are now at 
the largest mall in all of Asia so yeah we're  
at a big mall and there's an amusement park 
back here so I'm gonna try to forget about  
the crash drone it's always something yes 
so we're not gonna really show you inside  
the mall but we will show you the amusement 
park that is right next to it because that's  
really what we came here for before we lost 
the Drone yeah now we're here for a drone so
so we have made it out of the mall the mall 
is absolutely gigantic and it took us like  
45 minutes to find the DJI store but we 
finally got the new drone unfortunately  
I think this is the last drone that we're 
buying for a while even if we crash it  
this is it but we're outside at the 
amusement park now and it looks like  
almost everything is closed down we wanted 
to go on the ferris wheel it's not running  
right now but I think it opens up a little bit 
later at night either way though it's pretty  
pretty out here we're right on the water 
now we there's a ton of restaurants here  
there's a ton of Street vendors here yep 
so this is a great place to come later in  
the day we're gonna walk around and maybe eat 
some food here's the water behind me foreign
but I think maybe because it's Sunday they 
maybe had different hours we're not really  
sure so we're kind of just walking around I am so 
tired I have jet lag super bad I woke up at three  
in the morning this morning haven't been back 
to sleep so make super tired but we're gonna  
try to see if there's anything to do around here 
Maddie just got an iced coffee and I'm looking  
for something like a lemonade really thirsty 
and then we're gonna head to the amusement  
park and see if it's open yeah hopefully we heard 
it opens at two and it's like it's like one right  
now so yeah we're gonna find something to eat 
something to drink then head that way foreign
we have finished eating and we have now made it 
down to the carnival area and we have some good  
news it is in full force there are rides going 
the games are being played it's actually really  
busy down here it's super Lively there's a 
lot of people and so we're excited to ride  
some carnival rides it's going to be a nice 
change up for something that we would usually  
do in a big city so yeah before we fly to 
the islands we're gonna enjoy the carnival
so we've just been walking around this 
amusement park and it's actually pretty  
fun just watching kids go on the 
rides but I think we're gonna go  
get some tickets so we can go on the ferris 
wheel and maybe another ride so let's see
all right so we just got on a ferris wheel here 
at the beautiful Park I hope it's a good view  
it looks like it will be but we paid 200 
peso a person to come on this so not bad  
it'll be something fun in there
I can see my house from here
I'm not a big Heights person they're not 
my favorite and this is just like swaying
and there's actually quite a few mountains that 
are across this Bay so never knew that about Noah
this is just one of those moments where it's like 
the little simple things can be so much fun and  
really not had the best day today and just 
weirdly enough being in an a ferris wheel  
is exactly what we needed and I think that 
goes to show like traveling full time it's so  
hard sometimes and like every day isn't like this 
fun day where you like go out and do these amazing  
things and so like sometimes just doing the little 
simple things are a little bit sweet yeah this is  
kind of turning our day around weirdly enough yeah 
who knew an amusement park in the Philippines yeah
all done time to go on the next one
100 pesos to go on
I know that I said I'm not really a 
rides person but I think it's more of  
a not a carnival ride person I'll ride roller 
coasters all day long but it's just like the  
jankiness of carnival rides that I don't 
trust so giving Kyle props for this one
any last words
you get used to it after like first three drops 
but it was pretty fun I kind of wish it was taller  
but I was a little bit too big for the seat I 
could like barely fit it so definitely built  
for Filipinos not tall Americans like myself 
the sun is out and it is hot yep but I guess  
that was like a little dose of fun that we needed 
and it was a fun first full day in the Philippines  
so I think we're gonna cut it here and 
tomorrow we are going to be heading  
to a beautiful island so you can't 
wait to tell you yep see you later
