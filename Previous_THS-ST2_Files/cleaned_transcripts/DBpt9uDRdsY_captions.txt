good morning good afternoon wherever you are so 
we are here near divisoria which is what we're  
gonna do today we're going on a market hunt so 
you can see traffic here is absolutely insane but  
we actually just took the PNR which is I mean I 
think it's Philippine National Railway which it's  
um like a street Railway which is very interesting 
experience just said it was packed with people but  
yeah I saw on the train I looked at something 
it's with um Japanese words Japanese words I'm  
assuming it's a Japanese train um because I think 
some locals yesterday told me that Philippine was  
occupied by Japanese for a while so I think that's 
why there are Japanese trains or if you could just  
be import I don't know but uh anyway we're 
here on the streets and we're looking to go to  
the Divisoria which is a very famous market for 
locals as well as the Internationals so I'm very  
excited looking to maybe do some market hunt 
actually here in the Philippines currently the  
weather it's actually pretty okay if you're in 
the shade it's quite uh quite nice but if you're  
out in the shades at oh super hard super hot 
compared to Thailand I think Thailand is just  
usually it's super hot super sunny and uh not 
very humid but here I can feel a little bit  
humid humidity in here so alright where are 
we going where are we going I think we're in a  
local district local streets that's why we're 
a bit confused don't know where we're going  
where are we going oh no it's here where 
is it the Google map location it's not  
very accurate because when we put in divisoria it put us into 
this intersection here but it's actually right  
in front so just saying we asked some friendly 
locals and of course the direct us to the right  
direction so now we're heading over there just 
then I was gonna ask Kumusta Po Kayo just then I was gonna ask  
means like how are you to start a conversation 
and then say because yesterday the viewers told us  
"Kumusta po Kayo" how are you to uh respect elderlies and invest 
to a normal person then you say kumusta okay
anyway we're going to divisoria hopefully it is a 
big Market as I saw on the internet wow strong man  
strongman alright where are we going 
oh no why is the dog chained oh oh no
that's so sad anyway we are around 
here already you can see it's getting  
busy and busier we've got some fruit 
vendors here alright where is the start
I don't know why but it kind of reminds me 
of the hustling hustling hustling  
and bustling city of Bangkok Chinatown it 
feels like that a bit because you can see  
some Chinese words here as well wait maybe 
it's Japanese oh no it's Chinese alright
wait is this it I'm sure there is more to it I'm 
sure there's more I'm optimistic alright let's  
look around according to locals this whole area 
is divisoria so it's not just one dot that  
says divisoria it's the whole area so we're 
slowly walking around hopefully we can find a  
whole street you know different vendors that's 
the goal for us coming here to this area but you  
can see the architectures here are very different 
to the areas that we were in Makati I think there  
are many many Chinese infrastructures Chinese 
words here looks like a temple this one it is a temple  
so all right so now we managed to get into the 
shades because out there it was just too hot we  
can see there many many Chinese decorations 
look Chinese New Year alright let's see
 honestly guys I don't know what 
to expect because I didn't actually do any  
research but we're here and I guess we 
can film the raw authentic experience  
my reaction to this new area of divisoria so 
for now we're just crossing the road and we're  
gonna go to this shopping mall right here 
I don't know if this is part of divisoria  
crossing the road is never easy in Manila
okay luckily this truck driver let us go first okay
so chaotic here where is the divisoria alright 
anyway guys I'm hoping this is part of the visoria  
um I think this whole area is in divisoria so 
anyway we'll go into the mall and just maybe cool  
down a bit and see what's new inside all right 
guys so now we're inside here in the shopping mall  
and you can see there are many different vendors 
around as well so they're also selling at a good  
price they've got pants they've got basically 
all kinds of clothing and you've got kids stuff  
here as well I don't know what we're looking for 
today but I think we're just gonna have a long  
stroll along this shopping mall and just see if 
we can find anything special see if we can find  
anything else special so I think there are multi 
floors as well maybe we should go up let's go
and so nice being in here shopping mall because 
on a hot day like this you really need aircon so  
let's hope we can find something interesting 
around so you see you've got accessories what's  
on this side you've got some printing services 
and yeah just many different clothings many shoes  
as well and yeah overall it looks like a like a 
like an outlet kind of thing like a small outlet  
and you've got many many different vendors oh look 
at those you've got your Nikes Nikes you got your  
got some slippers there got some oh Christmas 
tree decorations kitchen Hardware so basically  
everything you need you can find here in this 
shopping mall you've got everything at a good  
price I think 150 2 for 250 so you've got some tanks 
here as well and yeah got a bit of everything  
see many many different vendors and alright guys 
so we came more and the shopping mall inside it's  
quite nice the aircon is very nice but can we buy 
like a ring light because we need it for our TikTok  
Tock so if you guys want to know how to talk about 
here's how Tick Tock but anyway we've got ring  
lights and Alina was looking at panties just then 
because everything in there is quite affordable
we need to  we need to be honest to 
our viewers you know and anyway we're heading  
to I don't know where we're going but we're just 
walking around this area because there's so much  
to see but just then in the shopping mall the 
reason why we stop recording is apparently there  
are signs that you cannot record so we stopped 
recording anyway we're out in the streets now  
so we are back to you guys so let's see what 
else we can find in here we've got bicycle  
accessories in this store many things to see 
around here different kinds of stuff they've  
got some bicycles for kids and you've got all 
kinds of different towels here many different  
types of towers and you've got what's this some 
rain jacket looking thing you can basically find  
all kinds of clothing for really affordable price 
oh this is the street I think turn left turn left  
I think this is the street I'm so sorry 
Alina you need to hold this for me sorry baby
here as you can see you've got a lot a lot 
of vendors and this is what I came for many  
different stores here you've got some slippers 
yeah I need slippers mine one mine broke in uh  
in Thailand is this good yeah oh it's it's really 
hard now is it good though yeah it looks nice yeah  
got many different kind of 
slippers this is good no  
there's no hard this is good yeah I 
think I need a pair of slippers too
yeah yeah it's good it's a good good hard 
enough I think better than my last one  
okay maybe we'll come back I think this is 
maybe we'll buy something yeah thank you  
and as you can see many other different 
vendors mini slippers I think today our  
goal is to look for something 
that's actually useful and not  
like souvenirs andwe're gonna 
find something like you know some drinks  
the guy was carrying some drinks I should have 
tried it just then but anyway if I see the next  
one I will try the drinks anyway we've got many 
different vendors uh the street so much you see
what else is here you've got some 
carpets more panites more dresses  
everything you think of you can see and of 
course there are some Christmas decorations  
here as well different Christmas 
trees remember the other day we  
saw Christmas trees in Ikea how much was it 
six thousand yeah hello hello how are you
see Filipinos they are so friendly 
everywhere they keep saying hello  
and what else is here more Christmas decorations  
but it's really hot in the streets of Philippines 
I guess surprisingly Thailand is actually cooler  
than here I think alright what else wow I 
love this store so nice so beautiful the lights  
see here in the Philippines in Christmas 
they actually celebrate really early so all  
my Filipino friends told me you actually start 
celebrating Christmas here around September all  
the way to December it's a very long time and 
what are you looking at, so comfy these pants
like you know pajamas oh I have pajamas now so don't need 
but you said you know here's the thing  
Alina keeps saying my jeans look so ugly I have 
many skinny it's not fashion anymore she said  
it's like a trend in 2019 or 2020. now Fashions 
big big big bulky pants yes big bulky fence  
ah I remember this we were here just now no 
wait wait wait wait don't cross them across  
hey baby where you going why are you Crossing
yeah we came from here just now I 
think this is the same shopping mall no  
yeah it is the same shopping mall so we're 
going we're not going back in but uh as you  
can see this is pretty much divisoria I'm not 
too sure if there are more to it but I'm just  
gonna keep walking hopefully I can show 
you guys more interesting content around
wow this actually lowkey reminds me of like the 
old parts of Hong Kong in Kowloon it looks  
something like this many different street 
vendors like Street Markets and you've got  
shopping malls that looks something like this as 
well and you've got buildings like obviously you  
know we're coming to the Philippines I didn't 
expect it to be a really high expectation but  
hey yo but but yeah the infrastructures here 
are relatively old like the ones in Hong Kong  
some areas so I guess this kind of reminds me 
of Home in a way kind of reminds me of home  
but uh yeah I always like exploring new 
areas especially in Asia even though you know  
I get to see different kinds of culture lots of 
different people see like for example these these  
things if I don't know and if you guys didn't 
tell me I wouldn't know it's called jeepney  
that's the thing about traveling I like seeing new 
things and learning about new knowledge different  
culture in the new country but now we're still 
walking on the streets and to be honest I expect  
I thought there would be a lot more Street Markets 
because I really want to go Street Market and see  
different things but so far we've only seen one 
stream I think we're missing something I think  
we're missing something at night here have
Tubana Night Market but open 6 PM so we arrive  
too early I think no it's it's too different 
this is day market and another night market with food
I think because we're leaving in two days guys so 
I don't think we can unfortunately go to Tubana
station wow I love this feeling the 
hustling and the bustling here in the  
city of Manila the divisoria this is one of 
the places I've been wanting to visit for  
a long time actually because I've seen 
many I guess YouTube people coming when  
they're coming in the Philippines 
they come to this area. chowking 
guys so now we're here on a bridge crossing 
over to the other street because you can see  
the traffic here can get pretty crazy and 
I don't know how people actually cross but I  
guess like growing up in Hong Kong this kind 
of traffic is very normal for me I was just  
like walk in the middle of the street you know put your 
hand out and then the cars will stop for you  
I think it's similar in the Philippines and 
right now we're going into a shopping mall  
called Dragon Age shopping center divisoria 
so I hope they let me film inside because I  
really want to show you what's like inside 
but there are security guard series I cannot
so you see that many beautiful wedding 
dress yeah so many beautiful places like  
handcrafted so nice wow amazing amazing amazing
Alina is dancing do you guys know 
that Tiktok trend just then
wait sing it do you do you want to marry 
me so this Dragon 8 Market actually it's  
a relatively small shopping center it kind of 
reminds me of the local small shopping malls in  
the streets of Thailand in an area called 
Ratchethewi that I went before when I first  
started my backpacking trip lots of like 
small small shopping malls with like small  
local stores they're very interesting very 
interesting yeah many tricycle bikes yeah
