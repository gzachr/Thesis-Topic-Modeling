yes what is the difference between mechado 
and caldereta i want to find out in this video  
i already have tomatoes bell pepper
it is a great weather for making this kind of 
filipino dishes look how cold it is it's ice
now to be more precise with the difference 
between mechado and kaldereta i want to know the  
difference between beef mechado and beef caldereta 
or could you also use any other meat for mechado  
or caldereta now i don't know if this is true but 
i thought that caldereta is often often used as  
kambing instead of baka today i'll be using baka 
last time when i made caldereta for my parents i  
also used baka i used two types of baka last time 
today i'm actually not trying to make caldereta  
but mechado while the beef is relaxing here i 
will quickly fry some potatoes these are tiny  
dutch potatoes called krieltjes so i'm gonna learn 
you a little bit of Dutch we call these krieltjes  
for now we have the patatas at baka before 
we continue i want to show you this beautiful  
painting that my dad made for us see this is a 
filipina cooking in the philippines and i guess  
she is cooking sinigang let me know in the 
comments what you think of the painting sige  
brown bawang, sibuyas at kamatis let's put two of 
those now i will also flavor it with tomato sauce
now in a minute i will put back the baka but the 
question remains what is exactly the difference  
between mechado and caldereta so the last time 
that i made caldereta for my parents i used  
like i said i used two kinds of beef but also i 
used ingredients such as liver spread it was a  
delicious meal and my parents really enjoyed it 
but to be honest i'm not really sure what is the  
exact difference so far because the kaldereta 
can be uh kambing but also beef diba? for now  
i turn the heat lower and then cover it you know 
when i just checked when i checked on the internet  
just now i found out that these bell peppers 
might not be needed after all or mechado so  
uh instead it's gonna be potatoes at carrots and 
i read that i can flavor this with some soy sauce  
pogi what is yung difference between 
mechado and caldereta? of course the  
most important is that the food is delicious 
and to be honest all of them are delicious  
and give me good memories of the philippines we'll 
flavor the dish with a little bit of black pepper  
so the difference that i found between caldereta 
and mechado is that mechado doesn't have any bell  
peppers and also no liver spread but if you know 
any other differences between the two please let  
me know in the comment section i hope you enjoyed 
the video if you want to see the caldereta video  
that i made it's here taste is really good 
what a wonderful dish from the philippines  
and i'll see you next time with more filipino food
