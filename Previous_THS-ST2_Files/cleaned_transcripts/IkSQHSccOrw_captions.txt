Ever wonder about those beautiful young 
Filipinas you see hand in hand with older Western men?
What's really going on there? Is it love? Acceptance? Money?
or maybe a midlife crisis at its finest?
I've got some first-hand experience dating in the East
and I'm here to peel back the layers  
of this fascinating cultural puzzle.
So, come along as we dig into the reality of these relationships.
Talking openly about age gaps, how society sees things
and some truths about dating that usually go unsaid.
In this video, we're going to explore why so many stunning
Filipinas decide to date and marry older Western men.
Like any cross-cultural relationship,
these relationships have their pros and cons.
But with understanding and some work. 
You might find the pros outweigh the challenges.

Now I've picked up on this trend
of Filipinas tying the knot
with older men, especially Western men.
I've had some personal experiences here
and chatted with friends
who are married to Filipinas. So, I think 
I can offer some insights that could be useful  
if you're thinking about getting
involved with a younger Filipina.
It's worth noting that it's pretty standard
for Filipinos to marry someone 
their own age, just like in the U.S or Canada.
But what I found pretty unique is how
open Filipinas are to dating older guys.
Take me for example.
When I was 34, I dated a Filipina who was just 20
and our age difference was never a problem.
Thinking back, I'm pretty sure if I was still living in 
the U.S or Canada, I wouldn't have caught the eye  
of many women in their mid-20s.
Do you feel the same? If so, give this video a thumbs up
and tell us your story in the comments.
After sharing about my relationship
with a younger Filipina and being  
a Thai National who dated Thai women while also 
spending years growing up in North America.
I bet you're curious. Take a look at this photo.
That's me and next to me is an ex-girlfriend of mine.
Which nationality do you think I'd recommend 
most to English-speaking westerners looking  
for a partner in Southeast Asia?
Thai?
Filipino?
or perhaps something else?
Keep watching until the end to uncover my recommendation.
Trust me the answer might just surprise you.
Interestingly, Filipina's openness to dating older men
isn't limited to westerners.
From what I've seen, they're pretty
open to dating older men from
different places, not just the West.
Imagine a guy who's recently lost his
wife and is ready to find someone new.
Younger Filipinas might be open to dating him as long as  
he's decent looking, smart, and fun to be around.
One thing that really stands out to me about Filipinas.
Especially the younger ones,
is just how mature they can be.
Like, I have this American expat buddy  
who married a Filipina, that finished college at 
19 and was already working as an office assistant  
sending money back to her siblings.
I kind of feel like this level of responsibility and maturity  
often starting from a young age.
Really sets a lot of Filipinos apart,
they might be young but they've  
often got life experiences and responsibilities 
that make them seem older.
Which might explain why they're open to
relationships with older men.
Remember not every Filipina is
looking to date to date older men.
There are plenty who prefer men
their own age or even younger.
Some Filipinas also prefer Filipino men
or have no specific preference for Western men.
So, while we're focusing on the trend  
of Filipinas dating older Western men, keep in 
mind that views differ greatly among Filipinas.
Alright, so we've talked a bit about the age gap and
why it seems to be more accepted among Filipinas.
Now let's talk about how society sees 
this especially in the Philippines.
Is dating an older man seen as a good thing?
A bad thing, or something in between?
Stick around, we're about to get into that in the next chapter.
Is it acceptable? Let's keep peeling back these layers.
Another thing that I've noticed is that many 
Filipinos perceive older men as more responsible  
mature and kind.
When I asked my Filipina girlfriend
at the time about the perception  
of older men as more responsible and mature.
She agreed.
Now you might wonder why these matters to Filipinas?
Well, it's because they take marriage 
very seriously partly due to the fact that divorce  
is not legal in their country.
The Philippines is the only country
in the world besides Vatican City  
where divorce is illegal. Now its
lawmakers are working to change that.
The Philippine Senate is 
back in session this week
and it's considering a bill that for the
first time would allow people to divorce.
Because of this they're often on the 
lookout for a life partner who they believe can  
provide a stable loving home.
That's why they might lean towards an older man.
They think he might be more experienced and
ready to settle down.
Of course they're aware that women can  
only have kids until a certain age.
While men can become fathers
pretty much anytime.
This is just one of the many
considerations that come into play.
If you're thinking about dating
someone much younger.
Remember that the larger the age gap,
the more challenges you might face.
Here's the key thing to remember, if you're considering
dating or marrying someone 30 or 40 years younger.
You need to seriously think it through,
not just for you, but for her too.
Ask yourself: "Can we truly connect on a personal level?"
"What will happen to her if I'm not around anymore?"
In the Philippines, it's generally accepted
for a younger woman to date an older man.
But let's be real here.
Your looks and overall health do matter.
However, there are also many Filipinas
who are independent and prioritize  
shared interests over age and nationality.
These women might be more interested in dating a man  
who shares their love for hiking, music, art, or food.
Rather than simply his age or origin.
So, if you're 70, bald, and a bit overweight.
Don't expect a line of young attractive Filipinas
to be fighting for your attention.
In other words, don't expect to be treated
like Brad Pitt on his best day.
But if you're in your 30s, 40s, or even 50s, and you 
take good care of yourself and keep fit.
You'll find that many younger Filipinas are
more than willing to get to know you.
So, we've talked about the age gap
and whether or not it's acceptable.
But there's another piece of the puzzle we can't ignore.
Family pressure and responsibilities.
How do these influence Filipinas
when choosing a life partner?
Let's talk about that in our next chapter.
Although family pressure can play a significant 
role in many Filipina's choice of partners.
It's important to remember that many Filipinas make 
independent choices about their relationships.
Free of external influence.
With that said, it is common
in the Philippines for the parents to  
encourage their eldest child
to finish their education first.
Once that oldest kid starts working,
they're now in charge of helping their 
younger siblings get through school.
You know, an average worker in Manila working 10 hours 
earns around $35 a day, that's 35 bucks!
and those living in the provinces earn even less.
With wages like these it's no wonder  
many Filipinos who find it tough to get by 
and dream about working overseas.
Even with some negative stereotypes floating
around about Filipino women, remember?
The wedding bells won't ring without
the foreign guy saying, "yes".
A lot of Western men looking for a
Filipina bride are in their 40s or older.
Some are even divorcee's, having
gone through tough and bitter marriages.
This is partly why many think that Filipino
women marry foreign men for their money.
I mean, if it's not for physical attraction,
what else could it be?
It's true that many Filipino women tie
the knot for financial security.
They do it though with the hope that they'll
genuinely fall in love with the man someday.
No matter how old their husband
is or what others think.
Many Filipino women believe that they
will come to truly love him in the end.
Some might say that marriage for these women is
just a business transaction and only focus
on the material benefits.
Sure, in some cases that could be true.
Remember that there are numerous 
of genuine love stories out there.
Sometimes it's easy to judge these relationships.
Especially when we see some Filipino
women marrying for money.
But let's remember that everyone
has different life goals and priorities.
As long as the relationship is consensual.
We should respect their choice.
Now that we've talked about family pressures and responsibilities.
Let's move on to another critical aspect
of these cross-cultural relationships.
How can they be seen as a way out of poverty.
But is it that simple?
Let's find out.
You know, marrying for money is not uncommon 
in many Asian countries, especially places  
like the Philippines and Thailand.
But let's be real here, not all are looking for cash,
but yes, a fair number are.
and seriously who wants to marry a deadbeat?
I'm guessing none of us?
The Philippines once considered a third-world 
country is now labeled by the World Bank as a  
developing country.
But the truth is, for a lot of folks there,
opportunities to upgrade their lives are still limited.
When you're living in a place where
health care and education are hard to come by.
The desire to escape poverty becomes a big deal.
Plus, let's not forget that Filipino women
are super tight with their families.
For some, marriage to a foreigner
may open up opportunities  
to provide better support for
their families back home.
It's not just about financial stability but  
also the hope of building a loving partnership,
that can enhance their lives in multiple ways.
But watch out if you find one and
they act like they've won the lottery.
There's also this common belief in the Philippines
that anyone earning dollars must be rolling in money.
That's one of the reasons why so many
Filipinos are keen to work overseas.
For Filipinas who haven't had
much in the way of education.
Seeing foreigners as a ticket out of poverty is common.
Some might frown upon this, but can you 
really blame them for wanting a better life?
It's not all one-sided though,
While the Filipino woman may gain
a more financially secure life.
The foreign man often finds
companionship and love in return.
It's not a one-sided affair but a relationship
where both partners stand to gain in their own ways.
It's true that some Filipinas view marriage
as a potential ticket out of poverty.
Many others marry for love,
companionship, or shared life goals.
Regardless of their partner's financial status.
As mentioned before, the Philippines is 
still a developing country and it can't provide  
the same benefits for its citizens as countries 
like the U.S, Canada, or Australia can.
Being able to study, or work overseas is a big deal for Filipinos.
Even though everyone has the right to a quality education.
It's not a given for all Filipinos.
Most public schools funded by the government are packed  
to the roofs and lack the right resources.
On the other hand, private schools with
better facilities and teaching are pricey.
We've talked about the potential of marrying a foreigner
as a way to seek better opportunities.
But what is life really like after marrying a foreigner?
In the next section, we're going to dive into the realities 
faced by many Filipinas who have made this choice.
This chapter might be the most crucial, if you're 
seriously considering tying the knot with a Filipina.
What does life look like after marrying a Filipina?
Do all the Fairy Tales come true 
or are there more realities to confront?
First things first, marrying a Filipina,
particularly if you are a western man.
Often comes with certain life changes for her.
The most obvious is relocation.
Moving to a new country is no small deal.
It's a cultural shift, a different way of life, and in  
some cases a stark contrast
to the life she had back home.
Adapting to a new country can be
both exciting and challenging.  
New experiences, different traditions, language barriers.
All these can be initially overwhelming.
However Filipinas are known 
for their resilience and adaptability.
Which often help them settle in and
become a part of their new communities.
Yet, it's also essential to remember that relocating
doesn't just mean changing physical locations.
It's about leaving behind family, friends, and a part of herself.
That's deeply rooted in the Philippines.
The longing for home or homesickness
can sometimes be quite powerful
and it's important that her partner
is supportive during these times.
Another aspect to consider is the way
society might view your relationship.
Stereotypes often follow cross-cultural marriages
but it's vital to not let this affect your relationship.
Respect communication and understanding
are key in navigating these situations together.
Now let's address the elephant in the room.
Let's talk about a common stereotype about these relationships.
It would be unfair to say that all Filipinas are
purely seeking love in these relationships.
Like in any other people there may be
individuals with hidden motives.
There have been cases where some Filipinas
have taken advantage of older Western men
for their financial security.
A relationship that starts with such
intentions can lead to disappointment  
or even heartbreak.
Therefore, it's important to establish
a foundation of trust, communication,  
and mutual respect.
Before making a lifelong commitment.
Also, be aware of red flags such as
an excessive focus on financial matters
or a lack of interest in your personal life.
On a brighter note, remember that most Filipinas 
deeply value their relationships and family.
They could be living on Mars and they'd still find
a way to send a ‘how are you text’ to their mother.
Sending payments back home, staying in touch 
through calls, and social media and making regular  
visits back to the Philippines is a
part of life after marrying a foreigner.
The success of any marriage, cross-cultural, or not.
Largely depends on the couple themselves.
The foundation of your relationship, love,
trust, mutual respect, and shared goals.
Will determine how you navigate life's ups and downs.
Every Filipinas experience after
marrying a foreigner is unique.
Some may face the challenges we've mentioned. While others 
may have a completely different set of experiences  
based on their personal situations.
Their partners support and
their own ability to adapt and grow.
Overall, however, many Filipinas find a deep 
sense of satisfaction and happiness in these  
cross-cultural relationships.
There's something beautiful about blending cultures.
Learning from each other and building a unique life together .
It may not always be easy
but patience and a fulfilling life after
marrying a foreigner is more than possible.
So, are you ready to start on this journey?
To experience a unique blend of cultures,
values, and traditions.
Remember, it's a journey that requires
patience and lots of understanding.
But in the end, it could be one of the
most rewarding experiences of your life.

nationality I'd recommend to English speaking folks

I'd pick.....
Filipino women.
Yep, you heard right.
They have this amazing combination  
of friendliness, family values, and being able to 
connect with Western culture.
But you might wonder why?
Why Filipino women and not Thai or someone else?
Well, I talk all about it in my next video titled
"Is retiring in Thailand better than the Philippines?"
and don't let the title fool you.
It's not just about retiring.

might be better than dating Thai women.
