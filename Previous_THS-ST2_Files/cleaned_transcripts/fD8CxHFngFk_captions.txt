what's up guys welcome back today's
question comes from alexandra j
who asks i've always wondered how you
guys communicate on club teams with
players from different countries
is there a translator or what great
question alexandra normally you're not
going to have a translator when you go
overseas
so it's really up to you and your team
to work
out the communication i know here in
russia it can be pretty tough there's a
pretty big language barrier but
i've tried to learn a couple of russian
words for volleyball and i'm lucky to
have some teammates that speak english
so
adding that up we just work it out on
the court and because this is my third
year on the team
it has become a lot better it can still
be a challenge
but if i really really need to
understand something i know my setter
sima feijokowski
speaks perfect russian and he speaks
perfect english so he translates to me
in the end so he's kind of like
my personal translator
all right guys today we are going to be
watching philippines first indonesia
men's volleyball from the 2019
southeast asian games i watched the
semi-final between the philippines and
thailand so
i felt like i should watch the finals
between the philippines and
indonesia i do know the result of this
match so i decided to watch the second
set
starting from 10 10 because this was
definitely the most exciting and
entertaining set
let's do it all right philippines
serving 10 10.
great job sir over put it away nice got
up put that ball down
sometimes when the ball gets super close
like that to the net if it's not too far
over the net you're gonna have to just
put it down like that you can't really
take a swing at it so he definitely made
a smart play there
nice okay that's espejo that's the star
player right
oh oh interference i don't even know how
you call interference from the ref but
because that setter went onto the
philippine side of the court trying to
pursue the ball but he stepped into the
court
definitely an interference
good fight off monster block
indonesia this is the finals you better
go for that ball
oh i love the fans let's see here got
over that net a little bit late but at
least he got his hands over great
block oh this server is putting some
pressure on
okay swing down the line
i can't tell where the ball is going
from this angle oh here i can
ah didn't quite take enough line but
that could be in the scouting report who
knows
jump serve a little tight
setters always win joust why
great dig nice set
little chaos little chaos
and the block out indonesia is running a
pretty quick attack
and the philippines had some chances
there but they didn't quite take
advantage of those touches
didn't quite get maybe high enough in
system enough
and indonesia took advantage 12 serving
13.
[Music]
great pass nice set
how do people do kick saves like it's
normal
oh look at that crowd okay first the
kick save and then the block
are you kidding
let's watch this gets blocked
i don't understand how you do that and
then the strong right hand see they took
angle on that ball in that same hitter
was that the same hitter
and got the block
okay he's just coming right back and
crushing the ball
the surface here
great pass great technique
these players are just flying through
the air and killing the ball i want to
watch that pass again
so steady kept his shoulders forward
dropped his right shoulder
picture perfect technique
i wish i knew more about the philippines
team and the indonesian team i just
don't know much about them but i'm so
impressed
by their technique and how they're just
swinging away and crushing the ball
float serve
a little bit off
[Music]
oh number one that's the star right he
recognized that
that set was a little bit off couldn't
take the best swing at it so he decided
to roll shot i think if you're indonesia
you want to recognize that the ball is
off it was a little bit behind him and
that's usually a cue and a sign that
a player might roll shot the ball
serving
out of the technical timeout 1614
out of system free ball
oh center don't take that
nice touch indonesia
nice plate i got to watch that one again
i think it's a little bit frustrating
that the philippine setter took this
somebody
else got to take this ball so they can
stay in system
and then indonesia gets this great touch
great control to the net
in system puts the ball away
great strong hands
these bars are fearless i love to watch
how they're just crushing the ball
17 15. nice liberal way to get under
that short serve
gosh the crowd is loud oh
wait they don't know what to call oh a
net violation can we just watch that hit
again
this guy a little bit tight oh that was
out
but the philippines net now
number three here wow
toss okay great technique
shoulders forward solid platform oh
there's some
trash i gotta watch that play again
watch this pass he stays so solid
through his platform nice
watch his stare down oh
you guys is there any bad blood between
these teams
or what please let me know because this
is getting heated
deep float a little bit to position two
but not a bad pass okay
crushing it through the seam one thing
is clear if you're gonna leave a seam on
these teams they're gonna hit it
long distance yup making number six work
right in the seam
that defender was in a great spot but
too much heat to handle
nice that is a heart not oh
uh oh all right it's okay it's okay it
happens
it happens that was a nice pass i don't
know how he bend his knees like that
oh yes keep your chin up after a mistake
nice
great pass again no
oh he had he just tried to go a little
bit too sharp there another nice
pass indonesia up by one they're just
making less mistakes
okay middles playing defense oh
almost with the sick run down but you
love to see those middles going after it
getting the ball up or running it down
let's see here
go number three oh he had he could have
maybe done two hands
19 all
captain and play nice set
what that deserves a pen throw but i'm
not
look at this set 40 feet 30 meters
no i don't know how far that is dang
what a play corner to corner
great pass the slide holy shisa
all right i got to watch that pass again
this libero made it look easy just
and then the pipe oh
that was gnarly bagoonas
2020 no
kept it in play nice pass
a little tight oh he tried to
tool please show a replay i feel like he
could have pushed it to the middle maybe
are they gonna show you
oh he's high oh it was really that's a
tough play
he tried to wipe it
ah i got another unforced error
indonesia they're just putting the ball
in to try and make philippines work
hope
that was straight over the block
gets up great spot by the indonesian
defender just a lot
of pace coming in his direction 21-22
nice this setter is doing a really
really good job
of keeping the tempo even if the ball is
off the net and then the hitters
are just using this block
taking advantage of these seams 23-21
they're going to bagunas every time and
indonesia knows it
go nice come on
what happened they're asking for a
challenge the ball is definitely out but
they're challenging the call
here's a challenge got the touch
barely off the fingertips volleyball is
a game of
millimeters oh my hands are sweating
22-23
shoulders forward technique hope
bye bye indonesia these outsides are
killing it
i'm so impressed that was just
a great side out i mean that was picture
perfect reception
set her doing his job and the hitter
putting it away
what else could you ask for set
point to go up 2-0 in the match
they're definitely working on number one
holy moly
again flying through the air pipe what a
play
23-24 bagoonas keeping it in play
nice up go what happened philippines is
cheering
i i i what what what what's going on
i don't know the call said his fault
philippines fans are cheering
oh he met he couldn't control how much
he was flying
philippines takes advantage 24 all
another seam hit they got to close that
seam indonesian hitters are
too good in this match right now
set point 25 24 again with this toss
keep it in play filipino libero nailing
it like usual
this crowd is gnarly i wouldn't do
anything to be there or play in front of
this crowd
25 all deep float
again with the scene like they gotta
change something bring that outside
blocker in or something it's
passing that left hand almost every
single time
let's see here yeah you can see it's
just
right in that scene maybe number 11
could take a step to the left
i don't know i don't know these players
set point again deep float
with the sick block to end it the past
came a little bit off the net maybe he
could have had stronger hands i don't
know you can't really tell kind of a
high ball
indonesian blockers get there
and get the monster sick block to end
set to
27 25.
all right guys definitely an
entertaining entertaining match i have
never watched
indonesia volleyball before but i am so
impressed their passing was on
that setter was delivering the ball from
10 feet off the net
and those outsides were killing every
single ball but i'm gonna be honest i
was kind of rooting
for the philippines especially after
that epic epic win they had
over thailand but i just think in this
match they didn't quite have the energy
or the emotions to take over indonesia
who was playing
so so well so congratulations to
indonesia they ended up winning the
match 3-0 over the philippines
to win the 2019 southeast asian games
anyway guys i hope you have the best
best weekend
i have a match on sunday hopefully we
win and advance to the final six
but get out play some volleyball if you
can
have fun and i'll see you all soon peace
you
