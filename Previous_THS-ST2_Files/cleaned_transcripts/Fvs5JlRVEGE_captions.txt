Good morning from Cebu.
Hello, from the Philippines.
I'm here in the Philippines, everybody.
And, uh, yesterday when I was out
exploring all in the hot sun in the
singlet, I got a massive tan line.
So that's why we got the, uh, the long Jersey.
The Sri Lankan cricket Jersey.
We still got that with us.
Uh, but I'm in desperate need of a haircut.
Look at this.
It is an absolute mess.
I'm looking like a proper.
Australian surfer boys.
So we need to fix that up.
So I was looking on Google
maps, uh, early this morning.
And, uh, I walked about 10 minutes from
my hotel down all these streets here.
And apparently there's like a small barber
shop, um, that we can get a trimmer.
I think it's a super local place.
We obviously got the shave done,
uh, in Manila at like a really.
Um, like fancy place, but you'll
know how much you love the local
local shops, the local street shaves.
It's not a street shave, but I think it is like
a really small shop that we can get a haircut.
Oh, look, they're playing basketball over here.
Maybe, maybe after our haircut, we can
come back and play some basketball.
Hey,  all right.
There's so, man, there's so much more
fun in the Philippines, everybody.
That's their slogan.
Uh, to get the tourists in and
it's a hundred percent, right.
So I think, oh, literally
right there, tar barbershop.
That's the one.
So hopefully they have some spots available
and we can get this, uh, mop turned into
a reasonably decent, uh, haircut tara na.
Or I guess I can say, because I'm wearing the
Sri Lanka shirt, but we're here in the Philippines.
So Tara na, hey brother.
Everyone's so friendly.
Let's go inside and get a haircut.
Hello.
Hello what's up.
How are you?
Kamusta ka?
Okay lang.
Good?
I can get haircut?
Yeah.
What is your name?
Um, my name's Marky.
Ah, you know, your name is Michael Jordan.
I sit here?
Yeah.
How much does a haircut cost in Philippines?
100.
Sorry?
How much?
100.
That's a good price.
It's very, very dirty or not dirty.
Messy.
All right.
What haircut do you want?
I just want like, uh, maybe
like this much one here.
Oh, let's go for this one.
No, no, no, no, no.
Um, they're all, they're all short ones.
Maybe just like, like that much
off, just like clean, clean up.
This is the thing.
I, I never take any care in my hair.
I don't really like care
Oh, you have good haircut, but it is too
short for me.
I need to keep long hair.
Yeah yeah.
But not, uh, not shaved.
Hey, let me, I'll show you a photo.
You have a picture?
Yeah, here, like, like short,
like just little short.
Yeah, little like maybe that much.
Okay.
Okay.
I have, what is your name?
Uh, Julius.
Julius.
I have faith in you, Julius.
You make me look beautiful.
Okay.
Mm-hmm  all right.
So we have.
Some foot stomps here might put the hat there
and we'll put the phone up there as well.
Hello.
You're here for a haircut?
You're here for a haircut?
No.
You're working here?
How old are you?
I'm 12.
13?
You don't have school today?
No?
Okay.
All right.
I literally not
had a haircut for so long.
Yeah trim, trim.
Wow.
This is the first time my hair has been
brushed in like a year.
Yea I make uh, YouTube vlogs.
Do you have your phone?
I will.
Oh, I'll put it in my, this is
the photo that I gave everybody.
Just for reference.
I been wearing a hat for so long
just because my hair is not clean.
That's why I've been wearing a hat  but
especially at the back, the back of it is so.
Very good.
All right.
The haircut is underway.
It's always fun.
Oh, look haircut.
A hundred.
Shave 40.
Yeah.
I'll type Luke Damant.
That's it?
Yeah.
It's always fun.
Coming to different barber shops, seeing
all the different photos that they have.
Look at that one, the doggie getting a, a haircut.
Do you do dog
cutting as well? Like dog, dog, uh, dog grooming?
Yes.
Yeah.
Where did the dog sit?
You can see how my forehead I'm sweating so much.
It's so hot here in the Philippines.
That's why I got so burnt yesterday.
When I was out in the downtown area.
How long have you been here for haircut?
Like barber, how long?
Uh, almost.
10 years.
10 years.
Yes.
So you are the owner of the shop?
Yes.
And you've been here for 10 years?
Uh, no, uh, almost five years.
Five years.
But you have 10 years experience?
Yes.
Very good.
Oh yeah.
Starting to look cleaner already, everybody.
How good.
Big bit coming off.
That's what we like to see time to go short
back sides, basically for all of my life.
I've had long hair, except for one time.
Uh, right when the pandemic happened,
I decided to go super short.
I'll chuck a photo up now.
So, but since then I haven't had
like a real haircut, I like it long.
It's part of my personality.
Another part of my personality.
Sweating like crazy.
Look at that.
It doesn't even feel that hot though.
We have AC up there and it's actually quite cool.
You are becoming barber as well?
What do you want to become
when you grow up?
- Basketball?
Oh you, yeah.
So Michael Jordan.
Who is, who is your favorite NBA player?
Where do you play
Basketball?
Where do you play?
Yeah.
Uh, at the gym.
Yeah I saw when I was walking
here, I saw people playing.
Look at this
everybody you can see, as I was saying,
look how long it is at the back.
It's like, I have a mullet, which is actually
a pretty popular haircut in Australia, but.
Don't spend too much time in Australia nowadays.
So it'd be rude for me to have a mullet.
If anyone is from Australia,
you'd understand the, uh, the stereotype
of a mullet and what it means.
Anyways, start to come off.
I think he's, he's starting with the front
part, getting all those, getting all the
shape done and then he'll attack the back,
because yeah, you can see that's actually good.
I honestly think the last time that
I purposefully went to a barber shop
to get a haircut was in Kurdistan. 
That was a long time ago, over a
year ago, maybe a year and a half.
And we had Elle I think.
Do my hair, everyone was saying that
she's the prettiest woman that they've
ever seen  which she was very attractive.
How many customers do you have per day?
- Six.
They come for a haircut or they come for shave
or you do hair color different?
- No color.
Uh, only cutting.
Yeah.
Which haircut do Filipino
people like?
- This.
Yeah, the short one.
Yeah I notice a lot of them have like the
short haircut kind of like a fade.
So this tool that he's using now is
just to thin out the hair just to
make sure it doesn't look all poppies.
Get it leveled out on each side.
It's actually turning out,
good.
We'll see at the end, I'm liking it.
It's good.
You know, the good thing is with
hair is that it always grows back.
So even if you have a bad haircut, couple
months, time, it's back to where it was before,
unless you go from super long hair to shaved.
But at the end of the day,
it's always gonna grow back until
you reach 35 and you go bald.
A lot of people have been saying,
because I wear a hats often that
it's gonna cause my hair to recede.
I'm only 22.
So let's hope I don't have a
receding hairline anytime soon.
No, that is me.
Oh.
And also Facebook TikTok, everything we're
on all platforms, everybody in the description,
you can see my channels, my shorts channels,
my clips channel, the TikTok, the Facebook.
So it's not just these long videos that you see.
There's, uh, a lot of other content
that you can check out, but -
Yeah yeah.
Chop, chop.
I don't, I don't like mullet, so.
It's looking a lot better.
You have school today?
It's Friday.
You, you don't have school? No school.
Is it holiday?
Yeah.
Ah, why, why is it holiday?
I cannot understand English.
No, you speak good English.
You speak good English.
How do you say little in, uh, in
the Philippines?
That's Urdu and Hindi.
Where are you from? 
- Australia.
Are you from Cebu?
Yeah.
Cebu city.
Wait are you,
your dad?
No.
Oh your friend.
You're very, you have a
big age difference to be friends.
You're 35,
and you're 13.
Yeah.
How did you become friends?
You play basketball together?
No.
Ah, does he cut your hair?
Yeah, very good.
Ah, this is very good.
I'm liking it.
It's perfect.
Whenever you come to a, a new country,
especially a country that has like a lot of,
um, difference in culture, you are always unsure if
you're gonna get a good haircut, because you
know, I imagine as I was saying, a lot of
the haircuts here are kind of like fades or
are short on the sides and a fade upwards.
Very good.
Can I also get shave?
Thank you.
Um, so they don't really have like much
experience in this kind of hairstyle.
If I was to go to Australia, a lot of
people have similar kind of hair rights.
So they have experience.
Looking fresh.
Whenever
I get these 
clippers on my beard here always goes in my eyes.
The little, little whiskers.
Here we go, the golden buzzer.
To get it super smooth.
We're going back to the baby face.
What time are you open?
You're open,
everyday?
8 am till, oh 12 hours.
And every day, Monday, Sunday, wow.
Found a perfect spot.
So nice.
Just, uh, a local shop.
And it's good with these videos
is that when I do encounter.
Like kind honest people.
Sorry I'm speaking slowly.
So I don't get cut when I do encounter -
Usually these videos, the people
in the areas end up coming to them.
So like, you know, Amar, for example, in
Pakistan, everybody goes to his jewelry
shop now and gets their jewelry.
And then also the not honest people, those videos
go viral and people don't go to their stores.
But you all know me if you're honest
and, and kind and give me the local price,
and you end up getting rewarded.
Yeah.
All right.
Now we do the, it is clean?
Very good.
So it's kind a three part system.
You get the, uh, the stubble off, then you
get it down, uh, with the golden buzzer.
So it goes this one to get rid of most of
the, the, the hair, then you get the golden.
And then you get the razor.
So this is just to clean it up, make
sure that it is super, super smooth.
And, uh, yeah, we're looking good.
Looking fresh.
I really like the haircut haircut is good.
I'm happy with it.
Perfect length that I wanted.
Um, yeah, I'm happy.
Nice.
Clean up the other side now.
Right just getting the final touches done.
Very good.
I'm looking smart.
Look at all the hair there, guys.
All on the floor.
I don't think that's my hair.
My hair's a little browner.
Oh.
Very good.
I'm looking young again.
I look 20 years younger.
Very good.
Thank you so much, Julius.
That was uh, oh, I'm happy.
I'm happy.
I like it.
How do you say, uh, good or beautiful in?
Yeah.
Good.
Tisoy!
I am looking tisoy.
Yeah I only know a little bit of tagalog.
What does that mean?
Maganda.
Freaky.
Oh pretty!
Maganda.
So I say that to the ladies
on the street, maganda.
All right, guys, we're looking clean.
Got the fresh shave.
Um, yeah, looking about 18 years old,
again as always with the clean shaves.
That tends to happen a lot.
Okay, perfect.
I want to give that to you.
That's for you.
Thanks.
Perfect.
Thank you, Julius.
Thank you, Marky.
You're gonna, let's go play some basketball.
Thank you very much.
I want picture.
Yeah, let's get a

Oh, eight, eight seconds.
Five seconds.
We gotta pose everybody.
Yeah.
All right.
Thank you so much, guys.
Really appreciate it, salamat po.
All right, see you.
- Take care.
Ooh, it's hot outside again.
All right guys.
Oh, look at the, the power lines here they're everywhere.
It's like a big spider web.
Uh, I'm not sure.
