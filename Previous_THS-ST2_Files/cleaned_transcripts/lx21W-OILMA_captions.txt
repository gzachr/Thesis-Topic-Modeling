Hi lolo and lola this is my third try of ice skating
hi guys welcome to another episode of pinay mom's blogs where we share about the
things we do in places we see here
in amsterdam and beyond and though 2019
has come and gone there were a couple of interesting discoveries during the last
couple of weeks in December that
jump-started our year on a new
perspective for instance we realize that
our oldest son is more daring than we
could ever imagine so long as he puts
his head into it in the beginning he
struggled learning how to swim but ice
skating is a completely different story
hi lolo and lola this is my third try of ice skating
that was fun he yeah
we also realized that Christmas in
Amsterdam is no longer immune to
commercialism as I start to see more of
the Christmas spirit and jolliness of
carolers gift-giving ideas and all the
beautiful decorations that it feels more
festive this year than the last as an
example it was such a treat to find a
small Christmas parade in one of the
malls that we spend some family time in
during the weekends
is that cool yeah
and a picture taking with Santa Claus
was even the cherry on top
and since it's the season for Christmas
parties we also notice that our boys are
starting to have their own preference in
clothing and style
speaking of Christmas parties it was our
first time that year to host a Christmas
lunch for some of our non Dutch friends
and their families
and because we're spending the first
Christmas day at my sister-in-law's I
got to prepare a bit early for the party
we ourselves are hosting
ok i'll put the drinks in the natural cooler
in the shed
yeah it's cold out here why not there you go
i have so much more to prepare in such a small
amount of time that I could only film
this part of my work but thanks to my
husband's help we were able to get
everything ready before Christmas Day
December 25 we started the afternoon
with a walk in the woods then a lovely
sit down after dinner with my in-laws
the following day December 26 we hosted
our first ever Christmas lunch and
invited our non-Dutch friends and their
kids and not only was food great but we
also got to try new things
like this Eastern European dumpling
called pierogi this polish marble bread
and a Russian honey cake
but I also made some treats and sweets
for the kids
and they were a bunch i tell ya
that's why Santa got tired in the end
