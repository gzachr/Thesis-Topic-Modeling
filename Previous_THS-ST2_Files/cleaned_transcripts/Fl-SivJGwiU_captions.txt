It was more quantity than I expected and it was delicious. I wanna eat here next time
i
I felt Garlic rice is love always.
Its oily little bit
It's a bit oily, but it doesn't mean it doesn't suit Korean taste.
Since we were native Koreans, it would have been better if we had kimchi
It was totally good ,and i wanna eat here next
Filipino food is still delicious
I'll go to Cebu next month and eat delicious food.
