what about it's a beautiful day here I'm 
going island hopping today I'm still in  
the siargao island and the plan is to visit 
three different Islands now all of them along  
the coast here hello are you the boat man 
okay what's your name okay nice to meet you
so oh it's a shaky boat I guess yeah don't shake 
it too much in the past days it was actually uh  
raining here a lot so this is the first day 
after a few days where we have good weather  
so the perfect uh you speak German actually that's 
funny you live in Germany but you're Filipino yeah  
exactly now exactly I met a Filipino who 
speaks German that's actually quite funny
all right we made it to the first island and 
check out the water here guys oh and the views  
here sun shining clear water oh this is like a 
paradise and yeah I booked this tour like very  
spontaneously like half an hour ago and I'm not 
really sure what's the plan I think the planners  
we're going to hop to several islands and then on 
one Island we also have like lunch later so I'm  
excited what was the name of this island again 
naked naked island I guess you have to go naked
where in the Philippines are you from Cebu Cebu no 
I grew up everywhere yeah I speak bisaya that's my  
first time especially those oh there's fish toys 
you speak German as well that's so funny for me  
I never met a Filipino before I'll speak German 
actually your German is quite okay so it's okay
somebody flying a drone here actually 
there's another there's another drone here  
so yeah this is a tourist uh tour so you see many 
tourists here all these uh boats here that are  
making stops here all day so now we have this 
side with absolutely no people here this is a  
what you think of when you think of paradise right 
Blue Water sunshine blue sky and doing an island  
hopping tour here in the Philippines absolutely 
beautiful and yeah we spent now like half an  
hour here there's not really that much to do as 
you can see and it's also no shade here so it's  
getting pretty hot but off to the next one which 
I think is the one in the background over there
and by the way I will tell you the 
price for two like this uh and my  
opinion if it's worth it or not at the 
end of the video at the end of the tour
what happened
all right off to the next
all right we have made it to the next island 
called I think dark two islands Taco Island  
what does daku mean Big Island ah so this 
is the Big Island yeah it looks nice here
what is the food places over here
that's why
what are they catching here um those are shells 
shells yeah you can eat that it's really good  
what are what why did I catch it they probably 
will sell it or hello so they catch a Celsius
yeah they're going to sell it 
and some they're going to eat  
it also they live here on the 
island oh yeah means from right
yeah
there he is here okay yeah Daddy
from this island yeah okay
but this is a bisaya I'm learning okay okay still 
on the part of the Philippines okay there's a  
little uh Market here maybe so I think we will 
choose fresh fish now and then they cook it first  
oh it's not good in here already so 
uh we can choose what we would like  
to eat and then they prepare yeah so 
they're going to grill it for us okay
oh the grill is already full here 
check it out guys oh big fish is here
I see even chicken on the 
grill here some squid I think
did you wanted the Filipino way the 
Buddha fight like yeah they're going  
to serve it they're going to serve it in 
a Banana Leaf yeah I heard about a bottle  
fight right let's have it the Filipino way 
yeah sure oh so what what are we choosing  
money there's no menu uh the menu is 
basically there we just have to choose  
the menu is basically looking at the food 
and then deciding we can like bite together
okay you guys choose what what 
kind of fish like would you guys
we'll get two fishes I guess it's 
is it uh tuna all of it would be  
nice I would like to try tuna okay 
let's have a tuna let's get a tuna
repeat
yeah that's okay what is it I don't know oh 
that's really good okay we will try it as well  
okay well that's good all right guys it smells 
so good in here everything freshly on the grill  
this is going to be an amazing experiment 
I think another dog walking by here as well
okay so this looks absolutely uh beautiful 
here right guys wow and here we are getting  
one of these Huts they charged 350 if you 
want to get a hutch so this is our Hut
ah okay with the view over the ocean
it's been over an hour since we ordered our 
food so don't get me wrong we're enjoying the  
time here but I'm curious what's going on so let's 
investigate a little bit what's up with our food  
actually the island gets pretty busy now like 
every Hut is now taken lots of Tours arriving  
here all the tour boards full with tourists so 
I guess the kitchen is a little bit busy now  
but let's have a look
I'm preparing food here
oh this looks like a really big one hello hello
yes that looks really good
so I think we are getting 
a table like this as well  
full with all the food I'm wondering uh our food
I'm just wondering how many minutes it needs
foreign
oh okay yeah okay and I'm looking forward 
to try it oh this is so how many people  
is this eight people oh yeah that's a 
lot of food so fish fruits rice noodles  
shrimp everything what is the the best here  
the squids all these shirts spiders spiders 
spiders oh okay I think we ordered that as well  
but the meat inside is only a little 
bit right okay like this yeah okay okay
let's not spoil the surprise too much 
see how it looks when uh when it arrives
but yeah we just spend a lot of time taking a 
lot of beautiful pictures here if you want to  
see some of the pictures I will probably post 
them on my Instagram so it's always worth to  
follow me on Instagram as well if you would 
like to see some behind the scenes of my days  
it looks absolutely nice here wow
so you call this bottle fight Moodle fight
so brutal fight means eating or getting the food 
served like this together you can or if you want  
to have a plate also or you use with a hand 
right yeah yeah oh that looks nice yeah okay
oh that looks really really nice so this is the 
salad I think this is the ordered one salad yeah
okay we have to destroy it now yes please go 
it looks almost too good to uh to destroy it
I'm taking the eye of shiago
to take me out
everyone gets one letter it's two times 
tuna fish right no the other one this is  
the tuna this is the tuna actually it will be 
easier with the hands yeah just use your hands
we need we need a knife would be handy but  
it's okay I love it I think I tried this in 
Malaysia before but you just get it out right yeah
can you maybe hold the 
camera and I'm getting it out  
and this is our vegetable dish and then you 
eat all of this right oh wait you can eat  
all of this yes no no just make sure you don't 
eat the this part right here not to the bottom  
yeah is it like poisonous or something 
no but it's not a really really edible
yeah a bit like like a it's like 
squid I guess like squid yeah and  
gummy gummy gummy that's the word I 
was looking for chewy and gummy yeah
lovely it tastes a little bit like like fresh 
like a fresh kick to it oh fresh from the  
ocean fresh from the ocean this is what like 
those kids got earlier ah right yeah when we  
arrived here the kids yeah just pull it yeah 
just pull it out and yeah that's it and just
okay we have to be careful with the bones 
you under two now the tuna is a little bit  
dry is it supposed to be like that I think they 
they deliver dry but um still it tastes really  
fresh and Meaty it's very dense normally it's very 
dense I think they cooked it too long for too long
there are some bones in here so watch out yeah 
some some bones in the tuna I guess you can just  
keep it short but it's really nice I would like 
to put this on a sandwich actually that would be  
nice the one the tuna under on a sandwich so 
bottle fights are popular in the Philippines  
for like big events so you do that when there's a 
birthday or wedding no this actually started with  
the military this is how they eat like oh okay 
yeah allocation they put the buffet yeah for  
everyone and it's free for all yeah they don't use 
the no utensils yeah and they just eat with their  
hands and they get whatever it is like one big 
plate on banana leaves and everyone just shares  
and usually everyone eats with their hands yes and 
you just dig into it yeah okay okay long all right  
we were not able to finish everything so we have a 
little bit of fish left some squid left some rice  
so it was a lot of food for four persons so we 
just decided we will ask our boat guys like we  
have two guys uh driving us around with a boat 
today so he's just getting the guys you don't want  
to waste the food here so we will invite the boat 
guys to finish the meals What's the total bill
3453
okay so total bill is uh 3453 for this huge 
meal including renting of the heart we had  
here as well all right time to leave this 
island we spent how long now three hours  
here three hours here on this island we arrive 
at I think around 11 right yeah yeah so it's  
now 1 30 or so yeah no do something do 
something already yeah but that's okay  
we don't have any more plants any work to catch 
today so we'll just have to go to kuya oh yeah  
that's it that's the last Island over there that's 
the the small island over there that's going to  
be our next stop by the way I wanted to ask you 
something because you live in Germany here yeah  
I was always curious how is it as a foreigner in 
Germany with communicating in English oh it's all  
right because like I live in Rhineland and that's 
where most of the U.S army bases are from yeah  
so people would normally assume I'm an American 
because of how I speak and normally they're like  
armed with English skills already because they 
know that there are lots of Americans in there so  
it's just that hello because I used to have people 
around that are English-speaking yes ah okay I  
live near spandalem yeah and in Vineland they have 
the Ramstein they're the biggest yes yeah yeah so  
I think that the Rhineland thing yeah okay there's 
people in Rhineland are very nice a very nice uh  
good to hear that you have good experiences 
in Germany yeah so the Filipino people are  
so hospitable to me and so friendly to me so I'm 
happy to hear that you as a Filipino I have a have  
a good experience in my country as well I have no 
complaints that's good to hear that's good to hear  
okay so how many years in Germany already three 
right three years three years yeah oh okay but  
uh here for holiday because you can't get this in 
Germany but we have the mosul river mosul river  
is so beautiful we have the castles we have The 
Vineyards oh he really likes Germany yeah oh yeah  
nice I really love my place and in Germany the 
mosul area mosul wine region yeah we have the wine  
I like that you say we as if it's your home 
already oh I like that yeah I'm at home I'm  
so excited to go home next week but yes how did 
you go back to Germany yes uh yeah the funny  
thing is like some like every time like I travel 
abroad now most of the time I make friends with  
fellow Germans when I was in Prague yeah I was 
traveling alone then I ended up hanging out with  
some Germans oh I know you ended up with me yeah 
like how we met like uh we just met at the pier  
and then we thought I want to share a boat ride 
together yeah so yeah yeah the Germans are here as  
well in the Philippines like the Germans are kind 
of like my Filipinos now if I see another German
foreign okay so where's our boat actually  
I have I don't remember that we walked so 
far but it's probably just here there was  
okay let's see if we can find out 
yeah he's here this one here okay okay
did you receive the food the the food yeah 
okay okay good good okay I don't want to  
waste the good food here so I'm happy that 
they enjoyed it all right let's climb up here

island trip okay off to the next Island

can sit right here we just took some beautiful  
picture here as well The View right here it's 
kind of shining on the face oh my God this is  
what you think of when you think about traveling 
to the Philippines right something like this

what a day actually the last station was raining 
a lot here today we have the perfect weather
playing basketball there okay we 
have a bit of a wavy situation here  
it's dangerous no because earlier 
he said it's a little bit dangerous  
so we have to wait a little bit all right 
last island of the day small and beautiful
okay unfortunately we can't stay here until sunset 
that was our idea but the guys from the boat said  
we need to leave because the waves are coming 
and then it will not be able to leave anymore  
so we have to leave before 
the sunset unfortunately yeah
yeah guys I wanted to fly the Drone and show you 
some drone shot but unfortunately my drone is not  
working yeah because something got into the camera 
I think sand probably so the camera is stuck  
so I can't use the Drone anymore at the 
moment unfortunately the most beautiful  
island that I don't have drone shots now 
but that's life but still beautiful here
