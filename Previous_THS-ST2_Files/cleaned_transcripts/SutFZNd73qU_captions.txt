- So I'm very happy to have Ritchie Tejana
here with us today.
He's a CPA lawyer practicing
for more than 10 years
and also a professor at the
University of San Carlos.
Ritchie, thank you very much
for being here with us today.
- It's my pleasure John to be
part of your YouTube channel.
- Thank you so much.
So I was part of a couple of
other vlog interviews myself
and I mentioned that my
Purple Cow Agency company here
in the Philippines was structured
as a One Person Corporation or as a OPC.
And a lot of you send me messages saying
that you would like to find
out more about the OPC
and what it's about.
I'm obviously not an attorney.
And so I wanted to get an
expert here that would share
with us more about this
important legal structure here
in the Philippines.
So attorney, can you tell us how long
has the OPC been available
here in the Philippines?
- Yeah, well actually this
One Person Corporation
is entirely a new concept in
the Philippine legal system.
It's only been introduced
during the first quarter
of 2019 when the revised
corporation code effect.
- Okay. And is the OPC available
for everybody or only certain people?
- Well, actually any
national person of legal age
whether he is a Filipino or a foreigner
he can form he or she can
form a One Person Corporation
even trust or estates are
allowed to form a corporation.
However, the law
specifically prohibits banks,
pre-need companies, insurance companies,
financial institutions,
and even persons whose
purpose is to practice the profession.
They are not allowed to form
a One Person Corporation.
- Okay, makes sense.
What about before the OPC,
what legal structures
were open for foreigners
if they wanted to start a
business in the Philippines?
- Well, prior to the OPC being introduced
into the Philippine legal system
there are only a limited number
of choices or structures
available for foreigners,
foreigners or foreign
corporations can only
form partnerships, corporations,
at least five incorporators
or foreign corporations may
set-up a Philippine branch
office here in the Philippines.
- Okay. So I have to say informally,
I would hear before about some
situations where it seemed
like the foreigner was the owner
but then there would be Filipinos somewhat
on paper to get things started.
What was going on in the past with that?
- Yeah. The foreigners before
were actually a constraint
or they have no choice, but
to bring over three Filipinos
whether they know them personally or not.
- Sure.
- Or maybe the easier just
acquaintances in order to comply
with the minimum requirements
of the corporation code before
before it was revised.
Because the corporation
code before requires
that for a corporation to be formed
you must have at least five incorporators.
So if you have only one foreigner
then you have to bring in
at least four other members
for you to be able to form a corporation.
- Okay. So the One Person
Corporation, at least for me,
seemed a great option to
start my company here.
But is there any other
reasons why a foreigner
might want to consider a
different legal structure
when starting a business
in the Philippines?
- Yeah. Well, if
if starting a legal
structure in the Philippines
then if you want to have
full control of your business
then I would suggest that you
form a One Person Corporation
because this is the problem before
foreigners in the previous
before the OPC was introduced,
were constrained to bring
over four other members who
have controlling interest.
And it turns out that the
foreigner who is infusing capital,
who really owns a substantially,
the corporation has no
control over his business.
And it's the Filipinos, who have minimal
or no efficient capital at
all, who controls the business.
- Yeah.
- So unlike in a One Person Corporation,
the foreigner can have full
control of his business.
- Okay. Okay.
And then what about in terms
of documents or procedures?
Say someone watching today says sounds
like a great idea to me, but
I have no idea where to start.
Of course, they're going to want to get
in touch with yourself and I'll make sure
and leave your contact information
in the description below
but can you give people
listening a big picture sense
of kind of documents and
where they would need to
start to learn more to start this process?
- Yeah, sure.
The-- in forming a One Person Corporation
the SEC has introduced a online
Company Registration System.
So most lawyers and practicing
professionals get to
access this website of the SEC.
And in that, in that,
in that website actually
or that system of the Securities
and Exchange Commission
you will be needing a lot of documents
at least five documents actually.
You have a cover sheet,
you have an Articles of Incorporation.
You have also a consent letter
from your nominee and alternate nominee.
You also need to fill up a
Foreign Investment Act Form,
it's a specific form of the SEC
and you need to provide your TIN,
if you're a Filipino or
Tax Identification Number
and or passport number,
if you're a foreigner.
- Okay. So I remember
when I filled this out
I had to fill out some things that seemed
as if the Philippines government
was giving that straight
to the US government for things
like taxes that I understand
that right at the time.
- Yes. Yes.
After, after the One Person
Corporation is registered
with the SEC, it also
needs to be registered
with the Bureau of Internal Revenue here.
You also need to secure
a local business permit
for you to operate legally
in the local government unit
where the business will be situated.
And also if you, if the
corporation tends to hire employees
then you need to register your business
with the Social Security System,
with the PhilHealth Corporation
and with the Home Development
Fund or the Pag-IBIG.
- Okay. Okay.
And how long might someone
expect for the process
from beginning to end
take as kind of a range?
- Well, it usually depends on the review
what takes too long is the
review of the SEC lawyers.
Well, the fastest that I had was
after the SEC lawyers reviewed
from the time that we
submitted the documents online
up to the time that the
Certificate of Incorporation
is released by the SEC,
it took me three weeks.
- Okay. That's very fast.
- Yeah.
Yeah.
But maybe that was a small miracle.
What is maybe the longest
that it's taken as well?
- The longest is around
one and a half month.
- Yeah. Okay. That's great.
I have to say when we started
and we were told that we were the first
or certainly I know one
of the first in Cebu, it
it took quite a bit longer
than that, but we set ours
up in 2019 not long
after it was available.
And at that time, banks and others
were still somewhat unaware of the OPC.
So what do you find now, do you think
that most banks and other
institutions are now comfortable
with the OPC and aware
that it's out there?
Or is it still something new for them?
- Yeah. Well based on my experience,
there are still quite a number of banks
and other institutions who
are not yet so familiar
with the one-person
corporation they still require
board of directors resolution.
When in fact in a One Person Corporation
the single stock holder
is also the sole director
and president.
- Right.
Yeah.
- Right, right, right.
But it seems that there's
still a one or two others
that need to have their name,
or is that not, not the case?
- Without the name of the corporation?
- That are on the
paperwork or is it only the
the person that signs up
to it that needs to be on the paperwork?
- Well, in the Articles
of Incorporation, aside
from the single stockholder,
you also need to
have the treasurer to sign
on that Articles of Incorporation.
- Okay. Is the person that owns the OPC
able to be the treasurer as well,
or does that need to be a separate person?
- Yeah. Well the single
stockholder has the option
to be the treasurer himself
or have another, designate another person
to be the treasurer.
But the, if the single stockholder decides
or opts to have himself as
the treasurer at the same time
he needs to put up a bond with the SEC.
- Okay. Okay. Thank you.
So with a lot of other corporations where
it's only one person, for
example, a sole proprietorship
it seems that there's a lot
of liability for the
person that owns that.
But what about with the
One Person Corporation?
Is there any extra protection
for people that have that
compared to a sole proprietorship?
- Yes, actually this is
one very good feature
of the One Person
Corporation because unlike
a sole proprietorship
wherein the personal assets
of the owner is liable
to pay off the debts.
Here in One Person
Corporation, similar to other,
or the same as other corporations
enjoys this limited liability.
It means that his liability
is only limited to his
investment or his capital
investment in a corporation.
- Okay. Very.. very good.
What about taxes?
I know a lot of people are
thinking if I have a company
in the Philippines, will
I have to pay taxes there
or if I'm paying taxes in the Philippines
do I also need to pay that in
the country where I'm from?
Does that, or does that depend
on where somebody is from,
how taxes work with the OPC?
- Yes. For foreigners,
for example, if, whether
it's a foreigner or a foreign
corporation for as long
as the general concept of your
taxation, is that for as long
as you are earning income
here in the Philippines
it will be taxed for any income
tax, any, any income earned
within the Philippines.
For a foreigner, in
his individual capacity
if he earns income here in the Philippines
it will be taxable here in
the Philippines, but not
the income you earned abroad,
but for a One Person Corporation
since it is considered as a
domestic corporations, it is
since it is organized
here in the Philippines
then it's income within the Philippines
and even outside the
Philippines are all taxed.
- Okay. Okay, and is there a tax range
with the OPC or does that really
depend on what people make?
How does that work?
- Yeah. Unlike a natural person
or an individual wherein there is a range
it, that the tax rate right now is ranges
from 15 to 35%.
- Mm-hmm.
- In an OPC, gladly, we just had
a new law, the CREATE law,
Corporate Recovery and Tax
Incentives Enterprise Act.
It rationalizes the tax incentives
and reduces the income tax.
So it, it also benefits
the One Person Corporation
the tax right now for corporations
including a One Person
Corporation is reduced
from 30% to 20%.
- Okay. That's, that's a significant drop.
- Yeah.
That's great. That's great.
Was that motivated you think
by the pandemic or other
reasons or hard to say?
- Yeah, it's actually motivated
by the pandemic it's, we
have the government to
help corporations and
other businesses to recover
from the effects of the pandemic.
- That's great. Yeah.
That's very positive.
What about in terms of the
cost of setting up an OPC?
I'm sure there's some paperwork cost.
Do you know roughly what that is as well?
Is, is there any other costs
that you need to invest
into the company to be able to start it?
- Yes. Well, in terms
we'll, if we're informing
a One Person Corporation
in so far as the SEC is concerned,
you only need to pay a filing fees.
So the filing fees for is 1/2 of 1%
of the authorized capital stock
then also need to pay a 1%
of the registration fee
as legal research fee.
And then, you also need to pay
for the Foreign Investment
Act Application.
That's the FIA application
it's only 3,OOO pesos
and then documents--
- That's $60 US.
- Yes. $60. And then documentary stamp tax
that's only 30 to 50 pesos.
- Okay.
Yeah.
- About a dollar or so US.
- Yeah.
That's great.
And then you mentioned another amount.
So does that depend on
how much is invested
into something particular in the business?
I didn't quite understand
how that part of it works.
- Yeah. The 1/2 of 1% it's
based on the authorized capital.
So it's actually based
on how much money you
put in to your business.
- Okay.
- And does that mean to
start it, for example
overhead or something different?
- Yeah. It's actually the,
the initial capital that you--
because in the, in filling up
the Articles of Incorporation
you are required to state there
how much is your authorized capital
or initial capital that you will put up
or infuse into the business.
- Okay. So does that mean
practically speaking,
if you were to start a restaurant
and it costs 500,000 pesos to start
that that would be your initial capital
is that what's meant by
that practically speaking?
- Yeah. It actually depends
on, it could be more
but that's the minimum
amount share to operate.
- Okay, Okay. Very helpful.
Well, I know we've covered a number
of topics that others asked me.
Is there anything else that you can think
of that we haven't covered
that would be important
for people to know
about the OPC or doing
business in the Philippines?
- Yeah. Well, in the,
in the Philippines, I
I encourage Filipinos and other
foreigners to take advantage
of this new concept, introduced
it to the legal system
by shifting your businesses
into a One Person Corporation.
Because aside from the limited liability
advantage,
you can actually have your can
protect your personal assets.
You can just invest so.. so much assets
or so much capital to your
one-person corporation
and then your personal
assets will not be touched
even garnished with the
BIR because what happens
to other businesses, if
you're a sole proprietorship
the BIR can garnish even
your personal assets
even your personal bank accounts.
But if you are into a One
Person Corporation, the BIR,
if supposing, in the worst case
that there is a tax evasion
case against the corporation,
it can take, the BIR can only freeze
or garnish the bank
accounts of the corporation
but never your personal bank accounts.
That's what happened to Manny Pacquiao.
- Yeah?
Yeah.
Because when he, when
there's tax evasion case
filed by the BIR against him
all his bank accounts,
personal bank accounts
were frozen by the BIR.
- Wow.
- So when you have an OPC you can protect
your personal assets.
- That's really great to know
for those of you in the US,
US the BIR is the equivalent
of the IRS, or yeah,
other bodies and other
countries dealing with tax.
- So it's a tax authority
here in the Philippines.
- Yes. Yeah. That's a great safeguard--
- Yeah.
- for those who have a OPC.
- And also in terms of taxes,
if you are an individual
your taxes would range
between 15% to as high as 35%.
But if you are an OPC,
you're only be paying a straight
amount or fixed rate of 20%
of your tax of income.
- Okay. So does that
also mean that it can't
be lower than 20%?
- Yeah, it can be lower
than 20% for as long as
you have a taxable income.
The tax rate now is
reduced from 30 to 20%.
- Okay. Okay, good to know.
- But if you were registered
with the Philippine Economic
Zone Authority or PEZA
or under the Board of
Investments, the BOI,
you can enjoy actually income tax holiday
0% for a certain number
of years, four years
seven years then after that
they can just be paying
or just be paying 5% on
your gross income tax.
- Yeah, it's very good.
So I have a feeling that those
listening would also be
really interested to hear
about PEZA especially when they hear some
of the tax benefits with that.
So if you would be willing,
I'd love to have you
on the channel at a future time
to talk about PEZA as well.
- Yeah, sure.
I'll be willing to
share my knowledge about
PEZA registration or BOI registration
and it's incentives and advantages.
- Sounds great.
I look forward to that.
