- Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen,
to another episode of Scenic Fights:
Fight Scene Breakdown.
(action movies sound effects)
I'm Logan Lo.
- Chad VÃ¡zquez.
- Today, we're breaking
down a kali sequence,
a kali sequence, from "Moon Knight".
This is a really short,
but awesome sequence
that is packed with kali.
I cannot wait to beat up Chad.
- Wait, what?
Okay, that's fair.
- Yeah.
You know, I need a white suit.
- Here we go, running, running, running.
- Right?
- Boom!
Wrestling style, baby, yeah.
- Punyo.
Double fluid attack.
Roof block.
More punyo attacks, knee attack.
Man, there's so much going on here.
- Nice flipping.
- Exactly.
I'll let you do that part.
Nice, now Mr. Knight becomes Moon Knight.
- Okay, awesome scene, but a short one.
- Well it's short,
but man, there are a
ton of kali moves here.
And that's one of the
things about weapons work.
It happens so quickly.
Let's watch that again,
and I'll try to break it
down as we're doing it again.
- All right, let's do it, then be it.
- What?
All right, so Mr. Knight
just did a punyo attack.
- What's a punyo?
- That's a great question.
It's both a noun and a verb,
at least in our school.
And it's the end of the weapon,
so the butt of the weapon,
but it also means to stab
with a thrust.
- Oh, okay.
- So that is a punyo.
Okay, so the very first attack
that Mr. Knight does in this sequence
is a punyo attack.
But he does it kind of
like a superman punch.
It looks something like this.
He comes up and pops
him, right in the neck.
So my one criticism of that move is that,
with a blunt object, it's
not a finishing blow.
Someone like Chad, as you just saw,
is just gonna shrug that off.
So after that initial strike,
I would follow up with a secondary strike.
It's the secondary strike
that would finish the fight.
The first punyo would
really only stun the person
and not finish the fight.
Note that, with a pointy
weapon, it's a fight finisher.
Here, if I launch this
into Chad, he's done.
I'm done, and I can move on.
So a punyo with a pointy weapon, one blow.
With a blunt weapon, I
would need multiple strikes.
What Mr. Knight did was not wrong at all.
It just wasn't a fight finisher.
The person he hit would
not have been finished.
Again, not accounting
for supernatural power.
Okay, so now we have a fluid attack
where both weapons are
on one side, and he does
a simultaneous attack.
- Okay.
- He's striking the guy's weapon arm,
and he follows with a
double strike to the knee,
moves on to the next guy.
Mr. Knight does what
we call a fluid attack,
where both weapons start on one side.
The benefit of this is, he
can do simultaneous attacks.
He can do, as he did,
double strikes to the leg.
He can also do double strikes to the head.
He can also do a strike to the
head and a strike to the leg
at the exact same time.
He can also do it twice.
That's the benefit of
doing a fluid attack.
Now, let's see it in action.
In this sequence, Mr. Knight starts
with his weapons on the right side.
Note that he strikes the
gun arm with his right hand,
but he's too far to do
anything with his left hand.
That's fine.
Now both weapons end up on his left side.
He follows up with a
double attack to the leg,
and then moves on to the next assailant.
What could he have done differently?
Now on the forehand attack, it was fine
because he could only
reach with the top hand
and couldn't reach with the bottom hand.
But that enabled him to
chamber on the other side.
Now his weapons are
chambered on the left side.
Again, he launched two leg attacks.
But what I personally would have preferred
is a simultaneous head and leg attack.
Why?
Because when you strike
the person in the head,
that's a fight ender.
Here we go.
And now, Mr. Knight is ready
for the next assailant.
That's something we call a roof block.
See, this thing is packed with kali moves.
Here, Mr. Knight does a roof block
and follows up with a
slash to the stomach.
It looks like this.
He comes in, boom, there's the attack.
And here's his attack.
Note that the weapon
would really slide down.
That's fine when I have a guard on.
But when I don't have a
guard, bad things happen.
Let me switch weapons
with Chad so you can see.
Here, Mr. Knight blocks that weapon
and then strikes the person's body.
But that's not what would
happen in the real world.
That's a crowbar being swung with rage.
That crowbar would slide down
and crush the finger and thumb.
That's the reality of what would happen
with this type of roof block.
This is not the type of
roof block you wanna do
unless you're really superpowered.
What would be a better option?
A better option would
be a real roof block,
and it looks like this.
The assailant comes down
with the diagonal number one.
This is a real roof block.
Note that the weapon
slides off away from me.
You always want to be
moving away from danger,
never towards danger.
And that's what Mr. Knight
should have done in this exchange.
Let's assume arguendo that
that was a proper roof block.
He comes in with a diagonal number one.
It's blocked this way.
So here, Mr. Knight pushes the assailant
back with his left arm,
using him as a defensive shield,
just like we saw in
"The Man From Nowhere",
while still launching
attacks with his right hand.
That was good.
What I would have preferred
though is that same block,
and then that same clearing,
but an attack from the flank,
finishing this person
and moving on offensively
rather than defensively.
Mr. Knight just follows up
with a bunch of punyos to the throat.
Oh, flying knee, okay.
We did the flying knee in
"Captain America: Winter Soldier".
- This is correct.
- Right?
And you did that to me.
That was a lot of fun.
And then here, we have another
not-so-great roof block,
and he follows up with a
slash to the guy's arm.
And oh, we're kind of doing
a Sinawali drumming pattern
like we saw in "Raid 2"
with Hammer Girl, right?
- Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
- Okay, let's beat up Chad.
Let's break that down.
In this next exchange, Mr. Knight
does the same inferior roof block.
Let's assume it works, however,
for the purposes of this scene.
He comes in, blocks, and attacks,
comes in, and follows up
with simultaneous attacks
to the upper body, like
a drumming pattern,
what we call Sinawali.
We've seen Sinawali before,
which basically means, to weave.
It's when two arms
are simultaneously
attacking and defending.
So if you've not seen our breakdown
of the "Raid 2" Hammer
Girl, take a look at that.
But briefly, it's when you're
simultaneously attacking
and defending with two weapons.
There are many things that you could do.
Here, Mr. Knight was
blocking and attacking,
blocking and attacking,
and then attacking with double hands.
That was really cool, and
I'm glad to see it again.
(action movie sound effects)
Honestly, guys, I loved this series.
I inhaled the entire series in one night.
That's how much I loved it.
Moon Knight is actually one
of my personal favorites
way back when, when I was
a nerd reading comic books.
I'm still a nerd reading
comic books, but older.
I thought the way Oscar
Isaac did it was phenomenal.
But as I said, it's not without its flaws.
As we saw with the inferior roof block,
I didn't really enjoy that.
So because of all this, I
give it a solid A minus.
I can't wait for season two.
There's a season two, right?
