they can be pretty brutal yeah you know
they might have two or three of you on
the go did your family expect you to pay
for them as well they have heard some
bad stories out there but mine's a good
story that's a genius idea
hi what's your name Jeff Thomas uh where
are you from UK what brings you down
here to the Philippines
friends wedding in Manila in 2016
. wow 2004 and did you ever go back or
did you stay here since then a couple of
times but then uh once I was here that
was it I love the place okay and what do
you love about not so much Manila but
more Cebu
what do I love about it yeah
climate of course yeah but the people
okay the people there's no language
barrier they're all
right lovely I've never had a problem
here with
local people yeah that's good A lot of
people are a bit wary about new
environment basically what is it about
the people that make them special here
they can't help enough yeah I've been in
I've been in different groups off-road
motorcycling I've come off in the
mountains
burn my leg trying to get up you see
nobody and all of a sudden there's 20
people trying to help you ah from where
I don't know you try to give them money
yeah no no no you don't want you know I
experienced that myself recently in
Manila somebody very very uh courteous
without wanting anything from me yeah I
mean
it is difference between between the
city and the province because
that of course
there are levels of corruption any
anywhere yeah uh and the city is more
more so than the province because they
haven't got to that they don't know okay
they're just nice people want to do good
things they go to church they're all you
know
they wouldn't have to fly sort of thing
but uh in my experience
because some people have had bad
experience maybe they deserve it
depends what you get yourself into right
okay so you're here for
options together six experiences 2008.
otherwise the real estate broker uh and
we've had business here for 12 years in
real estate oh nice you got a business
here we'll get to that in a second tell
me a little bit about being married to a
Filipino or being in a relationship with
one is any different than uh girls in
the UK
the first time we're married yeah which
is hard for some people I guess but
first time I heard the last time life is
fantastic yeah
I can't see what the bad thing about it
I mean a bad relationship in the UK yeah
they're good they're different for sure
here if they love you they love you okay
unconditionally let's see there's past
experiences like yeah I think I love you
but um
yeah maybe not so unconditionally yeah
that's why there's so many people coming
over I think to Asia like this whole
like passport Bros movement and all that
Asia on the whole I'd say they're
probably all loving kind caring people
but Philippines especially
and they've got the language yeah so
there's no language about it but if you
look at it I mean I know if you're good
look at Germany UK anywhere a lot of the
nurses and doctors are from the
Philippines yeah definitely because they
are carrying they're caring risks yeah
so even in Canada a lot of Filipino
nurses and they're not teachers and
everything okay now a little bit about
her family are you close with your
wife's family yeah yeah my mother died a
few years back married she was a I
actually knew the family before I met my
life okay so it was a crazy I lived in a
province
for a couple years before I met my wife
but I used to play football with some
people were a Swedish guy
and I met my wife went on a date for
dinner
so if you lived in Mobile yeah if you
know Mika I said yeah I play Pokemon the
Swedish guy oh that's my brother-in-law
the what oh you have a family before I
met my wife okay I'm just kind of kind
of strange and otherwise nothing was the
barangay captain and it kind of well
respected within that community so yeah
basically mine's a good story okay I've
heard some bad stories out there but
yeah mine's a good one now I hear some
nightmare stories about family
expectations is that true like does your
family expect you to pay for them as
well no
um yes and no I I have never I guess I
was lucky because
real life
he set the standards before I got
involved in that family sort of thing
but they've never asked for anything but
they're all establishing their own right
so remember in those lto the traffic
department
um so yeah they're successful in their
own right so I've never been asked okay
I do know other people that yeah
you know it'll cost you ten thousand
just to
you know
again
that's that's good for some people not
for not for others yeah definitely
a part-time relationship you go back to
the voice of your own country
yeah you know they might have two or
three of you on the go I think I need
you to get paid them ten thousand a
month or whatever so they're doing very
well but they're loyal to you when
you're here yeah but that's just
that's the game well it makes sense no I
I understand fully you have do you have
kids do you have kids one dog one dogs
are very uh take a lot of
responsibilities sometimes for 14 years
okay which is uh yeah no kids
unfortunately okay and what's the age
gap between you and your wife
she's 42. I'm I'm 25.
I'm 55. okay so not so bad it should
break some other relationships I guess
okay and do you live in the city or in
the province area yeah just behind where
where am I up on the Mountainside there
okay
so you've been here almost 20 years have
you seen any major changes in the city
itself
you wouldn't recognize this ten years
ago just high rises it's building faster
yeah very fast okay now you have a real
estate business here now right so what's
your advice for someone that wants to
come here and wants to start their own
business or work in the Philippines
maybe you could tell them
yeah I've been asked that so many times
I've actually I've got
I'm in real estate I've got a
construction company I've got a portable
toilet business okay that's a genius
idea
I mean basically and it's still the same
now
I've probably been local business
everyone copies everyone else yeah yeah
I've seen that yeah so next door is the
same thing and then there's no profit
the same thing
come from the rest of the world if you
like
there's many things here that don't
exist well we have investment it doesn't
exist here like for instance affordable
toilets yeah which
when we set up construction and build a
house
I tried to get appointments on it yeah
one company and they only had five units
and they're all fully rented out so
that was the next step
but I mean there's lots of things here
that
you think was what we used to at home I
mean this is on Netflix yeah but
what you think is every day
it should be it's not here
maybe that's a good business idea
um a lot of positive things any negative
things some things that could be
improved I know there's a lot but what
are your personal dislikes about the
Philippines
um
well that's the same anyway there's
corruption yeah for sure and to do
business here sometimes you have to
look the other way or you know give an
envelope or something just to get things
done yeah yeah but that's the same
anyway yeah for sure I mean you don't
see it so much but it happens
and I mean
the worst thing that can happen here is
you get on the wrong side of a female
and they can be pretty brutal yeah any
stories you want to share anything
you've heard about something to like I
mean
yeah I I had an X uh it was lovely until
she wasn't
and then it was like
I had to go over there I said I I've
heard from friends you know she's my
wife accused me of having drugs she
could have played drugs she could lose
that I got locked up for a day but it
was all okay
of course
after I'd left her three months later oh
but I still love you it's uh I'm like
yeah
it can be a bit too
let's say love you they love you forever
it seems a little bit too clingy you
know even if it's not I mean now my wife
for instance
she's not that late she's so you know
professional business woman and if I was
to mess up
she'd leave tomorrow yeah
but it's never been that bad so yeah
it's just like
it's more of a joke but I know that she
would but she could actually survive she
doesn't need me we need each other
that's great to know okay excellent
okay did you obviously have a life here
don't you miss something from back home
or anything at all not really um
I mean Devin ensormel surfing years ago
uh
the countryside
it's beautiful of course absolutely and
it's beautiful here but then
garbage okay garbage on the side of the
street not so much in the city but
outside there's plastic everywhere you
get certain certain beaches you go to
it's just plastic yeah but you don't see
it we may be doing certain parts of UK
though but not from my experience before
but then I've not been in the UK for
68 years so I'm going to be back a
couple times but
so I wouldn't really know what's what's
changed in that in that respect the West
country
you know sit by you know Exeter City
close to that beautiful cities you don't
get that here yeah you can go to certain
places we've got some Spanish history
that's nice
Iloilo and various other places
but a lot of the Spanish
it was all torn down
which is a shame there's a lot of
history is gone
but that's that's it really
take a break from sweating you know I
don't know how you handle the heat man I
still took 14 years I know but I spent
like three years for me this different
place and I still got her like carry one
of these around and just to
um where do you recommend someone is
looking for a Filipino wife to meet them
because online can be hit or miss to be
honest right so what's your best
suggestion for someone looking to
actually have a true love or like wife
like yourself
don't look
is it gonna be the right one who knows
of course I'm going to say wait where to
go look a bank
yes she's got a good profession yeah
like this
um any business that you want to promote
so people can go ahead and follow you or
check you out here in the Philippines
well if you're looking for abruptcy it's
a rental or for sale
um Cebu probably sales and rentals is my
business my wife
um other than that
is it difficult to buy property here if
you're not married in Florida you cannot
own land you can own the property on the
land and you can rent a landing on the
property but you can't own the land
unless you go through a corporation
you can lease longer term 25 years
that's a lot of people do
or you can get married or if you're
friends that you trust that you put in
there but not advisable I was gonna say
you got to really trust somebody for
that right okay rentals and honestly I
wouldn't be coming a blind to just buy I
would rent in a few areas find out where
you like and then decide whatever you
want to buy or stay where you are
great advice thank you so much for your
time and I really appreciate that
leave your comments down below let me
know what you think of Jeff's story his
experience in the Philippines and share
your thoughts if you take your time to
write it I take time to respond now for
me personally I've not been here for 20
years but there are some things I've
noticed here even in the past few years
that have changed a little bit Cebu City
specifically is really really developing
and growing really fast I see many
different condos developments different
projects going up all around the city
and one other thing I noticed the
traffic is getting really heavy in Cebu
cities so keep that in mind if you're
trying to live here long term I highly
recommend staying within the city
centers like Ayala business park or it
Park something like that so you're very
close to all the amenities and some of
the different stores that you want to
