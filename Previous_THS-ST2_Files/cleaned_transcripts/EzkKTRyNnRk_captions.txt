Good Morning .. Good Morning
We have Greg Secker with us this morning
Have a seat Greg, thank you.
Greg Secker is from London, and how long have you been here?
Three days. Three days, anyway Greg is here to
talk about Learn to trade. Now of
course we all know that we're able to
earn a little money and put it in the
bank and then but the the interest is
not really that attractive to make our
savings grow.
Now how do we do this with Learn to Trade?
Well it's funny actually you should say that
most people don't realise how low
interest rates really are.  Across
Europe at the moment interest rates are
about 25 basis points was about
0.25%. But inflation is running at
1.1% your actually your money is rotting if you
live in other words you most people
don't understand what inflation is which
means that you can buy less, this
time next year, with the money you have
now if you don't do something useful
with it and it's kind of funny we never
came to the Philippines to bring Learn
to trade here, so to Learn to trade is the
largest trader education company in the
world today so were having trading floors
and training centres all over the world
in Johannesburg, South Africa, in London,
in Sydney Australia, we came here following
typhoon Haiyan that's Yolanda you know
Yolanda locally to you, yeah it's
actually landed hit on my son's birthday so
on the 9th of November, the next day my
housekeeper and her and her partner who
are from the Philippines were devastated
you know everybody was devastated and we
made a commitment to come out here and
and rebuild some of their family homes
and then from coming here and meeting
the people that we suddenly decided to
take the effort to the next level of
course yes and then all of a sudden we
really looked at me said look if we just
give people nice shiny houses how useful
is that really gonna be when you know
these people don't want to start it's
just survive we want them to thrive so
how can we help them you know really
progress just from sugar cane farming
and rice farming to something a little
bit more lucrative and certainly more
sustainable and so somebody said in my
team as they always do somebody said why
don't we teach them to trade the
currency market that's what we do have
been doing this for nearly
twenty years, we teach private
self-directed individuals normal people
in the street how to trade a currency
accounts and this is buying and selling
foreign currencies and make a
sustainable income from doing it.  I've been
doing it for  20 years.  I run one of the highest
performing currency hedge funds, and
when I left the banking world because I
just got tired of it,  well you guys know what
early mornings are about I think I got up at 3am
this morning just to be here. But I
started teaching people, friends and
family when I made a lot of money my
twenties doing this, and I started
teaching people to do it and I had quite
fun, quite a lot of fun doing and set up
a little trading floor in a training centre
and it just grew very very quickly , we've had about
quarter of a million people in the last 15 years
who've been through our programs.
So somebody said well if we're going to
build this village wouldn't it be a bit
crazy to put a trading floor literally
out in the jungle I mean this is in Iloilo,
in Lemery
and so we said well if we were
going to trial this in the
Philippines why don't we run some
seminars in Manila and see how it goes
and it went huge, I mean literally
last year we threw some seminars they
were something like 3,000%
oversubscribed, so this happens to
be so we just launched learn to trade in
Manila, literally six months ago we
have the largest trading floor and
training center that we've ever built
three times the size here in the
Philippines because the demand here is
massive I I never knew.
I thought there was lots of private
traders here I mean there's lots of private
Japan is the largest currency
trade private currency trading market in
the world and we're not a million miles
from here and so I naturally thought
people here would be doing it
nobody's doing it here, so how do we do it
well
by working with some of the most
successful traders in the world.
Understanding what they're looking
for and its really understanding what
currencies to buy when to sell them and
there are certain things that happen in
the currency markets every day and today
it's all about computer so everybody today has
access to a laptop
and the computing power of a laptop
today with the right trading software
can literally put your side by side
with some of the super funds,  and so we
teach regular people how to do it and
when the key is keeping the risk low but
then really letting the software find the
trades and we find within about three
days we can get somebody up to a
standard where they understand
how to use the software and then what we do
which is probably different to what
anybody else does is we're a company
which is built by traders for traders so
the way it works is it's a real graduate
referral scheme so you come in you learn
how to do it, and then you have to go sit on
the trading floor one-on-one with a
professional trader and trade live with
them and we built the trading floor here
in Manila we're going to build a trading
floor literally in the jungle and
get and get the people out there doing
it too. So the decision-making process
in whether to buy or sell a particular
foreign currency or whether it's a stock
is left to the individual that you're
teaching how to the trade.
Well not really, because they would be so
inexperienced they wouldn't know what they're doing
so there are certain things that
happen in the currency markets at specific times
the currency markets really split into three zones
you want to think of it as Asia which is
Australasia and Asia,
EMEA which is Europe and Eastern Africa of
course the Americas, and it's a 24-hour
market and it's trades non-stop all the
time. One country is sleeping but then another
country is awake
that's right it's just the way it goes
and when one when them two countries
overlap say for example at lunchtime in
in the UK America's waking up and you
got two-thirds of the currency market if
they're both betting on the same
direction on the same currencies there
are certain signals but really hardcore
fast operating algorithms can pick up
and alert the individual, but it
don't forget we're teaching beginners
you know they wouldn't know what to do
so it shows them where to get in
that's the entry price where to get out
for profit where to get out if it
doesn't go well and and this is all
happens in a split second shows the
trade they ok it, and then the system
manages the trade to completion so it's
kind of funny how it all happened
because we built the software we have a
very successful hedge fund, it did 41%
last year and we built some software for
hedge fund traders and then we said what
could we develop a bit further so
somebody like my mother could actually
place trades, and my mom has no interest
in trading whatsoever
when i started this
20 years ago I was a I was a grad student from a Vet
College so I was gonna be doing veterinary,
I did some courses in IT, I end up by serendepity
on this trading floor in London
supporting one of the most prolific
currency traders that time trading 38
billion years my job is to make sure if
his computer crashed I had to get the
machine up and running as quickly as possible
and by spending time in that very
bizarre fish tank of currency traders
I learnt a few of the tricks and the
tricks really are understanding which
currencies move at certain times and how
to understand the signals and then of
course be an IT guy I programmed into
software and could teach regular people how to do it.
And of course and Greg outside Learn to Trade
you also have a foundation
yes and what is this Greg Secker
Foundation?  Well its funny, its a foundation
that I started seven years ago, I have
three kids 8, 5 and my daughter's 3
nearly four but she's kind of going on
10, she rules the house as all girls do... so I'm quite
big into child empowerment and I set
up a process called the Global Youth
Leadership Summit. We take in 2,000 kids a
year from the age of 13 and 17 mostly
from disadvantaged backgrounds we put
them in nature, so we build a
village like a temporary village, a thousand
tents for girls, 50 security guards
a thousand tents for boys, if you know what I mean
12 hours a day, and we fly in top motivational gurus
experts in their field in the areas
of health, wealth, leadership
entrepreneurship, contribution and
relationships, and these are really all
the subjects that you aren't traditionally
taught at school and from that we got quite
a following so we do this all over the
world and then when typhoon Yolanda, as
you call it locally here,  hit my
lovely dear friend Rosario, who manages
my whole empire at home she's a quite
quite an amazing lady and was just in
tears.  I'm an early bird I wake up at
five in the morning, I came down to the
kitchen she was just in fits, and I
said whatever is going on, you know,  she
said oh no I don't want, oh, its Yolanda
and I said whose Yolanda?
and she said, oh no Yolanda, and we started to sit down
tell me about it and she said, no, no, no what do you
want for breakfast and I said I dont want anything for
breakfast I want to know what's going on
with you and she said look you know my
two brothers, they've got many kids each you
know they just lost their homes, and I said where are
they living?  Well they're living in
a disused school at the moment, you know, and
so she said there's nothing we can do
and I said, well there is something we can do,
and at the time I picked up the phone to
my the chairman of the CEO of our
charity and I said we've got to do
something the Philippines this is just
hectic out there millions of millions of
people are in trouble thousands of people
lost their lives we gotta get out there
and she said , oh no no no, Greg you got to understand our charities
all about children empowering kids
and I said, don't give me all that I said
sure you get you can a heart as well and
so I said book the flights so we
literally book the flight and we left
the next day we landed here we built
these the proper home using type in
resistance concrete walls to go past the
roof the roof don't get ripped off and
examine and then really just by spending
time here we become at the people and we
said well how can we leave this area
when two families have been given a home
but nobody else has
yeah and so we said look we we can't do
that because probably those people will
be disenfranchised from their community
they got a nice house else it so it kind
of took a dustbin lid and we did a
circle around this area which the live
ones get home so it's 458 people it's a
hundred houses they are hard them in
their top quality items they're here we
wanted you know I don't believe you can
teach and help people who are starving
yes this in last year last year that
yeah and this needs how much a person
that's really able to reach that sorry
how many were you able to build with
than 50 so far we have a hundred
completed in july but we're not stopping
there with building a school building a
farm building a training center because
we don't want to hand over keys were
trying to create model of reciprocation
yes these folks will look after the
village prepare for their families will
inherit the homes gonna be a being that
the lives need they lost after the
high-end year and we're trying to make
it a an example to the charity sector
you know it's been many examples in the
past the favelas in Brazil
yes um the Nelson Nelson Mandela schools
it's about the which you know which
became derelict and then became crack
dens and that's because they didn't put
sustainability program in place we way
we operate is we when we teach people to
trade for lunch trade program we make a
commitment to them which all we ask them
to commit to us to do one day of
philanthropy a month so we run something
called a trader thought where we all
trade for 24 hours you get pizza and
coca-cola and we're all sitting around
screen and whatever whatever money we
make us from let's trade we give to our
foundation but all of the delegates all
of our clients are graduates they keep
their profits but the brokerages give us
all the Commission's on that one day and
it's quite interesting on that one day
into hours we make enough money to build
a house for a family of five
mhm and in the space of about six hours
we build enough so we make enough money
to build a school
wow so it really ties the the graduates
into you know a little bit about giving
back but about paying it forward and
also kind of galvanized are not into
soon
ok so again to entice our viewers please
invite them to learn to trade and the
foundation in order to help be forward
your advocacy is here and what we're
doing is quite special actually we have
just set up a brand new series of
compliments tree and training seminars
that people have to spend any money they
come along the two hours they'll see a
professional multi millionaire trader

showing exactly how they can do it and
so when we running these all over the
Philippines if they go to learn to trade
dot-com dot ph they can sign up for free
to attend to 72 hours they can meet with
one of the traders and see if it's for
them there's they're going to tell you
the demand has been incredible
when will be the next and iron at the
