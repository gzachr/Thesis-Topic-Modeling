really really really excited about it's just been 
uploaded about uh a couple of days ago on the 16th  
this is my set a month and this is i believe a 
live kind of studio performance and the song is  
called power and it was taken from the miss 
university universe philippines um in here  
in her uh channel and i've gone straight to a 
channel not any other platforms um it says here  
not a lot of people know that when i perform this 
at the moa arena for the coronation of 2022 miss  
universe for the philippines we didn't have our 
session in the studio yet since i literally just  
came from the usa um the us for a recent 
tour standard practice would be we would  
call a song with to also somewhat master the 
track first before even performing it live  
but it was uh excellent everyone said reception 
and it took us a while rather than go finally  
to get into the studio due to somewhat return of 
normality um nowadays and getting ourselves loaded  
with work we initially already had a day to record 
this track with uh my cooler clutch um is that  
my cuda it's where is that my good that actually 
the um the famous no it can't be um i was written  
under the weather and caught the flu which is also 
affecting my voice we hadn't to postpone weeks  
past and on this day i was in the studio with 
dave working on some stuff when i randomly said  
we should try and recall power again okay and 
mind you we had other plans that evening but this  
was just a spirit of the moment kind of thing 
perks of having our own studio damn right ladies  
he opened the session and this um right here was 
our very first take of course we did several more  
after that and finished in just around 20 minutes 
are you serious girl um i decided to shoot with  
my phone just for memory sake but this turned out 
better than before and i just wanted to share this  
with you on her phone first take actually done a 
number of other takes and it took 20 minutes and  
i'm just about to hear master at work come on i'm 
very excited i can't wait to press the play button  
i really can't look if you haven't done already 
please subscribe to my channel don't forget to hit  
the notification button to indicate to you where 
my next uploads will be now without further ado  
you know what we're here for great vocabs and 
a damn good feature audio music can you dig
yeah i've been sick for days i 
said when i was reacting to um
gabrielle enrique gabriel enrique that 
i would love to see these two have a  
bad collaboration i'm gonna 
break it i'm gonna make it mine
this voice inside now you can 
hear it i know the choice is mine
i've got this
she's gonna take a step
you can tell how much this song means
and she's going to execute this good songs that 
inspire so many inspired so many women come on
see what i mean
and look at this
i've got the best of both worlds
don't just do that
she's making her vocals
okay
she just made that studio
no you just didn't do that yeah
and what's what you just witnessed there wasn't 
a um you know a 2 million 2 million or 2 million  
pound studio where you know it's got all 
the flamboyance and all that kind of stuff  
she can rock anywhere she can rock anyway 
she just made that studio for a billion  
yeah there's so many people just got their studios 
in a room or in a shed or in a bedroom anywhere  
means necessary as long as you've got the the 
apparatus to to do your recording you know  
that's from a producer's point of view then you've 
got an artist that's been to many many studios  
yeah come on you know with a voice like us and 
what's been consistent advice hasn't changed by  
the depth of the surroundings you know have the 
surroundings change by the adaption of her vocals  
that's what i'm getting at so you can see 
a sing in a box room or something like that  
and when she opens her mouth she 
makes that box room feel like a palace  
because that room for me felt like a palace is 
like unbelievable what you just done in that room  
you just put so much energy and so much positive 
um that's in that room by your frequency by your  
by your smile by your presence by your aura you 
just lifted up that whole room the engineer and i  
don't know what his name is apologies for that but 
he must have been in some kind of serious la la  
land the way how we are when we watch but he was 
actually there can you imagine how you feel when  
you're so close to my set mom and she does that i 
don't know if i'll break down her cry or i have no  
idea or walk out or pass out i have no idea it's 
almost like when she sings you know like you've  
got these prophets that you go to church and they 
touch you and you they they get rid of the demons  
you know i bless you and all that but i just feel 
like was singing to you and she'll cast away any  
kind of demons that you have in your soul in your 
body her notes will resonate right through you  
you know and just bless you with some serious 
notes and it will just take out any kind of demons  
or whatever have you that's on your back because 
she's just pure you know when you have a vocal  
like that and she's smiling and it's effortless 
um you know and when she's finished she's not like  
you know like she's smiling y'all she's smiling 
just like just like a seven-year-old with a  
smile richard run to the daddy's or mommy's 
mommy's arm it's just blessed with purity  
and for that reason we have just we just 
been in luxury y'all we are the very very  
we have this we're just sitting in luxury we're 
really we are and we should be absolutely grateful  
that we have have got an amazing artist that 
brings so much sunshine to the world with her  
vocals i haven't seen an artist do that in 
a very very very uh long time of her calibre  
i know there is many great artists and really 
great great singers and amazing singers but  
there's only a handful of singers when they sing 
it affects your soul and it affects your heart  
and she's definitely one of them and 
for that reason i salute you i'm amazing
oh
