You remember the Philippines the
last trip made by a president
that turned out to be not so good.
Never quite got to land.
The relationship with the past
administration was horrible to use a
nice word.
I would horrible
is putting it mildly. You know what
happened.
Many of you were there.
You never got to landâ€” the plane
came close, but it didn't land.
Walk us through exactly what
happened here.
Well, Jim we do want to start by
warning
everyone the language from the
Philippine
leader is graphic.
He issued a direct challenge to
President
Obama and President Obama not
taking kindly to any
of
it.Until the drug
manufacturer is killed,
we will continue and I will continue
and I
don't give a s**t about anybody
observing my behaviour.
I don't have any
master except the Filipino people.
Nobody but nobody.
You must be respectful. Do not just
throw away questions and statements.
Son
of a
whore, I will swear at you at that
forum.
I just heard about some of this
but I have seen some of those
colorful statements in the past.
And so clearly
he's a colorful guy.
The Philippines is a treaty ally of
ours.
But I always want to make sure that
if I'm having a meeting
that's actually productive
and we're getting something done.
We will always assert
the need to have
due process and
to engage in that fight
against drugs in a way that's
consistent with basic
international norms.
And so,
undoubtedly,
if and when we have a meeting that
this
is something that's going to be
brought up.
