sweet potato okay it's just like um I don't know  
what that is it looks like a star yeah like 
a green vegetable that's kind of cool there's  
something else in here which I don't even know 
what I just ate because it's hurry so it's hard  
to tell what everything is it looks good though 
I think it's like I think it's hot right okay all  
right all right wow hopefully you can kind of eat 
around it it looks like big chunks of vegetables  
so you're good that way yeah big sweet potato 
chunks nice and Boris how's your hot dog going
it was actually
the way it goes sometimes all right so I 
got I got this basically the brown rice  
I'm gonna go with the granite style and just 
kind of Lop it all together egg is cooked on  
a medium which is perfect the way I like 
it not too runny and I got this big chunk  
of ham and like I fried it uh really well 
let's see if I can uh get a bite of that
all right kind of that first bite
hmm
even that fried ham has a sweet flavor to it 
so guys what do you think good breakfast stop  
I said we didn't do any research about this 
place again my apologies about the light it's  
just kind of look busy I mean there's tons of 
people in here so like that's the spot for us  
so it's good we'll kind of knock out breakfast 
and we'll continue uh exploring the neighborhood  
here but off to a good start wouldn't you say 
I think so nice all righty Manila is a pretty  
great City yeah there's all these different 
neighborhoods uh all throughout the town so  
it's organized pretty easily I really like this 
District in the sense that it's so historic I  
think yeah a lot of history really old building 
yeah it's pretty cool yeah and then street food  
everywhere and all these different neighborhoods 
I even Sue tons of street food and it's just  
everywhere and again you just like walk down 
any one street and you're gonna see local shops  
tons of street food right and just options 
clothing markets fruit vegetables there's a  
detailed fish back there on ice so it's like it's 
all good yeah and there's people out like there's  
like this street culture that there's people just 
hanging out together yeah and today's actually  
like some kind of holiday tie to uh what Kelly 
the the feast the black Nazarene yeah [Music]  
run ahead of that music real quick but even 
with a holiday like this you see all types  
of local people out um in terms of like we're 
hoping that things are open today too we're  
not sure though yeah well right now at least in 
these districts we'll be able to walk past the  
historic sites right so we'll keep going down the 
road I know there's some Churches I want to check  
out and kind of see those on the way but a cool 
neighborhood so one of the first historic iconic  
churches is the church of Saint Augustine and you 
can see pretty popular spot lots of Tourism here  
church is closed but you can walk right up to 
it so we're just now officially on the grounds  
and you can see it's a beautiful Church vendors 
and whatnot what do you think see you there nice  
church and guess what what's that if you're in 
Philippines you better look at some like rock like  
some of them on the streets yeah because I just 
found a penny so that is a quarter peso I believe  
pretty sweet right well four of those equals one 
peso so good on you sharp eyes but yeah here it is  
St Augustine beautiful at the Christmas tree what 
do you think Granite it looks pretty cool got in  
there right beautiful Church yeah nice huh yeah 
this is cool yeah I love it we'll have to read the  
plaque over there maybe yeah okay well you know 
that's on Wikipedia of course uh but beautiful  
and um the Philippines is perfect weather yes 
the weather is so nice it's warm but I'm not  
like overly sweaty a little breeze coming in but 
when we were like at that restaurant I was really  
hot ah but um I'm fine feeling better now all 
right let's touch the door the ancient door I  
think you're allowed to touch it oh yes welcome 
to Saint Augustine church wow it's beautiful  
yeah it is neat all right so that's kind of great 
what a what a good a good little stop [Music]  
21. 15 21. put it to the place nice yeah 
wow that's really old 15 16 17 18 19 20.  
so over 500 years is that right yeah jeez wow 
yeah that's awesome 450 years of art so there's  
the museum over there very cool where's the 
forest okay what do you see oh are you sneaking  
a peek through the crack oh yeah you can see it 
oh probably not the GoPro but it's the old it's  
like the straight up Cathedral on there nice all 
right moving on huh yeah that's good that's really  
cool piece of History just sitting right out here 
in the open I'm loving it and we'll go write down  
some of those uh historic roads I think okay 
look at that one also has a plaque over here  
yeah the museum 87. nice wow awesome yeah so just 
to verify uh on Cedar's story about finding money  
granted what did you just find boom so this 
is so together you two have have a peso nice  
where'd you find that one uh just on the floor 
all right on the ground the same one we're [Music]  
good well one peso is in terms of dollars but I 
don't know not very much but yeah it's special  
anyway you have half a peso so you don't have 
quite one peso yet all right so just down the  
street from one historical site there's another 
historical site yeah that's what it feels like  
we're here it's great there's also monuments 
all I mean almost every Park is filled not  
just with like one main Monument statues and 
and yeah memorials looking for uh and here's  
a memorial so certainly having to do with World 
War II 1945 yeah victims of the War uh basically  
uh name is an unknown uh common grave wow uh 
you know I think it's just a representation of  
that cedar so quite uh you know quite a shark uh 
Time Capsule department will open on February 18  
2045. okay wow okay so a little bit information 
so they're gonna open this in 2045. this is the  
Time Capsule hold on for us to take a 
little look around the back this guy's

uh February 18th 20 45. we should come back for 
that oh yeah how old will we be 45. uh we'll be  
60 ish five-ish Yeah Yeah in our 60s what maybe 
maybe Mark the date wow what do you think granite
it's pretty cool yeah something to see 
all right is this the Manila Cathedral  
okay second of the oldest all right 
what's the oldest this one this one  
uh Church of San Agustin okay the only one 
who survived Church during the World War Two  
wow amazing well preserved up next the Manila 
Cathedral beautiful I know I believe this is  
the second oldest cathedral kind of in this 
neighborhood gorgeous what'd you read Kyle  
um there was a lot of dates and names and I forgot 
all of them oh my goodness but there are some  
stained glass windows in there so awesome and the 
doors open and the doors open so maybe let's go it  
is okay let's switch it out yeah I'd love to see 
here well if you need money we'll just find out  
but it's uh it's looking historic it's looking 
beautiful they may uh not to be happy with the  
GoPro but let's uh we'll put it down we'll take a 
look if I can film it very well wow I can see all  
types of stained glass okay so we're in the church 
and there's actually Mass going on right now
oh man beautiful you can see 
all the same glass windows  
I love the high ceilings and the stained glass 
windows Cedar as we go closer is for Mass only  
uh she must mean Catholic yeah so we're 
not Catholic Books so we can't go up there  
but the talking about uh I think they're 
talking about the Holy Communion right now
yes drink drink the wine eat the bread 
for the blood and the body of Christ  
so that's what's going on right now 
you see all those beautiful colors
all right so the church service that we were 
just watching is now over and they opened up  
the doors and said we can walk right up so we are 
going to uh do that and now you can really see  
the nativity scene gorgeous Church Jesus on 
the cross is this not beautiful this is awesome  
so this church what almost 500 years old is I 
believe how it goes and again just huge Cathedral
oh there's the organ so the actual 
organ that they are playing a real organ  
okay well we're gonna hang out here for a few 
minutes to kind of answer the kids questions  
about church and religion and God and then we're 
going to step out and continue the day we have  
officially entered the fort Santiago kind of Park 
area now this is the first time we had to try to  
pay a uh fee to get in 250 pesos for the whole 
family so it's about five dollars yeah for all  
of us for all of us about a buck each um yeah and 
so we'll walk around again there's restaurants  
there's all types of like things in here but 
for us I just really want to see the forts yeah  
um so yeah you can see in this all old all 
historic there's art installations there's  
cannons yeah all the wall art if you will as 
uh all over the place so it's a pretty big Park  
um to check out but yeah you can 
certainly spend I imagine hours  
and hours in here definitely for me I'm kind 
of beelining it straight to the forge buddy
don't don't push the button for us whatever you do
you see through it blowing up the board boom he 
says that's about right outside forts Santiago
1571 I was reading it's just amazing to think 
about the buildings still being whoa hey kids  
wow still standing
yeah and right now they've turned it obviously 
into this like kind of this Plaza this park  
it's all like uh maintained and it looks 
great all of the uh flowers and trees  
gorgeous people are doing like kind 
of like exercise laps around I can see  
yeah that's great man what an awesome fort 
all right so this part of the fort is the most  
creepy this is the dungeon and we are reading 
signages that basically in like 1840 look at  
how low that is so in like 1845 they would just 
lock people in here and just never come back so  
people would just be by the hundreds locked in 
here and uh start just left to starve to death
so you get the idea I mean they have 
all this for the following rocks but  
ah the lights are playing havoc but 
yeah you get the idea man hundreds of  
people would just be locked away in here and 
left to start to death white dreidel history  
of the dungeons now they in terms of like how 
they've restored all this it's pretty cool  
um you know they've got obviously got the 
lights now they've got all these cages but  
then they have got like mannequins to give 
you at least a small idea of what it was like  
so I think that's that's kind of cool wow the 
dungeons so kind of coming to the forehead  
certainly walking through it it's self-guided 
there's no one uh even down here with us but
you can see just from rain like 
it's all murky and stuff so it's  
just like of hundreds of people 
being stuck down here no thanks
whoa okay so yeah when you come to the four 
definitely uh definitely take a tour uh in  
the dungeons you guys like the dungeon at 
least to see it they think about it yikes  
all right we're coming to the end of the 
video I mean first impressions are Manoa  
it's very it's even mellow and a lot of people 
a lot of things happening but like the calmness  
maybe it's because it's so holiday I don't know 
I don't know it's an awesome City now we've only  
just barely scratched the surface on where to 
explore yeah basically stick into the neighborhood  
here but there's so oh yeah he's he's at his end 
but there's so many neighborhoods so many places  
to check out I mean street food vendors basically 
at all of them the neighborhood section has its  
own street food Vibe yeah it's very cool I love 
that his the history all these like fours from  
the 1500s are so focusing that's really cool 
but we have one more one more thing one last  
thing to do one last thing for the video granted 
are you interested in a quail egg yeah yeah okay  
so we have uh this lady right here uh hello 
how are you okay so these are the quail eggs  
yeah okay and how much for one stick 25 25 for 
one stick okay we take one stick one state yeah
okay so into the cup I want to stick to eat 
them all right this is with the sweet sauce  
oh wow it's kind of swimming in it 
I like vinegar yeah we like vinegar
ah so the vinegar it's light on me 
okay all right it's finished thank  
you all right quail egg with 
sauce sweet sauce and vinegar
tastes really good yeah I'm gonna get on that 
super Saucy I mean she definitely hooked it up
mmm you know what sweet or chili 
we went with sweet you wanna travel
and there's a hard boiled egg inside it's a 
hard-boiled oil egg with a breading outside  
yeah breading on the outside what do you think of 
a cedar really good yeah I mean I kind of like I  
kind of want to try a spicy sauce you wanna 
try some spicy granite a little a little bit  
all right I made you so little
okay this is I think it's the 
same size with just a little chili
that's how you go yeah that's nice of the spicy 
sauce yeah actually do you want the last one  
no okay I'll go for it
so you just kind of stab it you can 
see it's in there with all those juices
pretty good little Street treat quail 
egg nice if I ate eggs I would join  
you in this well they're pretty 
good so a little tree like this  
25 pesos and you got stands like 
this I bet all over the city yeah  
yeah so first look into Manila our first kind of 
gay experience awesome Place Manila is so family  
friendly yes people everywhere have been like oh 
hello family and then kids are running up yeah  
yeah yeah and we're right kind of this Monument 
Park here many more monuments so nice but just  
so you don't think we uh keep abusing Kelly and uh 
her lack of options we are here with this the tofu
the tofu drink this is tofu with caramel 
and it looks delicious yeah I know I did  
signal one to him and we're getting 
two it looks like so that's okay okay
all right so the tofu and 
then oh it's like little beets
the boss and then this is the 
caramel oh and he stirs it [Music]  
was fun yeah this is like a 
brown sugar kind of caramel
stuff what gets here man nice extra extra 
sauce awesome all right oh and it's warm wow  
nice it's hot it's warm yeah okay uh how much 
surface the two 40 okay so 20 each yeah that  
looks great how is it taste so it's hot so I'm 
a little afraid to use a straw but it's got like
um the caramel and the little bubbles are not 
hot but the tofu is a little bit hot okay yeah  
that's terrible steaming I thought it was gonna 
be like the tofu drink we had in uh Jakarta which  
had like a ginger but this is definitely 
sweet and um actually reminds me more of  
a sugary drink like okay so it's different than 
that Jakarta tofu drink that's that kind of tea  
interesting yeah this is sweet um almost like 
molasses nice what'd you think of a granite it  
was really nice and sweet is it refreshing yes 
cool does it feel heavy or light light a little  
heavy-ish because it's got the tofu is probably 
light with all that caramelized sugar stuff yeah  
you're a fan of the bubble tea what do you 
think of this really good yeah you like it  
yeah I think that boba tea is better yeah this 
is just kind of a different type of thing let's  
try just the bubbles on the side the choke was a 
little hot to be to come eat coming up the straw  
but it's like a hearty warm drink right on 
and then warm and it's wintery so yeah it is  
it is not I wouldn't call it cold outside 
but any stretch but it is starting to get  
overcast so the temperatures have come 
down a little bit so this one's good
oh you got a little bubble there nice okay so 
with that all being said uh what a way to wrap  
it up uh man look at these guys got all these 
exercisers bicyclists people just out and about  
getting uh getting out and enjoying families kids 
everywhere yeah manila's a great City and we're  
just getting started everybody let's get started
