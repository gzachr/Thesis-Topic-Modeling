It's another really hot day in Manila.
Hi.
Hello.
Nadir.
-SM Mall of Asia?
SM Mall of Asia
Yes.
I think it's like 36 degrees today.
And today I'm going to the 
largest mall in Asia.
All right.
I think this is it.
This is the Mall of Asia,
which is one of the largest malls
in the whole world.
I think it's like the fifth biggest
and it's the largest in the Philippines.
And it's got like,
I'll just show you
The overall shopping area of the space is like 
5 million square foot,
500,000 square meters.
I can't even visualize how big that is.
I was like looking at the...
the outline of this place on Google Maps, and it goes like 
half a kilometer from one end to the other.
There's so many floors
and so many entrances.
So it's literally impossible for anyone to, you know, 
cover all of that
in one day and I'd say it's like 
covering the louvre in Paris
in one day.
But I'm just going to try to get the stuff that I really need 
and show you guys as much as I see myself.
We've got a lot of stuff here.
I saw Shake Shack when I came in,
so I think I'll just first get a chocolate milkshake
because I haven't really had a proper breakfast yet.
Hi.
Can I get a chocolate classic shake?
-Ok. Anything else?
No, that's it for now.
-May I ask your name, sir?
My name? Nadir. 
N A D I R.
And I have like a little bit of a tummy ache,
cause I think I've been eating too much crazy stuff, and now 
I just get a chocolate shake the first time I see it.
So if you haven't been to a Shake Shack before,
they give you like these things 
that like start ringing when your order is ready
so you can just go and get it.
Makes things very convenient than like 
standing and waiting in line and,
checking if it’s ready the whole time.
Okay. I think it’s going off. 
That was fast.
-Shake, sir. Thank you.
Salamat Po.
Man, that was instantaneous.
Yes.
Love it.
Thankfully, Shake Shack tastes the same 
pretty much everywhere you go.
First time I had one in New York,
I think 10 years ago or 12 years ago.
My first trip to New York.
My cousin took me there.
And the line was ridiculous.
He was like, “It’s gonna be worth it”
And it was worth it.
Ok, this is interesting.
I have no idea where this is going.
but it's getting hotter for sure.
Probably just going outside.
So, I'm going to the next building
because that's where 
my SIM card provider is.
They have a store
I need to top up my balance.
And the online option isn’t working.
-Yes, Po. How may I help you?
Hello.
Looking for Globe.
-Globe? There.
Globe Telecom
Is it over there? Ok.
Thank you.
So they have this like area of the market 
called cyber zone,
where you see everything from like 
Dell to Oppo.
Verizon. I didn’t even know Verizon is here.
I'm looking for Globe
because I have their SIM card
and I need to Top up. For some reason, I can't
like use it at all even though I have data.
This is it.
So, apparently I had like data that ran out
within seven days. No one told me that 
when I was getting the plan.
But I just got more data, like 25 gigs,
which is only valid for 15 days, which sucks.
Which means I have to 
do this all over again
on April 4th or something like that.
That was 800 pesos, which is like $14
for 15 days and like 30 days of calling.
At this point, this is not a lot cheaper than just getting
an esim, which I can get from home
without having to come to a mall.
Maybe I'm doing something wrong.
Oh, Samsung.
Thank you for giving me
all the free stuff
and phones and everything else
that you gave me.
Ok, now we're going back to the mall.
Now I'm going to try to find some clothes
that I need desperately.
Like I don't go shopping for clothes that often.
Once every couple of years
when I buy a pair of jeans.
But I really need to get some stuff 
because my stuff has holes in it
and it's all worn out and everything.
There are these cool kiosks you can use to find
whatever store you're looking for.
Hopefully I can find my H&M here.
That should help me out
or set me off in the right direction, at least.
Alright. I see the promised Land.
This is the kids section though.
Ok, I’ve got like four t shirts
I want to try out
Like this too.
-You have 30 days return or an exchange policy
Ok.
-as long as you don’t take off the price tag
One of them...
I think it was a small,
but I couldn't find the...
No, this is extra small.
-We have all sizes on the display.
I just remembered I need 
a backup pair of swim shorts
since I'll be swimming a lot in the Philippines,
hopefully in the next two months.
Okay. So, three t shirts, swim trunks together
everything combined cost me like $35,
which is not too bad.
I do need to get some jeans.
So, this might be the place to get it.
-And the length is only 30.
And this is 30?
-Yeah.
The waist- is there are 29?
This one's definitely like...
too loose
Trying to find something 
that's the right size. It's so important.
Okay. They only had one,
which was the right size. 29x30.
Man, I am loving this pair of jeans.
We’ve got a pair of jeans
and two pairs of underwear.
and I think I need more underwear. 
So, I am going to go out and...
look a bit more.
Just got more underwear
for like 60 bucks
for two pairs of underwear.
They don’t have boxer briefs.
So I just got some tight trunks.
When you need underwear,
you need underwear.
You don't really get to
pick and choose too much, I guess.
So was looking at some snorkel masks,
in this store, Chris Sports.
and they're like $30, which isn't the worst.
So you all have to like 
rent out snorkels in different places
if you don't have a snorkel mask.
But the problem is if you have one, 
you’ve to carry it everywhere.
And like my bags have literally no space.
So maybe I'll just have to pay more 
and rent one out, when I need to use one.
Under Armour
And the guy basically who saved the brand 
of Under Armor and made it relevant.
Let's see if they have some athletic wear
that I would like to get
before I go off to the islands. 
So they got these hiking shoes, which
I don't know about these specific ones,
but they're called Ridge Trail.
So I'm guessing they are hiking shoes.
I can't like vouch for these,
but I've had like these Under armor shoes
for like two and a half years
since I moved to Hawaii.
And they're doing really solid, like
well actually three years.
I've had these for three years.
They are still pretty solid hiking shoes.
So I know these are like not cheap usually.
I think they're probably like $150
or something like that. Yeah, 8500 pesos.
160 bucks.
But...
it is worth it
if you want a hiking shoe that lasts.
That is not why I'm here.
Looking for some sleeveless stuff that’s this material,
So you know, I need quick dry stuff.
because I sweat so much.
If it doesn't dry fast enough, it’ll get smelly as hell.
Let's see if I can find this in Decathlon
So there’s a self check out option here
which is pretty cool.
So when you're trying to find some athletic shirts 
and ended up buying even more underwear.
This is the underwear I'll probably be wearing a lot because,
you know, it's athletic stuff
and I end up moving a lot with heavy backpacks,
which I think is an athletic feat.
But yeah, I'm going to try to find some sleeveless
athletic wear
in Nike and Adidas.
There's something called the Brow Lounge 
That's the menu.
If I need to get my eyebrows waxed,
I guess this is where I should be going.
-Where are you from?
Bangladesh. 
-Wow.
Yeah.
-Have you been here for how many days already?
Like one already. 
-One week?
Yeah.
-Haven’t you been to the islands here?
No, not yet. I'm just in Manila. Now
I'm going to go, like, in two or three days to other places. 
I'll be here two months.
So, yeah...
-Are you vlogger?
Yeah.
We are at the Nike, Adidas.
Please help me find some
sleeveless shirts because I've been looking for this
for like the last two countries.
This place?
Oh, man, this is thick.
This is not quick dry.
I feel like, guys have stopped wearing sleeveless shirts.
You know, I don't like necessarily like the look.
It's just so much more practical
when you sweat as much as I do.
It's the closest thing that's like acceptable to being shirtless,
which is ideally what I would be given how much I sweat.
Do you have a quick dry material?
So it's just this? Okay. Alright.
Thank you.
Okay Nike, don’t let me down.
Unfortunately, there wasn't much here
that was sleeveless and good
or good looking, in my opinion.
So I think I'm just gonna have to go to 
Divisoria again and buy some more fake shit.
I see a DJI store,
so I'm going to have to check it out.
These are the FPV drones
which I don't know how to fly.
So an FPV combo for this is 51,000,
which is like less than $1,000.
But I've heard good things.
Looking at the gimbals here,
This is the RS 3 Mini
which only weights 1.75 kgs.
Which is like less than I assume
Weebill S, which I don't have anymore
cause I couldn’t find it,
and I broke the last one.
So I am honestly debating 
if I should get one of these.
Maybe I'll get it later.
You know there’s stuff in there
that looked exciting,
but I never..
I'm never going to buy electronics
without watching like 10 hours of reviews
and comparisons on YouTube
about a particular device.
Cause that's a big commitment you're making.
You're buying something to film.
If it doesn't work out,
you just have to throw it away.
It's very hard to like resell it
when you're on the road, you know?
So there’s a movie theater
in the middle of the mall.
None of these are movies I want to watch.
That one I would, but...
I don't think it's out yet.
There’s something here called Slime World
and the concept is very interesting.
I think you get like gooey stuff all over you.
But the more I look into it,
it seems like more for kids.
Definitely not for like a dude.
by himself.
Yeah, they play games and stuff over there.
This is one of the highlights of this mall.
There's like an ice skating rink
all the way in there.
And you can basically go in
and skate around in that thing.
And I'm not sure if I should do this.
I've never ice skated in my life before.
Thinking about it.
It could be hard to go around and film
if I’ve never ice-skated.
Let me ask.
Well, it closes at 7:15 p.m.
so that made my decision a lot easier.
But if you want to come here, 
you can skate here for like 2 hours,
for five bucks or something like that.
Oh, look at this.
People practicing archery too.
So, there's like a archery station
and ice skating, all kinds of athletics.
So this is definitely more than just a mall.
This is an interesting name.
Fine Middle Eastern Eats.
Shwarma.
300.
No, 300 is a lot for a meal in the Philippines
because I have gotten stuff
for like a lot less than that.
Hi, how are you?
Yeah, looking at it.
How much is this one?
-You want to try?
Yeah.
Do you have it outside?
-Yeah.
-Are you a vlogger?
Yeah.
-Wow.
Do you have something with, like,
thicker frames than this?
But, like, the same style.
-Same style?
But, like, something thicker.
-How about this?
Because I end up breaking stuff.
If it’s too thin, I always like bend it.
It looks good, though.
-Do you like it?
I do but the frame is a little...
I know I'm going to like, bend it at some point.
You know, it’s like too skinny like that.
But yeah, it's a good look.
-Sunglasses of Gucci.
-Well this one will suit you.
Man, I am so proud of myself
for not spending 180 bucks on those sunglasses.
Because I really, really liked them.
But at the same time,
they had like, these really skinny handles.
And every time I got sunglasses 
with the skinny frames,
I end up, like, bending it
or breaking it in six months.
So that would have probably been a waste. So...
kudos to me for not buying that.
Back in the electronics section.
I'm trying to find like a
stick for my GoPro.
So, I can go like underwater
scuba diving and stuff like that
because I learned the hard way in Maldives 
like this short stick
doesn't work, that well.
It doesn't give you a good enough view
when you're underwater.
Do you have a GoPro stick like a long one?
-Please go with him.
Over there?
How much is this one?
-This one is only 1590.
1590.
But this isn’t like floating, right?
-Yes.
-You can also use them like this.
-You can also use for the monopod.
-You’ll get a good range with it.
Ok.
Ok, I'm getting a long floaty stick
that extends because you know, this is too short.
So you're sure this will float, right?
-Yes.
Okay. 
-This one is a Float Extension.
Oh, Float Extension.
Salamat Po.
Thank you.
I think that is the last thing
I'm buying here today,
which is perfect because...
there isn't any more space in my bag and there's definitely 
some stuff I'm going to have to throw away
just from my main backpack.
You know I'm starting to regret bringing that like 
heavy lens, the Canon one.. or the Sigma* one,
that's like one kilogram and I'm probably 
never going to use it on this trip.
Now I’m going to try to find some food.
Man, the security here is so weird.
They make me like
take off my bag and open it
and then they don't even look at it.
They like pretend to look at it
Like some sort of formality.
Pretty sure that no one's 
actually checking what's in the bag
because no one has time to do that.
There's like 200,000 people
that come to this mall everyday, so
there's no way they can check every one.
There's like this thing
in the middle of the mall.
And I hope no kids actually get on top of here
because, you know, if they fall,
they would die. There's no railing.
Okay, there's some on the bottom floor.
And maybe that's more accessible
because there's stairs and stuff.
So now after thinking about the millions of 
fine dining options that I have in this mall,
I've decided I'm going to eat some McDonald's.
I actually haven't eaten any McDonald's
since last year, like 2022. 
I think last time I was in Serbia.
If I remember right on the way to the airport,
when my friend was dropping me off.
Not recommending eating McDonald's.
It's not healthy at all.
It’s good to remember where you came from.
which in my case, 
I came from eating a lot of McDonald's.
And I'm craving for it right now.
Can I have a spicy chicken sandwich with fries.
-Mac?
-Mcspicy?
Mcspicy..
-Sorry, sir. Not available.
-We only have a McChicken
- (Foreign language)
I’ll get a Crispy chicken sandwich
Can I get that?
-That's number four, sir?
Number four. Yeah, I'll get...
Medium fries with that.
-Are you vlogger?
Yeah. 
-Oh, wow.
Yeah.
-Thank you, sir.
Alright, guys. I got my burger, 
I got my fries, got my sprite.
This is not healthy,
But I think I've walked like...
15,000 steps today.
Like, 10 kilometers
just inside this mall.
I didn't go anywhere else the whole day,
so I think that's, like, enough to
earn a burger hopefully.
That's going to be it for today's vlog.
And this is like a very unusual vlog
from what I usually make.
You know, most of you watch my channel.
You know I do like historical stuff
and I do
nature stuff with hiking and drone shots.
This is none of that.
So basically I've been doing these 
market hunt vlogs at these local markets
that I recently found are just very popular
because I guess people are just curious 
to see how like shopping
in some local way in a different country.
But this was just visiting a big mall. So...
I think this is going to be
if I upload it, this is going to be like
not one of my favorite
YouTube videos ever.
If I upload this,
this means that everything else
I've made from the Philippines is doing really well,
so might as well upload this.
I wish I could have gotten to that
ice skating thing, you know,
because that would have made it
so much more exciting.
I wanted to try ice skating.
I knew about that,
but that was closed, too.
So I guess this is just about me shopping
for, like T-shirts and jeans
and underwear. Lots of underwear.
Alright.
That's it for this one.
If you like this video like it.
You want to see more videos like this,
let me know.
If you want to watch more videos,

That's where I post these things
way before YouTube and Facebook.
I'll catch you guys in the next video from...
 I think I'm making another video from Manila,
and then I'm going somewhere else in the Philippines.
