welcome back in this morning showbiz
report the new filipino romantic comedy
love or money starring two of the
biggest stars in the philippines is now
available on i want tfc
but is it worth your love or money
here's my answer
[Music]
it's an age-old question we've seen
explored before
which is better love or money in this
new star cinema film the answer comes
with a romantic comedy twist
angelica is angel an ambitious woman who
will do anything to survive
and coco martin is lyon a struggling
overseas filipino worker
and a ferocious believer of the power of
love
dubai plays a major part in the film
leon works in the sparkling city as a
bartender and the angel is finding her
dreams
slowly fading away a chance encounter
reignites their passion
and then drama happens
from director may cruz lvr the film
works because of the palpable chemistry
between the leagues
this is their first film together but
angelica's great comedic timing and
coco's down to earth charm
feel like they've been working as a team
for a long time
and the comedy works here as well
because it's grounded in reality we see
the dark side of being an overseas
worker and the sad truth about falling
in love at the wrong time
the film makes you laugh while asking
the question
is having money really worth it
is set up nicely and then it changes
tone in the last act of the film but
don't worry it has a good payoff that
will make you laugh
cry and fall in love and in the end
and for that love our money gets three
and a half out of four
love is all we need kisses
so download the app i want tfc and enjoy
love our money right now and so manny
um where did they actually do the
filming because a part of it looked like
dubai
it was it was principally shot in dubai
okay beautiful i want to go there this
movie makes me want to go there joe you
were right and the move
the music in that
