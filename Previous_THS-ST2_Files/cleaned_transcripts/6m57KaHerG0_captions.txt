what's going on everybody this is Island Hopper 
TV coming to you from the Philippines today we're  
going to talk about the best places to go 
while visiting here let's do it that's right  
everybody I've been to many different islands and 
provinces across the Philippines and I've went to  
some places that I absolutely loved and then I 
went to some places that I didn't exactly love  
and I'm going to help you make your travel plans 
to the Philippines makes sense with this list of  
10 places for you to consider visiting I'll also 
give you my list of the best ones to put at the  
top in my opinion and there will be time stamps 
Below in the description first up is Siargao now  
Siargao is known as the surfing capital of the 
Philippines due to the famous Cloud9 which is a  
powerful Reef break that breaks off the west coast 
of the island into the Pacific Ocean but surfing  
is not the only thing that you can find here 
as well as many different lagoons in 2019 this  
island was actually rated as the best island 
in the world by Conde Nast I recently stayed here  
for 5 days and I hung out around General Luna 
which is the main town just south of Cloud9 we  
did make a full travel guide about this island and 
its surrounding areas do be sure to check that out  
I'll put a link below in the description but you 
can see right here they have Daku Island Virgin  
Island naked island and also Guyam Island which 
is probably the most famous you can easily do  
island hopping of three islands in half a day from 
General Luna the main town by the way General Luna  
is about 45 minutes away from Del Carmen where 
the airport is there's also another Lagoon which  
is one of the best lagoons I've ever been to in 
the world and that's on the southwestern side of  
the island called Sugba Lagoon so definitely don't 
miss that one and next up is going to be El Nido also  
known as the little bird's nest this here is on 
the Northern part of Palawan Island. Palawan is one  
of the most majestic islands in the Philippines 
and even in the world and El Nido is its crown jewels  
sitting there at the top with many different 
islands that you can go around and there are  
big lagoons little lagoons secret lagoons hidden 
beaches super amazing place the best time of year  
to visit here is going to be around April but 
if you can't get here in April try to show up  
from January until May because during those other 
months is rainy season I actually showed up here  
in September and it was rainy two of the four days 
that I was here doing island hopping the best way  
to get here is to arrive in Porto Princesa and 
then hang out check out the underwater river over  
there and check out the Subterranean River over 
there that's a UNESCO world heritage site and then  
drive 4 to 5 hours in a van or boss up into El Nido 
and then you can depart out of here to Coron or  
Manila from the El Nido airport the best place to 
stay while here is going to be El Nido beach now  
we're going to go to Coron which is a 4 to 5
hour ferry ride from el nido they also have an  
airport here at Busuanga so the main island that 
you're going to arrive in no matter what is called  
Busuanga off the shore is going to be Coron Island 
you will find  Coron town but that's on Busuanga  
island so keep that in mind when booking your 
travel accommodation the main areas to check out  
while here are going to be Kagayan Lake where you 
can get the scenic Viewpoint looking down towards  
the Lagoon and then go diving in that freshwater 
and saltwater Lagoon up there on the mountain then  
you head over to Barracuda Lake and then twin 
lagoons those three are the most impressive and  
most popular but I actually enjoyed Sunset Lagoon 
and the diving around the coral garden and coral  
Reef really a magical place here I would recommend 
spending about 3 days exploring around the area  
of Busuanga and Coron before going on to your next 
destination like El Nido or Boracay something around  
there now when you book your accommodation try 
to stay in Coron Town or as close to there as  
possible we did make full travel guides of both 
El Nido and Coron I will put those links in the  
description as well now here we are at Boracay
which was also rated by another publication as the  
best island in the world this small island north 
of Aklan is one of the most popular destinations in  
all of Philippines although I rank it number 
four on this list they have the most tourist  
infrastructure but they also have the most crowds 
on this beautiful white Beach there's several  
areas you can go around here and explore including 
Puka Beach which is a Shell Beach as well as the  
main Beach here if you're looking for party and 
excitement you're going to be able to find that  
here by night and and then in the daytime you 
can find beach activities diving all that stuff  
also but if you're not the type of person looking 
to do rock and roll bar hopping all that you can  
probably skip Boracay because it is quite intense 
there's many other islands that offer a beach Vibe  
and now we're headed down to and now we're headed 
down to the heart of central Visayas this here is  
seu here you have many different areas to explore 
primarily divided by North Cebu and South Cebu so  
in the north you're going to have Bantayan island 
Malapascua island and Camotes Island as well as the  
Cebu Safari and Adventure Park so better beaches 
and more islands off the coast of Cebu in the north  
then if you go south you have places like Oslob
you also have a beautiful island down there called  
Sumilon Island and you have whale shark watching my 
favorite thing to do on Cebu is waterfall chasing  
so I like to see all the different waterfalls because
there are many and do some Canyoneering most of  
the canyon Ravines to do that are going to be on 
the west side of the island by Moalboal and that's  
actually a great place to go as well because they 
have the sardines run over there so if you get a  
chance head over to mall ball that's a tough one 
to say I know but hey that's a good place to go  
there's two ways to arrive into Cebu it's usually 
going to be by airplane into Cebu City which is on  
mton island is where the airport is nearby Lapu 
Lau you can also arrive by ferry into  Cebu next  
up we're looking at Bohol now Bohol is basically 
one big island which is known as the island of  
Boho and then to the South is Panglao there's 75 
total islands around bold to explore some of the  
main attractions include the lobok river which is 
a really nice river cruise with a dinner buffet  
or a lunch buffet also going out to the Chocolate 
Hills and then checking out the man-made Forest  
when you're in the South down by Panglao you 
can check out caves go around to the beaches  
like Alona Beach Beach or dumaluan they also 
have some cliff jumping and then it's a divers  
Paradise going out island hopping to places like 
balag Island riding ATVs is popular also going to  
check out the tarsier this is the world's smallest 
primate or at least one of them and it's Unique to  
Bohol I was visiting during rainy season so when 
I went up to the Chocolate Hills to get a view as  
you can see it was more like the Green Hills not 
exactly chocolate but hey still amazing views of  
these unique looking Hills that just kind of roll 
across the countryside next up we're headed to  
Siquijor which is known as the magical Arts Island 
for those of you who want to look more into that  
you can take a look but they say it's an enchanted 
island I did a full Island Tour I rented a car  
went around the whole island in one day I would 
recommend two days here uh the only way that I  
know to arrive is going to be by ferry they have 
two different ports so uh if you're looking to get  
out here you're either going to come come from 
Negros Island and Dumaguete or from Bohol some of  
the best activities include going to Paliton Beach 
also checking out the old tree called the Balete 
tree this is a really cool place to go they have 
fish that are really big eating at your dead skin  
on the feet and then they also have waterfalls 
here so lots to do on sikor really a magical  
place the main municipalities that you want to 
look at are going to be the town called Siquijor  
then there's also San Juan which is probably the 
most laid-back chill with the hipsters and then  
you have Lorena all of which are along the beach 
and worth checking out as with many islands in the  
Philippines there's a Spanish history with these 
missions and churches this one here is in Lazi you  
may want to check that out now here we are over on 
the main island of louson this here is Manila also  
known as Metro Manila which includes Quezon city 
as well as BGC, Makati and many other areas the  
population here is over 13 million people it's 
the sixth densely populated city in the world  
so it's quite busy here and traffic is atrocious 
but there's a lot of benefits to hanging out in  
Manila and it is the main Hub when you arrive into 
Philippines you're either going to arrive into seu  
City or Manila but there's things you can see 
and do around here like going to Intramuros and  
walking along the seaside the Waterfront hanging 
out in BGC and maati so do take some time maybe 24  
to 48 hours to explore Manila some of the largest 
malls in all of Asia are here including SM Mall  
of Asia and you just saw the Venice canals mall 
that's a small one but still many different big  
malls and I really enjoyed hanging out at the 
seaside eating some food the food down here is  
going to include things like sisig or lechon 
you're also Going to find some Lumpia Shanghai and  
Pon sit so Manila is a great place to try Filipino 
food also while on Luzon you can head up to Baguio  
or Vigan which is in the northern part there's 
also Batanes and then you have Tal volcano which  
is actually an active volcano in the middle of the 
lake sometimes when you're in Philippines you'll  
hear their Smog or fog as they call it uh which 
is volcanic Smog and that's from tall volcano  
now from the North in Luzon we're headed to the 
southernmost island of Mindanao this here is Davao  
City we highlight the city but really the area 
around Mindanao here you're going to have places  
like Mount Apo this here is the tallest volcano 
or mountain in all of the Philippines some people  
like to hike up there if you're really looking 
for a challenge but I just hung out around the  
coffee country and found it to be quite nice 
they also have hot springs up here then they  
have Samal Island known as The Garden Paradise 
that's really close to Davao City you can get a  
little Villa right there on the beach here really 
beautiful island oh my gosh and yeah the western  
part of Mindanao is actually off limits there is 
a travel advisory so I wouldn't go that far west  
but if you go to the north you're going to have 
seral deler and seral Norte and that's actually  
different than the island that's attached to 
mind now Daval city is actually the second  
largest metro area in the Philippines even larger 
than seu City so it is worth getting down here to  
men now to check it out now we're going to head up 
to Pampanga this is actually where Angeles city is I  
considered Angeles city or the area around Clark 
the old Air Force Base to be the nicest part of  
all of the Philippines the most modern uh they 
have a lot of infrastructure here because of the  
US military that was set up and it's also just 
a very nice atmosphere and environment because  
it's so Lush and beautiful right here not as many 
palm trees but lots of native vegetation now there  
is a big mountain here called Mount Pinatubo and 
it did erupt back in the early 90s so keep that  
in mind when you're visiting here but now let's 
talk about the Philippines in general or Luzon
a little bit more we talked about Vigan we talked 
about baguio and the rice patties up there there's  
also the Thousand Islands area and then you have 
the far north so definitely do some more exploring  
around Luzan alapo one more thing I want to say 
about the Philippines it's really divided into  
three areas in the north you have Luzon in the 
center you have the islands of Visaya and then in the  
South you have Mindano and their Islands so that's 
how the Philippines is set up and you'll hear it  
commonly addressed that way there's many different 
languages here including a whole another language  
aside from tagalog called Visayas and on that note 
that's going to conclude this episode of Island
