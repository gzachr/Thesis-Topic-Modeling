so we're going to make this filipino designer 
cake in three steps designer cake because we're  
going to make a nice design and filipino because 
we're going to add leche flan we'll start with the  
frosting so we have some room temperature butter 
here 25 grams we'll be mixing this butter first
we'll be adding 100 grams of cream cheese
room temperature
so we will not be adding any sugar to this okay 
because we don't want the cake to be too sweet  
so it's just uh 25 grams of butter 
and 100 grams of cream cheese  
and we're gonna put this in the 
fridge for about half an hour
step number two is the leche flan 
i'll be starting with four egg yolks
and four and we'll be uh whisking 
in some sweetened condensed milk  
i'm gonna go for about one third of a can
so we'll be not making a lot so 
this is the the mold for the cake  
so i've been putting some butter here 
just to prevent the cake from sticking
so next i'll be melting some sugar 50 grams so 
the sugar starts to melt when it's a caramel i  
quickly add it to the mold and then we'll add the 
leche flat mixture okay at the end of this video  
there will be a challenge for you because i would 
like you to try also making this cake okay and  
today is the first time for me to make it it's my 
um my own idea so let's hope it will turn out well  
caramel mixture is ready almost ready so 
i've been adjusting this recipe a little bit  
adding a little bit more sugar so please add 
more than 50 grams guys just to cover the bottom  
and then we'll add the leche flan mixture on top
boiling water just a little layer
leche flan we'll be covering this and 
we'll be steaming it at 180 degrees celsius
for one hour okay well the leche flan is in the  
oven we're gonna make the cake mix so we 
have 100 grams of butter softened butter
we'll mix it first
then we will add two whole eggs
and finally 200 grams of cake mix
finally i'll be mixing this on a high setting
i took the leche flan out a little bit sooner  
so i did it after 45 minutes because it's 
already firm so we'll be adding this cake mix
and this cake mix will again go in the oven at 160 
degrees celsius for one hour so i took the cake  
out of the oven i let it rest for about 30 
minutes so it's uh cooled off a little bit  
now the interesting moment so we use 
this sharp knife just to cut the edges  
so that it will be easier to 
come out Pogi's relaxing there
Pogi!
whoa you can see the leche 
flan on top with the caramel  
looks delicious now we're going 
to add the frosting on the side  
that we made earlier this uh this just came out 
of the fridge so i hope it's gonna stick well
to give this cake a nice look 
we're gonna add sprinkles  
on the side i carefully press on the 
side push these sprinkles a little bit
and i'm going to put this in the fridge for 
a little while and then we're ready to cut it  
and taste of course it has uh it has been in the 
fridge for about 30 minutes so let's cut a slice
look at that there's a leche 
flan cake frosting and sprinkles
nice not too matamis because 
of the frosting and the  
cake is like semi-sweet but a nice 
combination with the letterflan  
texture is also very nice please give it a try 
yourself okay and let me know how it goes you  
can use the pinoy planet hashtag in your video
