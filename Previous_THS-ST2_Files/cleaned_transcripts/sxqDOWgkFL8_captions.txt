Hi, people!
So, today is going to be a sit down-and-talk video
I will be...
I will be... doing an information vomit
So as you can see from the title, I will be
I will be relaying my experience 
in applying to a Korean university
specifically for Korea 
University and Yonsei University
BY THE WAY, since "Korea University" 
and "Yonsei University" are like
mouthfuls to say, I will just be 
saying 고려대 and 연세대 respectively
A lot of people ask me specific stuff both on
Youtube comments and on my Instagram DMs
and some people requested I make 
a video on it [applying] as well
So, I've decided to just
answer the call of the people
If you haven't watched my reaction video yet,
I'm gonna link it up here or here
but if I fail to do it that means I did not
discover how to actually link a video on either 
one of these corners (i wasn't able to <///3)
The thing about my application is
that it refers to a very 
small demographic of people,
because the application 
process that I went through
refers only to Koreans who...
studied abroad
who basically undertook all 
of their education abroad
And that's like a really, really small population
BUT!
For the documents,
I looked at the application guide 
for international students as well
and it's basically the same
But mine is a little bit more complex
I had to submit like some other additional stuff
I will not make any claims about the
application process for 
international students because
I might get something wrong, since 
I didn't go through it myself,
and we don't want that 🤧
So, my role here is just to give you an idea
of what I submitted personally and...
how those documents... made me... pass 🥵
Keep in mind that what I did is specifically 
for the Spring 2021 admissions for me
I don't know if it's going to change 
for the Fall 2021 or Spring 2022
So for my general notes...
When it comes to the English-taught majors
I noticed that a lot of people asked if
you can go to university in 
Korea without learning Korean
First of all,
there's something very wrong 
with that thought process
because if you're going to university in Korea,
you SHOULD learn the language
But I do understand the question of
if you have to learn Korean prior to 
taking university courses in Korea
Yes and no...?
It depends on the major that you choose
E v e r y o n e who is
researching about undergraduate in Korea...
You have probably heard of the 
Underwood International College for 연세대
Most people look towards 연세대 because
Yonsei has a really good 
system of promoting themselves
as an international college
'cause they have a separate 
college that is all in English
Underwood International 
College hosts a lot of majors
and that's a good point for a 
lot of International Students
But there is a common misconception
Okay, no it's not really-
I can't say it's a common misconception but
just from my observation, not a 
lot of people actually look towards
Korea University
Korea University does offer English majors!
So basically in 고려대...
There are two colleges that offer majors-
like you can graduate taking all English courses
So one is the Division of International Studies
and the other is the Korea University Business 
School, College of Business Administration
So if your interests align with international 
studies and/or business administration
I do encourage you to check 
out Korea University as well :D
Now, we're moving on the 
Korea University [application]
First, I just want to say
that there is an application guide 
available online on the KU homepage
and it's a very, very detailed application guide
they literally say everything you have to do so
make sure to check that out!
(why is my voice like this)
To go to the Korea University website,
type that oku.korea.ac.kr and go the Seoul campus
and on the first tab you'll 
see the categories of students
I was under this one, the 전교육과정해외이수자
so once you click that you'll be 
presented with the application guide
so for you overseas Koreans out 
there who have studied abroad
all their life, this one's for you ;;;)
and going back, let's go to 
the International Students tab
and you'll be redirected to this page
just click that red button there
and click the degree program 
for International Students
and you'll find the application 
guide in English there
Okay, so that's how you go to the homepage so
look for that application guide and just read it!!
Now, if you're a really lazy person and of course
I want you to continue watching this video
I will be showing you a screenshot 
of the documents overview
of the international students 
right here (you can pause)
and then the documents overview 
for the overseas Koreans right here
Now, for the moment you guys 
have all been waiting for
(maybe)
My grades and the actual 
documents that I submitted
So because I applied as a 12-year overseas Korean
I had to submit all of my grades 
from 1st grade to 12th grade
So, I had to go to all the schools 
I'd attended during that time period
to request for my transcripts
was not fun
so if you're an overseas Korean...
I'm so sorry for you
But if you're an international student,
or like a 3-year overseas Korean I think
or something like that; a different category
you just have to submit your secondary 
or your high school grades so
that's convenient
Now, I will be showing you all 
of the grades that I submitted
Okay so first here are my 
grade school grades, I was
THRIVING
in grade school
Wow, I mean...
what did I even do
And here are my junior high school grades
so this is from 7th to 10th grade
uuuuuuhhhh, kind of went down
bkfjhsfkjhsdkf
anyway
I'm gonna say something about that later
And then these are my senior high school grades
this is 11th and 12th grade
So I put grade school, junior high 
school, and senior high school
because that's the system 
we have in the Philippines
Now, for my comments about this
For my 1st to 6th grade,
I was in a very small school so
that's why I was able to get
like a pretty good
you know
record of grades
So I think that the institution 
name matters [not necessarily a lot]
because even though my grades relatively dropped
during 7th to 10th grade
I was in a science high school at that time and
you know science high schools! They're...
known. haha
Anyway
So I think the school reputation also matters,
not just the grades
Because there's also a section where 
you can submit your school profile
which basically states the 
acceptance rate of your school,
the number of students in your school...
Basically, the technical, 
objective reputation of your school
So they take that into consideration as well
So I did not show my grades to brag guys
even if it's like, nothing to brag about really
I just showed you guys like, 
I wanted to be open about it
so you guys know the kind of grades that I had
to get accepted
But I do firmly, firmly, firmly believe that
the grades are not a super big 
advantage on your application
like there are so many more [factors]
So I will be talking about my 
extracurricular activities now
for KU, I was given a list/table with 10 slots
so I had a maximum of 10 extracurricular 
activities which I could submit
and they asked for official certificates
or certified true copies
or any PROOF
so you have to have a 
person-in-charge, like their name
and their contact number
I'm not sure for the international 
students but that was my application
I didn't fill up all of the 10 
slots because I'm not a very...
involved person ahah
I will be listing down the 
most prominent ones that I put
so you guys have an idea of what activities I did
Okay, so first is the Vaugirard scholarship
so it's an academic scholarship
given to like the top 50 public school takers
of like, an entrance exam for senior high school
Second one is the Director's List scholarship
so this is also an academic scholarship
awarded to the top...
80??
either 80 or 200
I'm not really sure
I don't know why there's a 
huge gap between my guesses
like 80 and 200
but I think it's one of those
If not then, my mistake
Those two scholarships I think 
strengthened my application pretty well
Yeah but I don't know how I 
got those scholarships either
don't ask me I'm not super smart
Next, I also submitted random 
certificates for research
because KU is also known as a research university
Like, they have a high research output
so I thought that research-related stuff
would be good to submit
Next is the IELTS
So, it's either 1. you take an 
English proficiency test like I did
so I took the IELTS you can also get the TOEFL
or 2. you could request 
proof from your school that
undertook your courses majorly in English
But the problem is, I thought that 
I wasn't able to request for that
because I came from a public science high school
from 7th to 10th grade and
we didn't necessarily have our classes in English
So I was just like, oh my god nevermind
I'm just going to take the test
and I took the test,
without reviewing for it
because I'm...
✨confident✨
Anyway, I took the IELTS,
got an 8,
amazing
So, oh, this is a big thing
this next one
So I went on a student exchange 
program to Japan before my
last year of high school
so since I applied to an international college
I think it's a good indicator 
that I am not afraid to
go to a foreign country
even though Korea's not really foreign to me
but go to a different country, like
a whole other country
and I'm going to be able to adapt 
independently and well in that country
because I have already 
experienced kind of studying
in a foreign country
Next, the ACT
I was really skeptical if I was 
going to submit this or not because
I took the ACT with like, five days of review
like CRAM REVIEW 😭
I'm not very, very proud of my score
I couldn't retake the ACT 
cause it was so damn expensive
It was like, 10K pesos
So like, when I got my results I was like
oh my god I'm stuck with this 😔
So anyway, I got a 31
not my proudest moment but...
Yeah, I think those are the most prominent ones
I hope you guys got a pretty good idea of
what kind of person I am-
what kind of student I am
Next, everything was done online in my case for KU
I don't know if it's like that every year
or if it's like that just because of the pandemic
but I didn't really need to mail 
anything during the application period
But, after I got admitted
I was informed that I had to get 
an Apostille for my documents
to certify that they are true and valid
and then I have to submit 
them by February to the school
Now, the essay questions
so I'm not going to disclose the 
essay questions that I answered
because I don't know if it's gonna change
Also like, I can't find the file 
where I wrote all of my essays
I think I deleted it by accident because
I don't like looking back at 
stuff that I'd already submitted
'cause like I'm just gonna see 
the mistakes that I had and
I'm going to be frustrated but
I won't be able to do anything about it anyway
But actually you can access 
the questions on the homepage
There is this area on the 
homepage where you can look at
all of the documents that you have to submit
There's like a whole list of files,
like everything is on there
and then the personal statement is also on there
and they literally give you the questions
so you have time to prepare for it beforehand
Now, interviews!
So I wasn't required to do an interview 
for KU (and Yonsei for that matter)
but I think that if you're an 
international student, you will be
and I don't know how the 
interview works every year
but this year
they literally gave out the 
question on their homepage
and you had to record a video of 
yourself answering that question
and then you had to upload it on their site
Right, so I think that's all for KU
For the process, like the full-blown process
just check out the application guide
like everything is there
it's like crazy detailed
Okay finally we're moving on!
We're moving on to Yonsei
So first, there are application guides 
as well for Yonsei on their homepage
(why is my voice like this part two)
Now for Yonsei's homepage just type  
in yonsei university international admissions
and click the first result
you'll be guided to this page so 
click undergraduate admissions
or apparently, undergradUTE
and you'll see this timeTABLE
and you will be able to download the 
application guide at the bottom of the page
and for overseas Koreans the 
search is a little bit different
so I search 연세대학교 재외국민 특별전형
and get the first result
and you will see the timeTABLE as well
and the applications guides
and you can also select if you're a 
12-year or a 3-year overseas Korean
Okay!
Uh, yeah...
That's
it...
I think
I mean it's pretty much the same
I mean obviously I'm not 
gonna show my grades again
'cause like I submitted the same thing
Yeah but for overseas Koreans, be careful
because you have to select 
the right application guide
like if you're like me, the application guide that
you're following should say 초.중.고
meaning elementary, middle and 
high school overseas, right?
What's different [between KU and Yonsei] is
in my case, for Yonsei there was 
an optional recommendation letter
but for KU, there's no
option
It wasn't even on the list
so I didn't really need to 
submit a recommendation letter
but for Yonsei, the teacher had 
to mail it by a certain deadline
and also, Yonsei has a fee
an application fee of 150,000 
KRW (it's the same for KU)
So for the international students out there,
obviously you saw my grades and 
my extracurricular activities
so I hope that you got an 
idea of like, the situation
no, the standards I had applying 
to the Korean universities
Now, conlclusions
I'm at the conclusions part guys omg
Just a disclaimer!
I have no idea how students 
are evaluated obviously
universities don't give out their 
application [screening] criteria
So I'm just uploading this 
video to help some of you all...
aspiring Korean university students
Everything that I said (claims) was based on
personal experiences and inferences
So, yeah don't quote me on this
Also actually, if you apply to KU in uwayapply
After you finish your 
application, you can actually
check the statistics
I don't know if it's only for my application
we could check the competition rate
like how many students applied and
what are the odds of getting into each college
So that was pretty cool and pretty nerve-wracking
Anyway,
I think that's that
if I missed anything, please 
just comment them down below
or DM me on instagram
if you DM me on instagram it's like,
I'm 100% sure that I will see it
but guys omg
don't DM me like, "Hello"
like, just "Hello"
like I would rather you ask the question in one go
like, "Hello" and then the question
not just like "Hello" 'cause
I am literally so terrified of internet creeps
so I don't really reply to those kind of messages
like if you just say hello or hi,
chances are, I'm not gonna accept the request
so if you guys are gonna ask 
me something on instagram
just ask me the question in one go
So, if this video helped you guys please give it
a big, big, humongous thumbs up
because I spoke way too much
my mouth is dry
So I will be seeing you guys, very soon!
