- Basilan, Mindanao.
For years, Muslim extremist
groups terrorized the island.
They left scars on its people
and scars on what it means to be Muslim.
(reporter speaks in foreign language)
These days are coming to an end.
What I've learned in my
travels is the biggest hearts
are found in the most faraway places.
This is discovering Basilan, part four.
Hey.
Good morning.
Good morning.
It is early.
In this job, you see five
a.m. a lot, actually,
It's something I wasn't
okay with growing up.
I was never really a morning person,
but this job kinda makes
you a morning person
because you see cool stuff in the morning
even if you don't sleep much.
We got about four hours last night.
We've arrived at the grand
mosque, and it is quite grand.
And I found out you can't wear shorts
if you're a man in the mosque.
So we've been given,
what's the name of this?
- [Man] Malong.
- A malong.
It's my last day here.
I'm a little bit sad.
It's about time for
you to put a malong on.
- I did it correctly.
I'm just asking to make it perfect, okay?
Don't judge me, okay?
- [Mike] Are banana t-shirts
allowed in the mosque?
- Yes, absolutely.
- (laughs) Okay.
- [Man] Remove your shoes.
- [Mike] Remove my shoes.
Okay, shoes come off first.
- [Man] Remove your slippers first, okay?
- [Mike] Slippers off first.
- [Man] Yes.
- [Mike] One foot.
- [Man] One foot.
First is the right foot.
That's correct.
That's the right foot.
- [Mike] The right foot's
supposed to go first.
- [Man] Yeah, then the left.
- [Mike] The left foot goes in.
- [Man] Alright, wow.
- [Mike] Amazing.
- [Man] Yeah.
- I feel good.
I look good.
- [Man] You look good.
(Mike laughs)
- There we go.
(man vocalizes)
It's so peaceful in here.
We're arriving at about 5:30.
So the first call of prayer
would have been an hour ago or so.
It looks pretty quiet in here right now,
all very empty right now.
And I guess, well, I haven't
been to any mosques really,
I've been to a bucket load of cathedrals,
especially these old
Spanish colonial cathedrals.
And I just wanna say
like this is quite simple
and minimalistic and beautiful.
There's a little bit of
patterns on the floor,
and there's some interesting
curves and shapes
to the ceiling, but the thing
about going to the cathedral,
there's just walls of statues
and paintings and everything.
It's just a little bit over the top,
where this is very clean and very sleek.
I think it's focused on what's important,
which is the praying.
Here are all of the mats
people would use if you go
to their prayer sequence,
all lined up facing Mecca.
- It's quite amazing what
we build for religion.
This building is incredible.
It's hard enough to feel small and humbled
when you come into places like this.
A big thing we've learned
over the past week
is the portrayal of Muslims in
the world is very, very poor,
always portrayed as violent and extreme.
But here, we've learned
it's basically the opposite.
The language, the actions,
the people are so filled with love.
And yeah, there's a few bad eggs,
especially here in this
corner of Philippines,
but a handful of people are
making millions look bad.
Anyway, it's beautiful here.
I've been alone for about 15 minutes.
It's actually a pretty
good spot to be alone.
Let's find the crew and continue our day.
Okay.
Stop two for the day.
Let me just emphasize
what I said this morning.
One of the coolest things about this job
is never really knowing
what's gonna happen
and ending up in spots really
early that you never expect.
We're at a crab farm.
It's not even seven a.m.
Below me, there is tongs
and tons of king crabs,
which we haven't seen yet.
I think there's a guy with a
bucket trying to fish them out.
We are going to grab some breakfast first,
which is coffee, I always love coffee,
rice wrapped in bamboo
and something else that
I've never had before.
Every day's an adventure.
Every day's exciting.
Let's have breakfast at the crab farm.
Very cool place.
It's rice with chicken, I think.
So for my Mexican subscribers,
this looks a little bit
familiar to what I've had before
in Mexico City which is
tamales, which is ground corn
and meat and you have it for breakfast.
This is called pastel.
It's not corn, but there is meat.
How does it work?
I do this then I put on some soy?
- [Man] Yes.
- [Mike] Can I eat with a spoon?
- [Man] Oh, no, there is a--
- [Mike] Oh, it's already cracked.
There we go, there we go.
And here we go.
I don't know, guys.
I've eaten some weird stuff in my life,
and this is pretty weird.
- [Kyle] That was a joke, right?
(group laughs)
- It's delicious.
We've got rice.
We've got some meat.
We've got some soy.
What is there not to like?
You eat this part too, right?
- [Kyle] How do you say it?
- [Man] Bunig.
- [Kyle] Bunog?
- Bunig, bunig.
- So bunog, bunog.
- [Man] Bunig.
- Bunig, bunog, bunog.
- Bunig, bunig.
- [Kyle] Bunog.
You're bunog.
- [Man] Bunig in Maguindanao--
- Apparently, I didn't realize
there's a second course to breakfast.
Since we are on a crab
farm, what is round two?
- I have the king crabs.
I have the mud crabs.
Also, that is what you
call mangrove crabs.
- [Mike] King crabs, mud
crabs, mangrove crabs.
I've never had crabs before.
- Look at that.
That is a crab, man.
- [Mike] That's breakfast right there.
- [Kyle] That is exotic.
- [Mike] Exotic, yeah. (laughs)
- [Kyle] Yeah, these
little eggs here, see that?
- [Mike] It's the best part.
It's almost like cheese, right?
- Yeah, it is good.
That's the high blood
part though. (laughs)
Oh, yeah!
Now we're getting serviced, man.
- [Man] This is yours.
- [Mike] This is mine?
- [Man] Yeah, you try.
- Thank you very much.
First crab claw of the day.
We have our sawsawan which is--
- Ginger, vinegar, and
black pepper, sugar, chili.
That's all.
- All kinds of good stuff.
We have someone who's kindly
cracking all the crab shell,
which for me, crab is delicious
but it's a bit of work to open it up.
Yeah, someone's doing
that for us this morning.
And we'll take a bit of the eggs.
The Filipinos love the eggs, yeah?
- Aligue.
- Aligue.
Kinda tastes like crab-flavored cheese.
Let's keep going.
Now I've been given the
crab juices in the shell,
which apparently is one of the best parts.
And they've added some sawsawan,
the vinegar with the chilies and garlic.
And I guess this is one of the delicacies
is you drink all of the
juice out of the head.
- And that is aphrodisiac.
- Of course, it's an aphrodisiac. (laughs)
It seems like everything
that looks like this
is an aphrodisiac.
You can see the eggs.
You can see a lot of the digestive system.
Um, yeah.
What time is it?
- [Kyle] Seven.
- Seven.
Bottoms up.
It seems like this is a hangover
cure or something, right?
Oh, that tastes like
every seafood in the ocean
mixed together, very salty, very fishy.
And actually, you even
taste a lot of the eggs,
so it actually tastes a
bit like cheese, honestly.
Great. (laughs)
- [Kyle] Good morning.
- Good morning.
Good morning from Cotabato City.
- [Kyle] How do you say
good morning in Maguindanao?
(man speaks in foreign language)
(group speaks in foreign language)
- (speaks in foreign
language) from Cotabato City.
Do you want some?
- Um, later.
It looks good though.
- We are back in the Lanao del Sur booth,
and we're looking at these
beautiful kris knives.
Look at this.
The serpentine sword.
Actually, this is the symbol of ARMM.
You can see this on the logo.
People were saying I had to pick one up.
And some of them like, look
at the detail in the hilt,
carved into the sword itself.
Everything is just so incredible.
- This is what you call gurok.
- A gurok?
- Maranao, gurok.
(woman speaks in foreign language)
- For picture only.
- For picture only, you have
a cap.
- A hat.
Let's put it on.
- Oh, yeah, cap from Maranao.
- Look at this.
It's beautiful though.
I'm gonna have to get some.
I'm gonna have to get some.
The small ones are only a thousand.
This one is 18,000, which is
a bit out of my price range,
but look at the carved
wood and the carved steel.
We'll get some cheaper ones
for friends and family,
and maybe a big one for myself to protect
against any robbers that decide
to come to my house. (laughs)
I love these.
I've gotten three.
- He is my buena mano.
How handsome is you.
(Mike laughs)
Maybe all beautiful girl
can crush you in Mindanao.
- What is she doing right now?
What is this?
- [Man] Buena mano.
- What's buena mano?
- [Man] It's like for good luck.
- Good luck.
- Good luck.
- First buyers.
- Oh, the first buyer gets--
- Yes.
- Oh, okay.
- [Woman] Like this.
(Mike laughs)
Yes.
- I've never seen that before.
- If you have store, like this.
- The first money I give you,
on everything for good luck.
- Oh, yeah.
- I can feel it.
I can feel the good luck.
- Your nose is so strong.
- My nose is so strong. (chuckles)
I do.
I've got a big one.
But I can smell a lot of things.
So that's hilarious.
I have three kris knives.
This big one, which is
gorgeous, it was 6,000 pesos,
which is like 110 American dollars.
And two smaller ones
I'll give for gifts to friends and family.
Really happy that they have
these because they're amazing.
Some people on Instagram
told me to check out the kris knives.
We found them here in Cotabato City.
- And this is your change.
- This is my change.
- From Philippines, from Mindanao.
Money from Mindanao.
- Thank you so much.
Do I go like this?
- Yes.
(Mike laughs)
- Thank you, thank you, thank you.
- Thank you.
Do they mano here, mano?
- Mano.
(Mike laughs)
- Alright, man, that's it.
That's like, that's my entire
almost Filipino experience.
So right now, I've got my souvenirs.
We're going back to the
hotel so I can pack up,
and then I get in the
van to go to the plane
to go to Manila, to go out of
Philippines, unfortunately.
So let's get packed up
and let's hit the road.
Alright, we are back in the
center of Cotabato City,
and this is the goodbye that I have been
not looking forward to for about a month.
We've traveled around Mindanao together.
We've traveled in Basilan together.
Now we're saying goodbye, man.
- We're saying goodbye in Cotabato City,
in the capital of ARMM,
but we're still in each other's arms.
- Aw, always with the
corny jokes. (laughs)
- Go, man, rock on.
- I love you, man.
Thank you so much for the opportunity.
I'm sure my subscribers loved it as well.
For me, it was an awesome
opportunity to see
a part of the world that
I didn't know much about.
And so now, I'm really happy
that I get to share the love,
share the happiness, and show the people
places that are really cool
and no one knows.
- Yeah, man.
And there's tons of stuff
that they've got here.
And I'm squinting from the sun,
so we're gonna keep it short.
Rock on.
You're welcome anytime.
My house is open to you.
Everybody's welcome here.
- Well, for me, I'm off to Bosnia,
and that's gonna start in three, two, one.
And hello.
Bosnia.
Well, that, my friends, is
the end of the Basilan series
that was four days traveling
with Kulas and Kumar
of Becoming Filipino.
I have to say when I first told people
I was going to Mindanao, even
with the Fighter Boys trip
before that, and even
especially when I said Basilan,
the people said, a couple
of people in particular,
looked at me like I was stupid
and said, "What are you trying to prove?"
These people had no idea about
the place they've never been.
They had only seen a few
news articles about Mindanao.
And I was judged like I
was some reckless cowboy
trying to be like a jackass
of the travel world,
doing crazy things just
for the clicks and views.
I hope, I hope you can see
that through this series
with the Fighter Boys and in Basilan
that it was much, much more than that.
What I learned very quickly
and what I suspected beforehand
was the people in Mindanao,
the people in Basilan,
the people all through ARMM
are beautiful, incredible,
generous, heart (sighs), heartfelt people.
And they were eager to share that
with anybody they can come across.
And what I was trying to
prove, answering the question
to these people who were
judging me, is trying to prove
that these people are
totally misunderstood,
and you should stop
judging them so quickly
when you hear news reports.
That being said, there was a news report
shortly after we left, only
a few weeks, that in Basilan,
on the morning of July 31st,
at 5:30 a.m., a white van
pulled up to a military
checkpoint in Lamitan City.
There was one person in the van.
They said that he was not
speaking in the local dialect.
The van exploded, killing 10 people.
We were actually there.
We went through that location.
And so hearing that news and
after finishing this series
and leaving, because I
hope you realize that
for a lot of YouTubers, we
can't always create the content
and then post it immediately.
A lot of it is creating
and then having to go back
and post it later when we can edit.
So at that point, I had already been gone
out of the Philippines for a short time.
It was very shocking and very sad for me
because I just knew that this,
at this point, random act,
was just furthering the misconception
about these areas being terrifying.
And I'm not discounting
what happened as being not terrifying.
It definitely was.
But one thing that the
military that we traveled with,
the armed personnel of the
governor, when I spoke to people
on the boat, on the different
forms of transportation,
when I spoke to everybody,
including the governor himself, he said,
"Yes, the Abu Sayyaf were
a big problem in the past.
"Most have turned themselves in.
"There's a small percentage,
1/10 or something
"of what the number they used
to be, hiding in the forest.
"They have not given us
trouble for a long time,
"and they are being defeated.
"They are slowly, slowly being assimilated
"back into the population,
slowly going away.
"And hopefully, very soon,
they won't be a problem."
And right after that, there was a problem.
The fact though that they
said that this was not someone
who spoke the local language,
because he could not
understand the questions,
makes many people think that
he was not from Basilan.
He was from somewhere else,
and he arrived to do this particularly.
He was a suicide bomber
and apparently was the first
ever suicide bomber attack.
And he was trying to get
the van to Lamitan City
but was caught at the checkpoint.
People were pressing investigations.
They were tipped off as well.
The military knew there
could be a white van
coming through with some
improvised explosive devices on it.
He was caught, it exploded,
and I was terrible.
So I guess what I'm
saying is in these places,
these things do happen.
We knew that Basilan had a dark past.
We knew it was going away.
But like anything, there
still is, obviously,
a little bit of risk there.
Would I go back?
I would still go back.
Would I go back with some security?
I would go back with
some security as well.
Mindanao, the giant island,
after being a month
there was totally fine.
Basilan I still think has a
little bit of work left to do,
but I feel bad when I say that
because we had such an incredible time.
And I really feel like this
was an act of desperation.
Most people feel like this
is an act of desperation
from a group that's
slowly being eliminated
and assimilated back into society
and they're like, "We
have to do something crazy
"because we're losing this battle."
And after traveling to
Basilan for four days,
five days with Kulas and Kumar,
I feel they're losing that battle.
I have never felt so accepted
and loved in my entire life.
So my heart goes out to the people
who passed away during that blast.
My heart goes out to Mindanao.
There are areas that are still
having problems in Mindanao,
which are very, very few,
Marawi in particular, Basilan as well.
And I am looking forward
very soon to the days
where there won't be problems
and the rest of the world can come down
and see all of these
beautiful places and things.
Well, the light is fading
and I want to give you one
more nugget of good news.
In this video, it was my last
few days in the Philippines.
Then I did leave to go to Bosnia,
go to all kinds of places, Bulgaria.
But how I've been editing this series,
my Filipino series is actually,
there is more videos coming.
I still have videos left of Sagada
when I went up to see the hanging coffins,
and I got to have etag and see Whang-Od.
There's still two more
episodes left there.
There's also more in Coron,
visiting the shipwrecks
and some other little gems and nuggets.
So I'm excited to say that
even though in this series,
I say I'm leaving the
Philippines, I did it a little bit
out of order and I still have
a few more episodes left.
So my dragons, thank you for watching
this special series in Basilan.
I'm looking forward to sharing
these last few Philippines
videos with you.
I will be back next year.
I already know and have some
ideas of where I wanna go.
If you know anything that
could be of interest to me,
strange, unique places, it
could be cultural events,
it could be cool tribes to
live with, it could be tattoo,
it could be anything, things
that you think would fit
on the channel, please let me know
and I'll make an itinerary
for my trip back to the
Philippines next year.
Thank you, my dragons.
See you in the next episode.
Experiences over possessions.
(laid back music)
