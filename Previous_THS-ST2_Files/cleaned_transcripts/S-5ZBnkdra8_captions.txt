We're back with Marcelito
Pomoy, and so you just
sang "The Prayer,"
and now you're
gonna sing "Beauty
and the Beast," right?
Yes.
And both from Celine
Dion, who you love.
Yes.
Yes.
Celine Dion is [INAUDIBLE] my
favorite singer ever since--
because all the songs on the--
Celine Dion, [INAUDIBLE]
and "The Prayer"
is the one
[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]..
He said all Celine Dion songs
are what he loves to sing
but more specifically
he loves "The Prayer"
because that's the song
that changed my life.
Wow.
Well, yes, it's pretty amazing.
All right, you're gonna
sing for us one more time.
OK.

[MUSIC - CELINE DION AND PEABO
 BRYSON, "BEAUTY AND THE BEAST"]
Tale as old as time,
true as it can be.
Barely even friends, then
somebody bends unexpectedly.
Just a little
change, small to say
the least, both a little
scared, neither one prepared,
Beauty and the Beast.
[AUDIENCE CHEERING]
Thank you so much.
Thank you so much.
OK.
And the thing is
like, OK, like I said,
he was living on the
streets from the time
he was seven years
old until he was 24,
he's never had vocal coaching,
no voice lessons at all,
and you have that voice.
It's unbelievable.
[AUDIENCE CHEERING AND
 APPLAUDING]
Thank you.
I mean, really, really good.
All right, so you
love Celine Dion.
She's my friend, I called
Celine, told her about you,
she wants to meet you.
So you're gonna go to Vegas,
you're gonna see her show--
Oh.
--you're gonna go
backstage, and you're
gonna see her at Caesar's
in Las Vegas, and meet her.
[AUDIENCE CHEERING]
Thank you so much.
