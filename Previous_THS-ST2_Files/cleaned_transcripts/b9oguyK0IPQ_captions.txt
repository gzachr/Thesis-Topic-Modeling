[Music] hey everyone welcome back to our discovering
Philippines series if you caught our last
video you'll know that we just made the incredible
three-day boat Journey from Corona to El Nido
stopping at amazing secluded beaches all along
the way after that epic adventure we decided
to laylo and El Nido to catch up on some editing
and also really soak in the Island Vibes we've
got to know the place really well so in today's
video we're going to take you around El Nido
to show you some of the best things you can
do over the next two days
so definitely the most popular thing to do
here in El Nido is to go on a island hopping
tour so that is what we're going to do today
and I think we're getting really lucky because
the weather looks really beautiful so far
all right so we've signed into our tour and
they gave us these fun kind of funny pink
stickers apparently it's so that they can
identify which tour group we're in so if you
go to El Nido and you look for the two island
hopping tours there are four main tours that
are basically offered by all the tour operators
here that's tour A B C or D and it's all like
controlled that way like the itinerary so
that I think there's less Chaos on the shores
here yeah and it's actually all the same price
like every true operator has to stick to the
same price which is kind of neat so you don't
have to shop around for the different price
points but you do need to shop around for
is the best company yeah so the company that
we chose to go with today is Umi travels and
tours we've just heard such good things about
them some great reviews really good reviews
online and then we're gonna be doing the two
or C so two or a and two or C are probably
the most popular tours here in El Nido tour
8 just being a little bit more popular and
and therefore a little bit more crowded we
think so we opted to go with two or C yeah
just because I think it's going to be really
great views and like not as many people hopefully
and apparently like lots of nice little secret
beaches in this tour so we'll see we're Super
Stone well it only took like maybe 20 minutes
on the boat but we're like I feel like we're
like inside the Limestone Hills of course
I don't want you cold in here it's so beautiful
there are a bunch of boats here I think this
is our first stop [Music] thank you
all right the name of our first stop we have
both forgotten we put it on the screen somewhere
but it's gonna meet you actually to get out
and kayak too you can swim but there's a lot
of coral and it gets really shallow so these
are just kayaking and a heads up it is 300X
per pesos to rent the kayak to go into the
Lagoon and kayak around so keep that in mind
so far it's absolutely gorgeous yeah to be
honest I thought we were going to a beach
first and just gonna be jumping off and getting
on a beach and then we start off with a lagoon
but I'm actually I'm pretty okay with it yeah
it's so beautiful stunning like the Limestone
cars I don't know what to call them what crafts
yeah they're absolutely beautiful the water
is so turquoise we can like see all the coral
underneath us it is really cool to be in a
kayak I think swimming would be difficult
people are doing it but uh they have life
jackets on so they're nice and buoyant because
I think that would uh you'd definitely risk
kicking your knees on Coral here I love the
color of this water it's just so it's crazy
how clear it is the visibility the visibility
is it also helps that we have a really like
sunny day yeah we got so much for the weather
and it's just it's just making everything
look so beautiful so ahead here I think we're
gonna get to like a deeper portion and it's
all blue maybe we can go for a dip I really
want to get in the pot [Music]
hey guys where do you think hidden beaches
you can get through all the books are
you got the hiddenness of the Hidden Beach
is kind of given away by the fact that there
are a ton of boats in front of these rocks
yeah stop number two is literally
it's here somewhere
so this is a gorgeous Beach um I will say
we know We've joked about it it's not very
hidden everybody's here but it's hidden you
know you can't see it from outside true it
is hidden it's not secret it's not someone's
coming but it's hidden like you can't see
her outside it's like a Runway of water like
there's rocks on either side it looks so shallow
and like by the time the water gets up here
it's actually very calm so funny thing when
I was flying the Drone I almost feel like
I'm doing a little bit of reconnaissance because
I can kind of get a lay of the land and I
saw something interesting while I was up in
the sky there
let me see if we can get there oh my gosh
guys look at this this is the secret of Hidden
Beach I have more Hidden Beach and you know
what there's absolutely nobody here we weren't
able to see this on the other side at all
it looks like this probably just ocean across
these rocks but you never would have expected
there's another smaller Beach here what do
you think that's pretty great it happened
pretty good
[Music] [Applause] oh
[Music]
after a little bit of a choppy takeoff from
Hidden Beach we turned the corner and all
of a sudden we're in this really quiet Serene
like just beautiful Waterway yeah a little
Cove between these islands yeah it looks like
it's a place where everyone stops for lunch
but all the islands are taken so we're eating
lunch foreign
I got lots of seafood because in heaven because
there was like six seafood dishes plus that
is chicken and that's pork and of course rice
so it's a good day for Mikko what about you
I have Bunsen I had chicken and pork as well
okay we are at our fourth stop of the day
this is secret Beach there's no Beach right
now because you can't see it because it's
a big secret except everybody's still here
so that's no secret it's a bit of a hairy
start though because we gotta swim there inside
all these big rocks
okay so um all of the spots so far I think
this is one of the top three this is my favorite
four four yeah oh my god this is my favorite
it was like just the right amount of Adventure
to getting yeah yeah that's true right it's
like a little little adrenaline it was and
now it's so stinking beautiful in here I love
it it's so cool I love just the enclosure
of it that's like how secluded it seems and
uh we got our snorkels weird there's not much
to look at right where we are now but at the
entrance there the coral was amazing yeah
really like pink and red and stuff it's beautiful
people I'm pretty sure like home in Canada
this would not be allowed we can see this
tiny little like hole in the wall I feel like
if you get the wrong way if you like would
hit yourself in the world against the Rocks
yeah I don't think it could be a go at home
no I think there'd be a lot more uh safety
nets in place as if as in they were just they
don't come here you're not allowed I love
it though because it's super cool but we survived
yeah we're fine
[Music] thank you so we have made it to the
last stop of the day I can't believe we've
already hit five different places so this
is helicopter Island so called because it
looks like a helicopter um also our ice cream
has also brought us a a new friend where is
he
um but we've actually been to this uh helicopter
Island before yeah off the shore not on the
not on the beach that was the last week when
my parents were still with us we made scuba
diving we didn't film it we just enjoyed the
day with my parents but it was so incredible
scuba diving here is out of this world I had
no idea actually that Palawan has some of
the most amazing diving in the entire world
so good we saw so many different animals like
there was incredible beautiful coral and tons
of just like fish in general here there was
so much marine life and then on top of that
we saw some really cool bigger animals like
a really big puffer fish remember that yeah
giant puffer fish that looks like it has a
human face we also saw some blue spotted stingrays
which was so beautiful we saw what was that
green one yeah shrimp I think yeah it's like
a giant shrimp I didn't know they looked like
that I didn't realize they were so green I
thought it was like a lobster but our guys
said it was a shrimp and then we had the most
incredible dive with a bunch of sea turtles
it was wonderful that was probably the highlight
of the diving for me um was just seeing the
sea turtles getting up close to like this
big big turtle and I I think my favorite moment
must be when we had that almost like a swimming
race where the giant almost 100 year old Turtle
it was incredible yeah Miku and I and this
Turtle just like swimming along we saw a bunch
of turtles on that dive but anyways it was
amazing honestly scuba diving if you have
an extra day here in El Nido we highly recommend
spending one day doing some scuba diving can
I resist hey we're gonna take the chocolate
off I don't want you to get the stick I don't
want to hurt yourself here there's a little
more I'll help you okay really quick before

El Nido
good morning everyone welcome to day two of
exploring El Nido in today's itinerary we
are going to be actually checking out some
of the area outside of El Nido town and the
best way to do that is to rent a scooter so
that's the first thing we ought to do today
so uh we just got our bike there's lots of
bike shops in El Nido so they're they're dime
a dozen they all charge pretty much the same
thing 500 pesos for a day on the scooter but
I think this one's the funniest one because
this one also has like a ton of roosters for
some unknown reason just hang it out around
the bikes so it could be a bike shop and a
chicken shop at the same time I think I think
that only comes in the Philippines all right
so El Nino's kind of a neat tourist town it
is just a couple of blocks honestly like maybe
five or six blocks and they are very touristy
we're going down the main one right now which
parallels the water so you can see tons of
like and shopping next to us like souvenir
shops lots of really nice clothing shops this
is one of our favorite places to grab a bite
it's called Maas Grill I think I'm saying
that correctly they've got delicious at Curry
and some good what do you always get pork
belly pork belly it's really affordable too
yeah and there's like this little market right
here bringing in all kinds of like kind of
knickknacky souvenirs if you really want a
fun night out there is a karaoke up here I
think every night I'm not exactly sure but
you can have an epic time singing karaoke
there we've had some good times there we have
had some good times there yes we have this
will be the day
you're looking for more night out Adventures
Amigos it's a great place to to go more of
a club seat so definitely need a little more
energy for that one this is the store that
we actually did our scuba diving through they
were wonderful highly recommend them and then
right across from them is Gusto gelato they
have incredible Crepes awesome Crepes for
120 pesos if you need a little snack or you're
craving something sweet that is the place
to do it and there's a yeah a place called
friends it's a really popular hostel here
a lot of things to do Rooftop Bar a rooftop
rooftop pool and our bar yeah so if you're
looking for party scene or maybe you're here
by yourself and you're wanting to meet people
Friends Hospital is apparently the place to
go there is like more to El Nino town it's
just that it's a little further away and it's
towards an area that's called coron coron
Beach we're going to take you there later
today so we'll kind of show you the rest of
like of El Nido area but this part that we
just drove down right now this is definitely
like the main tourist section [Music] thank
you [Music] foreign [Music] we have made it
to nakpan beach it is sunny it is a beautiful
beach and it's a beautiful day today this
is a really long beach by the way yeah so
what makes that pan Beach so like famous is
because it's just such a Long Beach compared
to a lot of the other beaches around El Nido
and you get a thousand nice spots to enjoy
the beach from it's I think it's cool because
you can get in anywhere like the whole like
the water is stunning there's no seaweed there's
no Coral like this well maybe there's a little
coral on the one side but you can definitely
get in to go for a nice swim so despite doing
pretty much nothing we're starving and we
decided to grab some lunch at the place where
we were sitting in front I've got on yeah
which is like tiny little like glass noodles
with vegetables and I just got the veggie
one you can get it with chicken I think as
well or you can get the thick noodle version
of Princess because it is like possibly one
of my favorite Filipino dishes because it's
basically just yummy noodles so it's an easy
one to try if you're new to Filipino food
and I got the chicken caldereta chicken caldereta
or the card called the red sauce I think it's
a very specific sauce and very popular one
here in the Philippines chicken caldereta
and rice so good but Nicole's already diving
in it's amazing we also got spring rolls what
else do they call them again lumpia lumpia
so these are the chicken lumpia oh here listen
to that crunch oh my God that sounds so good
wow I love the sauce so I quickly got to say
something now that we've been chilling on
this beach for a little while and we've spent
we've been spending a lot of time on Philippines
beaches I have come to notice how much Filipinos
love playing on the beach whether it's in
the sand or in the water it is just part of
our nature and I laugh because you know we
know another Filipino like that yeah growing
up she's seen me play like in the sand put
the sand all over my head and my hair like
everywhere downstairs every time we're on
a beach it's just like covering himself in
sand and I realized it wasn't just simply
a personality trait for me it is like in my
blood as we're sitting here just relaxing
on the beach there are I've been watching
so many Filipinos just having a blast in the
water and in the sense like in the sand Rolling
In The Sand cover themselves on the sand pulling
each other in the sand I'm like covering each
other I hate that feeling and every time I
was like I can't believe you're doing that
and now we're like hanging around I'm like
maybe a Filipino thing it's a thing it's a
real thing and it totally makes sense behind
us here there's like a full-on game happening
too like a I don't know there's teams involved
there's it's a competition it is maybe very
Filipino maybe I should join them I think
it's time for Nicole to finally join in nope
and a country full of people love to play
in The Sound I got a great book to read no
[Music]
we're on our way to another Beach outside
Beach
road going the opposite direction
so the sun isn't even setting yet and you're
gonna already see why you come to corong parong
beach for epic Sunset it's so beautiful like
so nice the water is so flat and then you
have all the boats uh on top that it just
with all the islands in the background there
is another Beach here that has pretty good
views for Sunset it's called vanilla Beach
but there's like this like little Hill or
Mountain wherever you call it and that juts
right in front of where the sun sets so if
you want a cool Sunset spot coron coron Beach
is definitely the one to choose
it's actually been a super relaxing day we've
really enjoyed going around El Nido but we're
gonna enjoy the rest of this Sunset and leave
you guys there in the next video we'll be
exploring more Philippines we're not exactly
sure what we're up to yeah don't know where
we're going yet but maybe cue some b-roll
of what we're doing next thanks for watching
guys see you then
