pininyahan manok and my mom is going to help me

pineapple juice to the chicken

and pogi is looking at the chicken
it's all chicken so now we're 
going to prepare the garlic  
and onions so we have some onions here 
fresh onions and garlic cut the onions
now we are going to fry the chicken  
okay so we're gonna turn on this pot so i'll 
add a little bit of mantika but not so much  
ma so you can add the garlic and the onions 
the onions i also cut a little bit of ginger  
see there's a bit of ginger here which we will add 
later do you use ginger in pinanyahang manok? i do
so stirring the onions sibuyas and bawang how 
does it smell oh so wonderful oh i like it so much
this dish from the philippines is a first time for 
me to cook it so today i will cook it with my mom
yeah so we're going to add the manok  
one by one one by one so without the 
juice we're gonna keep the pineapple juice
so we will make sure to brown the chicken first  
on all sides and we're gonna 
set aside the uh pineapple juice
so next we're gonna cook the 
rice my mom is going to add the  
pineapple juice and we added a 
little bit of ginger okay request
so pineapple juice ginger
smells amazing  
so i'm also going to add a 
little bit of water not too much  
just a little bit so i'll add a little 
bit of gatta as well not so much
it's one third of a can and you can cover it
yeah for the oven effect so we're gonna leave it 
on for a while like this maybe for 20 30 minutes  
and now we're gonna cook the rice which is the 
most important ingredient for filipino food  
so you can add one cube of chicken stock as 
well to make it really nice flavor flavor pork
so that's the rice okay so next we're gonna cut 
the bell pepper we're using a red bell pepper here
the new one inside baby so i don't think 
we need to cut it too fine right or  
what do you think i think we can keep some chunks
so i just cut it like these size sizes so it 
has been 20 minutes my mom is going to add patis
so we're adding about two tablespoons of patisse  
also the bell pepper we're gonna 
add the bell pepper as well

so i'm not sure if we forgot anything but 
uh the final step we're gonna do is the  
pineapple you can add the pineapple map yeah 
so we're going to add the pineapple chunks
maybe some sili
you can taste it ma can i taste the soup
a little bit of the sauce to see how 
the saltiness is how is the saltiness  
wonderful yeah wonderful oh good maybe something 
enough then for me enough okay yeah yeah so  
i removed the lid and we're going to let 
this boil for maybe 10-15 more minutes  
so that the sauce reduces and then 
we we are ready to serve with rice

with the pineapple i like it very much
from the philippines so my mom would like the 
chicken to be a little bit softer so we're gonna  
let the rest of the chicken be in the pot you know 
get softer a little bit so let me try this one
the sauce is really nice you can really taste 
that pineapple very nice and the chicken
