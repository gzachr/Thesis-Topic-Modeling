- In 1975, in Cubao, Quezon City,
Tony Tan Caktiong and his family
opened the Magnolia Ice Cream Parlor.
Per the request of customers,
they soon started serving hot meals
and eventually those hot meals
became more popular than the ice cream.
So in 1978, they closed
that ice cream parlor down
and opened the very first Jollibee.
Now, Jollibee has over
1,300 locations globally,
with 1,150 of those in the Philippines.
I have seen countless comments
requesting I do this menu.
So this video better crush.
I'm talking five mil in a week.
I'm counting on you Philippines.
I need every single person in
the Philippines to watch this
and every single
Filipino-American to watch it too.
Tell your friends, tell your family.
Also, you should tell
your friends and family
about Keith's Chicken Sauce and
Keith's Habers Burger Sauce.
Delicious hot sauces for your mouth.
What pleasures await you?
All right, let's Eat the Menu.
(upbeat music)
All right, let's Eat the Menu.
It smells amazing in here.
I'm so excited for breakfast,
everything's like a combo meal.
I saw a glimpse of one
that looked like a bunch
of pieces of steak,
that's what I call breakfast.
Let's Eat this Menu, yum yum.
All right, what do we got in here?
The longanisa pork sausage,
lo-gah-nisa, long-ga-nisa.
The pork sausage meal.
This is a full sausage link.
Do other fast food places
have sausage links?
It's like a candied chicken
apple sausage smell,
but I think it's pork.
(upbeat music)
Chews like sausage,
tastes like a sweet bacon.
I'm very into that.
Little over hard for me.
So it'd be like a hard-boiled
eggs, but one and flat.
This is your way to go.
We're starting strong here, Jollibee.
Way to go, congratulations so far.
Corned beef breakfast.
Like corned beef hash
situation going on here.
That's awesome.
This is a very American like
Southern, you know, American,
not South American,
North America, USA-ian.
I used to love making corned beef hash
in Chicago in the morning.
Heavy breakfast though.
(upbeat music)
That's good corn beef hash.
Noodle?
What do you think that is?
Crap, it's a hunk of fat.
Not a noodle, you got me.
Hell, yeah, are you kidding me?
Look at what the (bleep) is this?
This is the Tocino, the sweet pork.
Now, this looks a lot like
the pork I had in Hawaii.
It looks candied, smells
candied, tastes candied.
Very sweet and bright pork.
A nice savory flavor.
A nice blend of those two.
Garlic, holy, it's garlic rice.
Garlic rice is a good way to wake up
if you don't like coffee.
That woke me up, that
bite it got me going.
Look at this, it's just pieces of beef.
Beef Tenders, my Tapa breakfast.
Let's try the Tapa.
That is just jarred
minced garlic poured in.
I'm gonna put a little
burger sauce on this
'cause I know the burger is great on steak
and I'll be like, this
is basically just steak.
That is awesome
It kind of reminds me
a beef jerky actually.
And there is like the
sweetness buried inside.
It's definitely marinated.
Very good beef burger sauce.
And now it's time for the
final breakfast option.
Bone in fried chicken on a egg with rice.
Now, I get a little breakfast chicken.
They know me so well.
Maybe I shouldn't eat it until
I have the chicken later,
but maybe I'll just have it right now too
and just pretend I haven't had it later.
The only other times I've had
fried chicken in the morning
is when it's like leftover fried chicken.
So it's given me leftover
fried chicken vibes,
even though it's not leftover.
The egg I lost entirely.
The garlic rice is just so flavorful.
Now, I'm actually filming this
after I've had everything else.
And I probably would've
said that my favorite thing
was actually the breakfast.
So I'm gonna give a
special mention right now
to the breakfast, it's delicious.
If you can get the Jollibee breakfast,
I highly recommend pretty much any item.
It actually is very comforting
like an American breakfast,
just a little bit asian.
And we all like that, don't we?
Oh, there's some gravy.
Well, I know this is
just around the corner.
So let's save the gravy for the next bee.
The Jollisides.
All right, let's start with
these French fries, the fries.
Look at this little guy,
look at this little bee.
I think he is physically
a jolly bee, a jovial bee.
They smell like straight up McDonald's.
Not as salty as you expect.
Overall, the fries are fine.
I wouldn't call them jolly fries.
I call them fine fries, okay fries,
somewhat good spirited fries.
White rice, wow.
Haven't had this since Jack in the Box
and it was not good in Jack in the Box.
If you're a member Jack in the Box,
I fully thought I was going to die.
It smells like it's made with the water
that they use to wash dishes
after the dishes have been washed.
So I'm very excited today to have a menu
that's not over 100 items.
The white rice.
Bonus points if the workers
are actually making it
by putting their finger in the pot
because I hear that's how
you're supposed to do it.
For fast food rice it's not bad.
Actually, It's pretty good.
I don't hate that at all.
I'm gonna try it with some gravy.
I don't know if you're supposed to.
Oh yeah, holy cow that gravy is amazing.
I'm into it.
Huh, rice, who knew you
can make rice taste good
without really doing much to it.
Take that white people.
We are not good at making rice.
Becky and I made rice for
the first time following
some Asian TikToker who was like,
you gotta make it like this,
listen up white people.
So we were white people and we
listened up and he was right.
Our rice has never come out so good.
This is the adobo rice.
I imagine it's got pieces of
chicken adobo, adobo chicken.
It's obviously a very seasoned rice.
It smells really good.
Yeah, it's a very mildly
flavored but savory.
Oh man, you could crack an egg on this.
As a hangover food, this would be so good.
It's like just a little bit salty,
just a little bit savory
but also very like plain.
I just need to fill my
guts up with something.
I kind of wanna just sip the gravy
Good gravy, let's eat.
What is it.
(slurping)
I don't (beep) know.
It reminds me of Thanksgiving,
but not my Thanksgiving, you know?
Well, let's have it on
what it's supposed to be on
the mashed potatoes.
The first sniff reminds me
of elementary school instant potatoes.
Oh, (beep) that's really good.
I wanna dip a chicken leg into this.
You know me?
It is very lovably cheap.
You know it is instant potatoes.
These tastes like elementary
school but it's good.
It's like it makes me happy.
It makes me ask if like my
friend Dave is done with his
and then I put my tray against his tray.
That's how you don't lose any.
'Cause some people are like lift it over.
I'm like, what are you doing?
You're gonna (beep) drop food on the table
and then you're missing a morsel.
You gotta line them up side to side
then you scrape it over.
And that's how you get
all of your friends food
in elementary school.
I wasn't bullied and would still be
because I just asked for enough food
to probably build a whole second lunch.
Now, let's try some traditional classics.
I don't know what to title these
because all these things
are a little bit different.
This is the Jolly
spaghetti, Jolly's-ghetti.
So jolly.
I know that this is made totally different
than our spaghetti.
It's got hot dogs in it.
It's got some like ground beef in it.
It's got some other stuff in it.
It smells pretty much like
I would say chef priority
Oh no, it doesn't, let's try it.
(open mouth chewing)
I honestly can't describe
this flavor to you.
It tastes kind of sugary.
The hotdogs barely tastes
like hot dogs, barely.
It's basically sweet
spaghetti with hot dogs.
I think I recommend it for children.
I don't recommend it for me.
However, I think if this is
something you grew up eating,
you'd probably find comfort in it.
But it is bizarre.
I don't know how to describe this
to you America and the world.
What does it taste like?
That tastes like sugar
spaghetti with hotdog.
Is it good?
I don't know.
Is it bad, I don't think so.
Do I like it, sure, yeah.
Now, joining me on Eat the Menu Jollibee
is everybody's favorite
little Baker, Alex Lewis.
- Hello, everybody.
It's time for everyone's favorite segment.
Alex brought some cookies
to the all you can eat
eating the menu time.
Here's the thing,
the last time I brought you brownies
you didn't like them.
- [Keith] Well, you made them
with the wrong ingredient.
- That's right, I sure did.
But I wanted to make up
for my past mistakes.
So Keith, these cookies have
brownies inside of them.
- Are you kidding?
- I am not.
- That's genius, Alex.
This is a great, you've outdone yourself.
First of all, the cookie
part is really good.
It's a really good chocolate chip cookie.
Careful on those dabs as well.
- Sorry, definitely hit
myself in the temple.
- And you're Jewish so
temple means a lot more.
- Oh, not so far
(clapping)
- Great job Alex.
Unfortunately Alex does
he have a girlfriend now?
So all these baking things
they don't help you.
- What, what is that?
- All right, let's move on.
- Palobok Fiesta, oh la.
- I feel like this looks delicious.
- It does look really good.
It kind of looks like a Pad Thai
- It does look like a Pad Thai.
- But with thinner rice noodles.
I think this is egg, little shrimp
and it's got some breadcrumbs
or crushed pork rind.
- What, crushed pork rinds.
- We'll eat from different
sides of the box.
We all have been tested for coronavirus
and we're all negative.
All right, let's try it.
(upbeat music)
That is a different flavor.
- I like that.
- I like it too but coming off
of brownie cookie, hard left.
- I'm having a great time over here.
I've never enjoyed a new meal
on Eat the Menu this much.
The egg really is kind of nauseating
but everything else is...
- You can't eat the egg now.
- I know it looks disgusting.
- I ate the egg and it was good.
I find that hard-boiled eggs is the york
that's the hardest part to consume.
- That looks like an eyeball.
- Let's try the burger steak meal.
I think this is gonna be delicious.
This looks like Salisbury steak.
I'm excited for the burger steak.
- [Alex] What the (beep)
is going on in here.
- [Keith] It's burger and
mushrooms and gravy and rice.
I'll take a burger steak,
you take a burger steak.
I'll take a mushroom, you take a mushroom.
- Oh, okay.
- [Keith] Maybe do a one
two, a little split fork.
- I'm gonna do one, two.
- Okay let's go.
(upbeat music)
That's beef stroganoff.
And the gravy is so savory.
- It is really.
I swear the fast food
gravy tastes delicious.
- Holy cow.
(utensils clinking)
(clapping)
Look at you.
You finished your whole burger by eating.
- I'm hungry.
- Oh my God.
Look at him, he's finishing his meal.
- I'm growing up.
- When I was in my daycare as a child
if you've finished your lunch,
you got to have a piece of candy.
However much food you
took you had to consume
and your reward, more food.
It was a good incentive for me.
What's going on with you?
We got some Lewberger digital shows.
I don't know when this
episode's coming up,
but we're probably doing
a virtual show sometime
in the next month or so.
- Come listen to new albums.
Yeah, that's when you should do.
Get over and listen
- Wouldn't it be cool if
all of the Philippines
shows Lewberger is their favorite band.
- why not?
- Then we could say things like
I'm huge in the Philippines.
- We would love to be able to do that.
- I mean, technically I'm a giant person.
I probably would be
huge in the Philippines.
- Oh, I see what you did there.
- Thanks for dropping by.
Thanks for the cookie brownies.
We'll see you next time on Eat the Menu
- Bye.
(humming)
- Next, you can't believe
it, I can't believe it
There is a fried chicken place
that I have not had before
and it's Jollibee.
I have actually specifically
not had Jollibee
because I always wanted to
try it for an Eat the Menu.
I wanted to try it for
the first time on camera.
I know that the chicken is marinated
and then it is breaded and fried.
So I'm looking forward to
what flavors lie within.
I also love that they call it chickenjoy.
But to help me get through both buckets,
please welcome to the Eat the Menu stage,
the one, the only Hughie Stone Fish
(humming)
Whoa, nice dude.
- Hey Keith?
- How's it going Hughie?
- Well, I'm back with no beard.
- [Keith] Isn't that crazy,
it looks totally different.
- Same me, longer hair, shorter beard.
- You took it away here,
you put it up there
like one continuous string.
Anyway, we got some fried chicken here.
One of them is mild, one of them is spicy.
I don't know which is which.
Oh, now I do.
Guys, hold on.
How do you know which one's
mild which one's spicy?
Well, the spicy one
has little flags in it.
Little flag says spicy.
Okay, we're gonna start with a mild one
then work our way up to spicy.
The chickenjoy.
(upbeat music)
Well, oh my this is a pie.
It really looks like....
No it's not, what is there?
It looks like white meat
but that's it's thigh bone.
- Really glistening.
- Very fatty.
- Very fatty.
- But it's good.
It has a good flavor even though
it's just very like simple
Nothing about it is so
strong that I'm like,
Oh, this tastes like this.
Let's go for the leg.
Way better.
- That's a little better.
- Whoa, night and day.
- I've tried a good bite.
- Yeah, I had my first bite was delicious,
like I was having a Fiesta.
- Talking about this.
Really did me wrong but I'm loving this.
- The spicy chickenjoy.
- I'm going back to this thing.
Look at how cute this is.
- This leg-foot,
this thigh-breast what is
going on with that piece.
I've never seen a piece quite that shape.
- It's like this little jolly
bee conquered this leg thigh
and stamped it spicy thing on it
- I declare this chicken in the name
of the spice bee, jolly bee.
(mouth crunching)
- It's a creeping heat.
It's the batter that has
the spice not the meat.
It's very on the tongue.
Like my whole tongue is covered
in a very prickly pepper spice.
Definitely has a little bit more flavor.
- Oh, you could see it on the inside too.
Some of that orange spice
is goodness for you.
- This is a good spice compromise.
A spice compromise as we say in the biz.
It does seem like they only
serve these thigh breasts
and legs in the bucket.
It's like a only a dark meat bucket.
There's no wings in here.
Oh, you know what Hughie?
We got to try it with a gravy.
The chickenjoy with gravy.
- The chickenjoy with gravy.
(lips tapping)
- You know it actually
doesn't go together as much
as much as I thought with the spicy.
- As our time is wrapping up,
I wanna just make the most of it.
Thank you, Jollibee.
Thank you, Keith.
- You're welcome.
- Thank you you.
- I'm finally happy to see
Hughie has a little chicken joy.
- I have hanging with my friends joy.
- All right, Hughie thanks for joining us.
We'll see you next time.
Anything you wanna plug on your way out.
- There's a new music project
coming up called "The Deli"
and I'm starting a nonprofit
to bring fully funded
transformative arts programs
to students in the city of Syracuse.
- I love that, nice.
You're spreading a little Hughie joy.
- Bye.
- Bye.
I'm interrupting this Eat
the Menu to let you know
my comedy again Lewberger's
first ever comedy special
is coming out February 9th.
So soon you can pre-order it on iTunes
and check the link in the
description for more information.
But it's something we worked
really hard on for a long time.
We're really proud of it and
it would mean a ton to me.
if you would check it out.
Okay, back to the video.
My mouth is hot, my mouth so hot.
My mouth is hot, my mouth so hot, yeah.
Q-U-E-N-C-H-E-R, Quencher.
Oh
(laughing)
I just pushed my beard through my head.
It's better.
What do you think about my hair audience?
Sometimes it doesn't look the best.
I can't do anything about it.
And then I watched back
the video when it's online
and I think man, I should
have fixed my hair?
And I'm embarrassed but I
can't do anything about it.
I'm getting a haircut tomorrow.
Oh yeah, you'll see my
new hair on our breakfast.
So yeah, real quick.
Obviously you saw that breakfast bar,
We shot that a different day
and now I don't have my haircut.
I don't know how this is gonna edit
It's all out of order but
that's part of the fun
of Eat the Menu baby.
Oh, I feel it.
I felt that was sticking up
weird, it's the back too.
Let's try the quenchers, get quenched.
The pineapple quencher.
(upbeat music)
Sweet, really good.
There's so much sugar in
this pineapple quencher
that like the pineapple.
I know normally pineapple
has a little bit of acidity
that like just lightly tickle burns,
I get none of that.
That's sweet and lovely.
Refreshing as a Coca Cola,
but nothing like a Coca-Cola.
Now, the mango pineapple quencher.
Get quenched
Oh, also really good.
This is like playground juice right here.
You give this to five year olds,
they can live for 16 days without sleep.
It's good though.
Can you look up the grams of sugar?
Is that something we can find out?
This is (beep) sweet y'all.
[Interviewer] There's
no nutritional facts.
- No nutritional facts, nice work.
Keep it as secret Jollibee.
No wonder these bees
(beep) got that smile.
Look at this guy's smile.
He's looking back down on his quencher.
(laughing)
Also I heard some people wanna know
like how much the items
cost on Eat the Menu.
I'm like that's a great question.
But of course you know
when I order the menu,
I don't necessarily order the combo meal
of every single item.
I'm not gonna order whatever
the highest possible cost is,
but I guess we can start throwing in
how much we paid I guess.
If you guys wanna know that, let me know.
If enough people comment that
they wanna know the prices
for how much we spend
on this, we'll do it.
Until then just look it up.
I feel so properly quenched.
I think now it's time to move
on to the chicken sandwiches.
Now, joining me for the chicken sandwiches
is 2nd Try's very own father, Ned Fulmer.
(humming)
- I did think that I was
gonna be just waist up today
so I wore my gym shorts.
- You look good.
- I didn't expect this
and I'm very embarrassed.
- No, when you eat fried
chicken, you should feel cozy.
- I just have the ability
to work out after this.
It doesn't say I'm going to,
I just like it's like athleisure.
- At any point a workout might happen.
- At any point today.
- See we're working out right now.
- We're working it out.
- Can we start this with
a little gravy soup.
- Yeah, dude.
I think the gravy is really good.
Let's try the gravy again.
- Oh yeah.
- It's good right.
- I would just have a little
side sip right there all day.
- I've been telling you.
- It's like Thanksgiving in my...
Oh my voice just went
several octaves lower.
- It's heavy, it's good.
There's a lot of salt.
The chicken dippers with rice.
The gravy is so good.
- [Ned] It looks a lot
crispier than it is.
- It looks a lot like the
Popeye's chicken chips actually.
They have a very similar sort of thin look
and it's got a nice crumble on the outside
that makes you think
it's gonna be crunchy.
- Yeah, it looks like I'm
gonna take a big old honking
crisper bite but it's really not.
- I can taste the marinade in this,
whereas I wasn't sure if
I could always taste it
in the bone in fried chicken.
But this meat tastes like
it has a specific flavor.
It's very tender.
- It's like, it doesn't need the gravy.
But if I had slathered in
it, it's that much better.
I would just dump it like
straight in this gravy.
- Oh, I think you're on to something.
- Had sink me.
- It did fit in a little soup.
- Sink me like the titanic you bitch.
Call me Steve Jobs 'cause
I'm innovating right now.
- Wow.
- Wow.
Oh, mama.
- Here we go.
Let's try the classic chicken sandwich.
(upbeat music)
- Whoa.
- Whoa.
- It's no Popeye's fried chicken sandwich
but it is definitely worth
putting it's hat in the ring
as the second and third best.
This is really good and the chicken.
- This has a big old slap
in the face full of garlic.
- Look at how moist this is.
- You know how they have some
cereals it's like Berry blast.
- This is a blast
- It's garlic gusher.
- Get in that gravy.
- It's the gravy.
- Dude the gravy is good.
Now, this is the chicken deluxe sandwich.
All that's changed is we made it deluxe.
The classic American way
of adding some tomatoes
some lettuce and some mayo.
(upbeat music)
Something is odd.
That's not mayo.
- I don't know, man.
This one's a little underwhelming.
I don't think there's
anything deluxe about this.
- What is this sauce.
I'm gonna see if the
gravy offsets the garlic.
- yeah, I don't know, man.
The lettuce is a little bitter.
I was happier with just the plain
like chicken bread garlic blast.
- Yeah, the vegetables
weren't fresh enough
to add anything good to the sandwich.
I think stick with the
classic chicken sandwich.
The deluxe was not
deluxe, it was de-minus.
- Got 'em.
- But Ned, things are
going great with you.
We've got the Baby Steps podcast.
It's still crushing and check it out
wherever podcasts exists.
You already know that it
followed their entire trajectory
through the pregnancy,
but now the baby's here
and there's more things
to figure out and understand.
- It's wild, we have two
young boys running around,
but it's all their funny
stories from what that is like.
All right kids, see you later.
- All right see you later, Ned
and take away that little
the gravy bucket with you.
- Thank you, I will.
- Sail away on the gravy boat.
Now, joining me to have
some yummy yumburgers
from Tailgate Debate
please welcome Marissa.
(ululating)
(humming)
Let me just stand up your chair.
- Thank you, hey.
- All right welcome.
- What's up.
- Marissa's here fresh
off receiving a negative COVID result.
Oh yeah, it's safe.
Whoa, it's delicious.
- Whoa.
- Whoa, look at that, who knew.
Who knew it was gonna
have that much goop on it.
This is just the plain yumburger,
but damn, it's got a lot of goop.
- What is this goop?
- I assume it's like a
thousand islands, right?
Because the Philippines are
like a thousand islands.
- That's good, that's good goop.
- All right, let's try the yumburger.
- Let's go.
(upbeat music)
That's good, I like that.
- The burger patty is the same burger
from that burger meal and
it's so heavily seasoned.
- Yes, it's good.
It's like a little sweet seasoned.
- It's sweet.
Why don't we flavor all burger like this,
what is the matter?
- There's literally nothing on this.
It's bread, patty and goop.
- The cheese yumburger.
(upbeat music)
yeah, the cheese did make a difference.
- It did.
- I was wrong.
- I was right.
- Not now.
I get why they call it yumburger.
- It's yum.
- It's yum.
- I need some water though.
- Well, you can't have any.
- I have the water bottle.
- You have to get really salty to hydrate
when you shoot this series.
I go home and I drink lots
of water and I don't pee,
I'm not kidding.
Now this suddenly like we
went from like little burger
to tall, impressive burger boy over here.
- I'm ready
- The amazing Aloha yumburger.
- We'll see if it's amazing.
- That's so many adjectives.
I love the fun.
The baby slice of pineapple,
the bacon, the bacon doesn't look good.
- No, that is so good.
- That is so good.
- Wow.
- Why is it so good.
- Holy cow, I hope it
really balances it well.
And I feel like I'm
having a specialty burger
like a Red Robin right now.
- Yeah I know, comment down below
if you'd like Keith to do--
- Red Robin.
- Eat the Menu of Red Robin
- I don't know,
I need to do something like an Outback.
I need to do another Olive
Garden level restaurant.
That's around the corner, sure of it.
The big yumburger.
- Oh that is a lot of goop.
(laughing)
All right.
- After the alarm.
It just tastes kind of like the
way a double quarter pounder
with cheese tastes too
much beef and cheese.
I'm not getting the balance that I need.
Okay, it's time for a hot dog.
It's time for a little hot dog.
- Love eating something...
(laughing)
It's the jolly hotdog.
It doesn't look good.
I don't wanna eat.
And no boy, did the cheese on the hot dog,
which leads me to believe
it's not served hot.
- Cross section.
- It looks like the spaghetti dogs.
- You go first.
(upbeat music)
- Go ahead.
Take a big bite, dive in.
Life is about experiences
even some are bad.
Some are bad, some are good.
It's intense.
We don't spit it out,
I'll just savor this up.
- You don't.
- You got to fight through it.
- Oh my God.
- What is in it.
- An under cooked hotdog with
miracle whip and sad cheese.
I'm sad that that's what we ended on.
Well, you know some things are joy,
Some things are jolly, some
things are just boring.
That's just the Jollibee way.
Marissa, what else are you working on?
I know you're in a lot of commercials.
You got some other cool
projects coming up.
Anything the audience could
look forward to seeing.
- Nothing I can talk about.
- Oh, mystery, well that's cool.
If you wanna see more of Marissa
and you haven't seen our
episode at Tailgate Debate
with breakfast burritos, check it out.
It's a super fun time.
Marissa, thanks for dropping by.
We'll see you next time.
- Okay, bye
- Bye, see you.
- See you, bye
- Bye internet.
- Follow Marissa on the internet.
She's got her Instagram just like you.
Guys, we made it we're here.
It's time now for our just desserts.
And at Jollibee they
only have two desserts
and they're both pretty signature desserts
for the Philippines.
The first we have the peach mango pie made
with real Philippine mangoes.
I don't know what's
different about their mangoes
but excited to eat 'em.
Look at this, doesn't it look good?
It smells really good.
It smells like French fries and fruit.
Let's just listen real quick.
(pie crunching)
Oh, do you hear those crystallizations.
Look how it is, bright
mango color in there.
(mouth crunching)
(sighing)
All right, accidentally
in that moment of biting
just fully swallowed a peach whole.
So slippery.
It's like it just walked down my throat.
I didn't swallow it,
it just gracefully slid through my body.
That's amazing.
I don't know if the mango is actually
a strong a flavor as the peach.
Maybe the Philippine mangoes
have more of a peach flavor.
It's really good.
(sighing)
(shouting)
And we also have the infamous halo-halo
or maybe it's pronounced halo halo,
or maybe it's halo halo.
- [Interviewer] It's halo halo.
- Halo halo
I was right the first time.
We put it in the freezer when we got home.
So it's kind of frozen over.
So I'm just gonna just
break it up a little bit.
Typically it would just
be broken up for you.
It's a bean.
It's a bean.
Okay, very cold.
So cold, I'm supposed to mix it up.
But it's so cute,
Why would they not just mix it up for me?
It's so cold, basically eating ice.
How am I supposed to
eat this (beep) thing?
Can I get a bowl?
I need to pour this out.
What the (beep) was green stuff in here?
Hold on, are these beans or jelly beans?
I think this was truly invented
when some kid walked down the desert bar
and put a scoop of
everything into their bowl.
Ice creams, jellos, flonase, jackfruit.
There's ice and beans.
I know your like yeah, Keith,
but they probably just like sweet beans.
Yeah, kinda.
They also kinda taste like beans.
I'm sure it's normal to
people who have had it
all their life but I haven't.
So to me it's a little weird.
So that's it.
We have tried everything from Jollibee.
So now you know what time it is?
It's time for the best and the least best.
All right, before I get to
the best and least best ,
I did just find out that
I guessed the halo-halo
is meant to represent
the diversity of cultures
in the Philippines.
So that's kind of cool.
Taking a little bit of everybody's desert
and that kind of explains what I said.
It was kind of like everything
on a dessert bar in one.
It was kind of a mishmash
of their various cultures
of desserts in one.
So I respect what it is.
I think it's cool.
That said, the underlying
flavor of sweetness, I liked it.
Let's think everybody, hello gravy.
I still get the gravy here the whole time.
And gravy's been a good friend.
This drink also really grew
on me as well, very sweet.
Let's start with the least best.
I think that the least best
without a doubt is the jolly hot dog.
The jolly hot dog fully made
one of our guests spit it out.
And I didn't like the hotdogs
in the spaghetti either.
I think the base hotdog
did not have enough flavor
of hotdog-ness
I think it just didn't work, didn't work.
Sorry, but it didn't work,
but really that's it.
And the other thing that weren't
good were just only fine.
It wasn't that they weren't good,
they were just only fine.
However, when it comes to the best,
the best of the day is
specifically the hamburger patty.
It was amazing in the burgers.
It was amazing under the gravy.
It was amazing by itself.
I mean, normally when you get those
basic kids burgers or cheeseburgers,
you get them because they're plain.
But these were not plain.
So flavorful, so amazing.
They had that thousand Island
type signature sauce on it
and also special shout out to the gravy.
Gravy itself, delicious.
Chicken sandwiches, pretty good.
The fried chicken also pretty good.
It's not gonna replace my obsession
with Popeye's but it was good
and I think if that's the
only fried chicken option,
you're not gonna be disappointed.
Jollibee overall, I think was really fun.
I think anytime you can,
you should try a restaurant that has food
you haven't tried before.
A great way to understand a people
is by eating their food.
And even the chain can tell
you a lot about their people.
I mean there's 1,150
Jollibees in the Philippines.
Safe to say, everybody
there has eaten there.
Just like everybody in America
has eaten in McDonalds.
It's just a part of our culture
and thanks for watching.
This has been great
thanks to all our guests.
Hughie, Ned, Alex, Marissa.
What a time, what a good time we had, huh?

Until next time, all
aboard the gravy train.
(upbeat music)
And I don't feel like dying.
That's a big plus.
I gotta say jolyburgers,
I thought I was gonna die.
Jokes aside, I was like what if I die?
What am I have a heart attack from this?
Should I stop doing this?
The answer is no, I shouldn't.
