i don't know if you can tell but it's raining 
outside so feels a little wet and cold today  
which is why i personally also feel 
a little low energy because of that  
but without a doubt i woke up today quite excited 
to discover more sb19 you guys have been sharing  
your comments and letting me know about the 
journey and i've just been learning about the  
talent that is sb19 and how they've basically 
taken p-pop to like the next level all of them  
are talented individuals and collectively they 
bring such prowess in their entertainment that  
it's actually really exciting to discover them 
and i can see why a lot of you have proclaimed 18  
which is why today before i go back and diversify 
the content on my channel again i want to check  
out mapa an official lyric video so not really 
a music video so i'm personally not even sure if  
today's reaction will have so much input from 
a editor's perspective but from what i know  
it's it's a ballad of sorts for mom and dad and 
someone who hasn't seen his parents for two years  
because of the pandemic my mom and dad live 
in malaysia i live in australia now i feel  
like this song is gonna hit a little hard but 
despite that i'm actually really excited to hear  
the vocals part of one of the reasons why i love 
boy bands is when they get raw and emotional and  
are able to bring their synergies into 
a piece of ballad and yeah okay enough  
of me rambling i'm gonna get straight into 
this reaction and if you want to connect in  
other ways i might instagram up here perhaps 
follow me there let's get on to this reaction
like nighttime songs your 
parents would sing to you
mama
m
a
i'm already feeling it oh i feel like this 
is a song i wanted to share with my mother  
oh okay their voices are so beautiful
someone who wrote the song has a moment
so passionate
oh it's so beautiful what's really cool as well 
like i i didn't think that i had anything to say  
from a video editor's perspective but like the 
symbology of using a boat that travels along  
on this map is just showing like this journey 
of life as you sort of grow up it's so simple  
but it has so much meaning even through a 
lyric video oh there's so much appreciation
okay okay that was a bit of a buzz kill my 
camera actually died i forgot to replace the  
battery before i started recording it's all 
fixed now let's get straight back into it
feels like a lullaby
foreign
so much hard to miss
of course
foreign
oh
oh wow oh their voices it's so powerful
oh i love that south east west mapaw
the symbology of that like your parents are the 
ones giving you direction for most of your life  
and when you do finally find the direction 
you're heading to like this song there's so  
much appreciation i was wrong to start when i said 
someone who wrote this maybe had their mom passed  
away um i think it's it's not even about that 
it's about the appreciation of them you know your  
parents putting in so much into your livelihood 
and then when you're older now and able to provide  
you give it back to them you give them the love 
and support that they've always given you and  
you give them time to just rest to just use the 
time for themselves i relate to so hard like it's  
as someone who lives in somewhat of a 
western civilization now here in australia  
you can sort of see the difference between the 
asian cultures and the western cultures and  
in the asian culture becomes a a very strong bond 
with family and appreciation for your parents and  
what they have provided for you and i don't know 
if that's because a lot of the asian people i know  
here are also of a migrant generation so you can 
sort of feel the struggle but wow i feel this song  
so much it's so beautiful the melody's just 
so easy to listen to and i miss my mom and  
dad i hope you enjoyed my reaction again sorry for 
that interruption halfway actually it's more i'm  
annoyed by it because i didn't get to experience 
this in one seamless take but nonetheless such  
a beautiful piece thanks for sharing this moment 
with me if you're new here and want to check out  
my other reactions to sb19 i'll link them right 
there and until next time i'll see you guys around
