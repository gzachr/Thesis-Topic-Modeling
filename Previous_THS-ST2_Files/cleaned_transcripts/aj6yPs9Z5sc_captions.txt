today let's go filipino chicken adobo
okay guys so let's start with the
chicken adobo by chopping up onions
and garlic let's start okay so we're
gonna start with the onions
in the meantime I'm already heating the
pan I have some lovely chicken here manok
 
I think almost any Filipino dish they
use onion and garlicwhat do you think is
it right I'm not chopping it very fine
just some slices of onion okay let's put
it aside so how much garlic do you use
when you make chicken adobo do you use a
lot not sure what is it a lot but let me
use a few cloves maybe four or five
okay so there's five cloves of garlic
lets chop up a little bit
okay so the pan is hot
let's put in some oil cooking oil
so let's start by adding the onion
sibuyas
let's put in the garlic there we go
I think it's time to add the chicken so
this yummy chicken here let's add it to
the pan
okay and then let's cover it let's have
a look let me just look at the chicken
turn
look at that color golden brown so the
heat is medium it's not so high
and I will add a little bit of water
and then cover again which kind of adobo
is your favorite
so is it like chicken is it pork, pusit or
just vegetables please let me know which
one is your favorite I would like to
know that I think personally chicken
Manok is my favorite okay so let's
have a look smells great
it takes some time before the chicken to gets
cooked
we need a little bit more patience PATIENCE! okay so this is gonna take some
time but we're already gonna add
ingredients other ingredients
this is suka or vinegar this white
vinegar I'm gonna add a bit actually
not so much and then also sugar
sugar
how do you say that in Tagalog I forgot
the word please help me out guys
or you just say sugar we also have soy sauce
of course but I'm gonna wait a little
while we put it putting that otherwise
it might start to burn let's have a look
again
very nice
I'm gonna flip over the chicken again
and then let's cover again so what is
still missing peppercorns perhaps or chili
I'm not putting any chili today but if
you have some optional ingredients that
you always use for your chicken adobo
please put in the comments so I'm adding
some peppercorns
also I might
grind a few
give it some spice
okay I think it's final step we're gonna
reduce the heat a little bit and then
it's time for adding the soy sauce
gonna flip it over again
and then cover it
maybe it needs about 15 more minutes or so
and then we're done
if you could just smell it guys it's
amazing it smells so good that's a plant
