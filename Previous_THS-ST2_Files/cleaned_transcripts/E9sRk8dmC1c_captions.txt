this looks amazing what the hell is that
this is giving fancy
oh wait i thought it was ice cream
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
so today we're going to try some ube
flavored foods and we're gonna be
ranking them according to buzzfeed's
historically scientifically proven
ranking system so there's super god
god
okay
ube is a purple yam that people often
confuse her with tara it's like a
vanilla
nutty flavor today what i'm looking for
in the foods is to see whether it tastes
like ube whether it tastes good and
whether the foods match ube i'm actually
the last snack
the only snack
oh my gosh these are my favorite
stop
so these are the junior stickers in the
ube flavor obviously these were like one
peso so like they would sell these at
like tinda like little like stores
maybe the smell is more like ube the
wafer is nice and like it's not too
sweet so it balances out with the sweet
orbit in the middle and it's so good
i'll give it an okay yeah obviously i'll
give this okay yeah i'd give it
a god i'm gonna give it
oh yeah the goldilocks goldilocks is
iconic oh it is goldilocks is a
restaurant in the philippines that sells
all sorts of filipino food and they're
pretty much famous for all of their
filipino classic dishes and they're very
sweet amazing treats i've been there
it's really cute it's like really
colorful and there's all these desserts
just lined up i thought my mouth is just
dry
but like this is the experience with
pulverian it's good though yeah like you
have that like sensation of like it
being dry and like sandy mmm boron is
very messy you just take a bite of it
and it just spills everywhere think of
hardened milk powder and then flavor it
uh because it's like a little like shaky
and dry i just give it an okay it's like
he's a 10 but it's dry yeah
so he's like okay
i would rank this as a god for myself
i'd probably rank anime
[Music]
okay so what we have here is our top oh
wait i thought it was ice cream
oh tap
what's happened this is what you were
talking about
it's a happy medium between sugar and a
biscuit this looks like a purple piece
of spam
oh my god that's so true
[Music]
crispy
it's good it's not as strong of an ube
flavor is is it good as a ube snack
probably not it's going to be a mess but
i'd give it a minute no
[Music]
have you tried this before i love mochi
but i've never had all your favorite
mochi i've never tried ube
she looks like a kidney
yours is a different color to mine it's
the same isn't it
mine's like
different shades
different shades of brown
oh it's really earthy it tastes like an
actual like uber root i'd give this one
a na
i'd give this one just because it's very
disappointing ube wise taste wise
okay and okay
[Music]
i like that it's cold it's like very
refreshing it's like cheesecake porpya
is like a moon cake
usually it's got like a thicker pastry
it's got that ice cream taste to it a
dry cold ice cream flavor yeah we'll go
like upper end okay yeah i'd probably
give it a god i'd also give this a go
it's really good
[Music]
they've got budget because they've given
them
you've got budgets
this one is really good
you know what i mean
are we on the same street you know what
i mean we're on manila street
like filipino dessert heaven if you
haven't tried any ube snacks or you have
a friend who hasn't tried them
give them this this one and it'll get
them onto it yeah 100
this is probably the one that's got the
most ube flavor
out of everything we've tried so far i'd
give this a heaven
just create another ranking
no i'll say super super god
super god i probably got god here yeah i
just do god here we go let's go to this
one this is good
oh cupcake
girl i grew up like eating these in
school it smells like cupcake
there's no coconut in the middle
i can't see anything yeah it's giving
false advertisement
but it tastes good these are one of the
things that like does the job
i'll probably go meh yeah man yeah
okay i'll give it a
minute the closest thing i would
describe it too is like fudge no i'm not
really getting the uber flavor with this
one
it tastes more like milk i feel like
this one was too
compressed it looks like a pesto
i think i would give this a nah nah i'll
give it a map
oh my god it's so beautiful
this looks amazing what the hell is that
this is giving fancy it's giving
molecular gastronomy it's like 500 at
your local cafe
oh my god can we just appreciate how
pretty this is
yeah
french toast covered with some sort of
crumb and then lemon food underneath so
it kind of cuts the
sweetness and then
um and then ube meringue that's been
toasted and icing sugar
wow
[Music]
[Laughter]
[Applause]
[Music]
supercard i would give it a super god
i'd give this a go i'll give this okay
don't kill me
[Music]
wow
this is good
this is more of like a subtle ube flavor
but it is very nice when this cream sort
of melts in your mouth
that's when you begin to taste the ube
i'd give this a god
i'm gonna give it a god because it's
stunnin it's beautiful
