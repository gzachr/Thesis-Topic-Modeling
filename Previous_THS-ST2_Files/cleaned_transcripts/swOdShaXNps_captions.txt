as many as 277 filipino gorilla forces
composed of more than 260 000 freedom
fighters in total
contested the japanese occupation of the
philippines during the second world war
some worked with the united states army
forces in the far east or
usa ffe while others worked alone or in
some cases
even against the americans by the way
without their bravery and sacrifice
it's likely operation musketeer in which
the allies returned to the philippines
to end japanese
occupation would have failed while we've
already discussed filipino gorillas in a
previous video
one daring assassin managed to evade all
of our spotlights
but we've seen her now and her story is
one that needs to be told
in this video we honor the brave female
filipino guerrilla leader
nieves fernandez
[Music]
before we delve into nervous story it's
worth establishing the stakes
just what drove her to set aside her
blackboard ruler and take up a knife
on the 8th of december 1941 less than
half a day after the bombing of pearl
harbor
the japanese began their invasion of the
philippine islands
over the next six months the filipino
and american forces defending the
philippines put up a solid fight
sustaining up to 146 000 casualties
but most were ultimately forced to
withdraw or surrender
it should come as no surprise to you
that the allied soldiers who fell into
japanese hands were treated horrendously
made to enjoy the infamous bataan death
march
just to name one atrocity but the
japanese did not reserve their cruelty
for allied soldiers alone
in many cases filipino civilians had it
worse
putting aside the infamous february 1945
manila massacre
in which one hundred thousand to five
hundred thousand filipinos were brutally
murdered by the japanese
hundreds of thousands of civilians
suffered and perished throughout the
three-year japanese occupation of the
philippines
many were wounded or killed sometimes
just for offering food or water to
marching allied pows
while others fell victim to famine
forced labor and torture
an unfortunate 30-ish filipino civilians
mostly of moral muslims also fell into
the hands of japanese medical officer
akira makino who conducted experiments
on them amputating limbs and dissecting
their abdomens
many women were victims of sexual
assault and more than 1
000 filipino women were taken as
so-called comfort women
and held in so-called comfort stations
like baha'i napola
or the red house where they were raped
on a daily basis
as per a new york times editorial from
the 6th of march
2007 these were not commercial brothels
force explicit and implicit was used in
recruiting these women
what went on inside was serial rape not
prostitution knowing that a similar fate
might have awaited them if they were
captured
this makes the heroic exploits of female
filipino resistance fighters
in particular all the more inspiring
despite the risks
some 26 000 female filipino gorillas
contested the japanese occupation of the
philippines
but only one woman commanded a guerrilla
force
of her own when the japanese first
invaded the philippines
it's unlikely that tacloban city-based
filipino school teacher
nieves fernandez knew how the war would
shape her life
when they started practicing untold
cruelty on
innocent civilians however her path
became clear
in nervus's own words when the japanese
came
no one could keep anything they took
everything they wanted
they had ways of persuading like giving
you scalding hot baths and freezing cold
baths alternatively
with never a rest never any food and
never any drinking water
except the soapy water in the baths but
she wasn't going to let the japanese
take
anything from her nor torture her
without a fight
nor was she going to let her students
get captured by the enemy
who would scarcely differentiate between
young girls and adults in their comfort
stations
miss fernandez set aside her ruler and
went out into the philippine province of
later
where she rallied as many as 110
filipinos
under one common goal to kill as many
japanese troops as possible
while also freeing as many women from
their inhuman assailants as possible
to those brave filipino gorillas she
wasn't miss
nervous fernandez but captain nieves
fernandez
guns however don't grow on trees so
captain universe's guerrillas were
forced to use
improvised weapons including
machete-like bolo knives
politics or tongs or homemade gas pipe
guns primarily shotguns loaded with
gunpowder and nails
and homemade grenades they also made
good use of captured japanese weapons
and the few american firearms they
otherwise acquired
fernandez was a born marksman but her
favorite way to dispatch japanese
soldiers was with stealth and
sharpened steel barefoot in a black
dress
she would sneak up on an unsuspecting
target and thrust her knife into the
soft spot
behind their earlobe opening their
carroted artery and internal jugular
she would then drive her blade deeper
piercing their brain
through which she would twist her blade
upwards making them
somehow involuntarily suck in air
of course while you're sucking in air
you're unable to scream
her victims scarcely made a peep as she
spilled their blood on the jungle floor
nieves taught this technique to all of
her gorillas and even demonstrated a
similar technique
at least it doesn't look to be the exact
same technique
on us army private lupiba in this epic
photo
taken on later island on the 7th of
november
1944. after two and a half years of
conducting
unconventional warfare behind enemy
lines fernandez had earned a reputation
among both filipinos and japanese so
much so that the japanese placed a 10
000 pesos bounty on her head despite
this
fernandez survived the occupation and
the war a single bullet scar
on her right forearm to show for it the
japanese however
lost more than 200 troops to this school
teacher gone rogue and her deadly
guerrillas
it's unclear how many rape and would-be
rape victims they were able to save
but it was likely many much of what we
know about nieves fernandez comes from a
single column published in the lewiston
daily sun
on the 3rd of november 1944 yet her
story is one of the most
incredible stories from the second world
war
her bravery is a testament to the
resilience of the philippines and
to an even greater extent filipino women
other filipino women fought against the
japanese occupation
albeit not always so directly some
served in medical roles tending to
wounded gorillas and escaped allied pows
while others established underground
intelligence networks and counteracted
japanese propaganda
and back to nearbest fernandez do you
know anything about her life which we
haven't covered in this video
perhaps if you're filipino you've heard
stories about her exploits which
wouldn't turn up in
online research also do you know of any
other brave
female filipino resistance fighters from
the second world war
