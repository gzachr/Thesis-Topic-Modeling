have you had filipino food like the food
eaten daily in the philippines i saw in
a fellow filipinas post that
filipino food popularized here in the
u.s are fiesta foods which makes sense i
don't remember having a lot of red meat
and fried food when we lived in the
philippines i remembered
a lot of vegetables fruit and fish
eggplant
bitter melon hong kong big fish small
fish
and a lot of mangoes and they were
typically bought fresh from the market
either same day or only a few days prior
even during the holidays i remembered my
grandma laying out a bunch of seafood
like
crabs and shrimps i don't remember a lot
of lump yeah
lichon and sisig it's like saying
american food is
only burgers wings and hot dogs i mean
it seems like it but
you know we got our avocado toasts too
