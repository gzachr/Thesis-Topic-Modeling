When I was still in elementary they already noticed
My movements were not lady like
Instead of Chinese garter, my toys were teks and marble
And I often jam with the tough guys in our neighborhood
When I was in high school, my friends were bisexual
I was curious girl that has a thing for girls
Instead of brining a make up kit, I always bring a guitar
My fashion sense back then was long sleeves T-shirt and faded jeans
But when I met you, I suddenly changed
I learned to rebond my hair and fix my eyebrow
I don't know what is in you that made me a girl again
Who would have thought, a guy like you would capture and amazing girl like me
Even if I am lesbian like
My heart would still beat for you
One kiss from you and I was changed
And my girliness would awaken
Like a flower that is newly bloomed
Because you showered
And exposed me in the sunrays of your love everyday
That made my life complete
When we were in college that was only when
I accepted your confession of love which took 10 months of courting
Instead of bring me chocolates and typical courting
You wooed me with your poems and cheesy songs
That is why when I met you
You knew there was a miracle
I learned to wear stilletos and often times red dress
But it is not your aim to change me
There is no hard bread to your warm coffee like love
Even if I am lesbian like
My heart would still beat for you
One kiss form you and I was changed
And my girliness would awaken
Like a flower that is newly bloomed
Because you showered me
And exposed me in the sunrays of your love everyday
That made my life complete
