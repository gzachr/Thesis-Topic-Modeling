in front of me right now cat's out of
the bag guys
today susie and i will be trying balut
i can't believe i've tried this today
i'm
scared you're dating a filipino guy so
it's bound to happen one day
if you don't know what bullet is it is a
duck egg oh it's a duck
yeah it's duck i thought it's a chicken
it's a duck egg that has been cooked a
couple
days before it hatches when you open
this bad boy
you never know what you're gonna get you
might see a full
you know duck or a little bit of a duck
i don't know if i can't eat it i don't
eat it too
there's a lot of people likes this in
philippines yeah my dad likes it
i bought a couple of them and my dad is
gonna eat the rest of it
so today are you excited
no have you tried anything as exotic
as this no never really i mean i've
tried beef tongue
in japan that was pretty exotic to me
but it's heated and it doesn't have a
shape of tongue this has a shape
it's a baby inside smelly it's not like
a it smells like a normal egg
it's a pretty big egg i have a question
yeah how do they season it oh
they don't season it inside what yeah
there's a soup inside
it's from the boiler wait what you know
how there's like liquid
in the egg when you crack it oh you
gotta know what just liquid right it's
just the white egg part right i don't
know the whole chemistry of it but
maybe some of the boiling water goes in
the egg shell so what i know bala is
like
oh you know you don't have to eat uh
meat
but you can just drink the soup and i
felt like they're gonna add like
seasoned soup
in the egg no no you basically just
crack this bad boy and sprinkle some
salt and you're good
i don't know before we crack a second
let me get some paper towels all right
back with our paper towels because i
know it's gonna get messy here to help
with our meal today i got some himalayan
pink salt
fresh from the mountains of the
himalayas
that's hard so we're gonna go ahead and
crack this bad boy
oh my gosh hopefully i'm scared
damn this thing is hard oh there you go
oh my god it's coming it cracked
i'm scared well what the heck it's a
boiled egg
maybe i boiled it too much this is your
usual egg oh there we go there we go
is that a veins oh i can see
don't feathers i don't know if you guys
can see the little things over there
it's feathers
i kind of don't want to unravel this
because you might see something very
weird there
so here's what it looks like guys pretty
freaking cool what we're gonna do now
is put some salt on it and try it you
ready i'm just scared
that if i bite into it there's like a
hand looking at me
i don't think so saying that how dare
you i mean
you like eggs so what's the difference
all right suzu do the honors oh my god
but there's a little baby in there
i don't know close your eyes
and take a bite no no no no no i don't
know
i don't know come on you can do it where
is it really apart
[Music]
but there are so many veins i don't know
if i can
i don't know if i can ever eat eggs from
now on it kind of looks like avocado for
the group
the green part it looks like avocado
thank you so much you'll sacrifice
yourself
itadakimasu i don't want to eat it
wait just before i bite into it how does
it taste like it tastes like an egg
are you sure yes are you sure everyone
does it tastes like eggs
my my hands is literally cutting off
circulation from how hard she's gripping
me
[Music]

[Music]
i don't know oh it's like a lover
i think i overcooked it
not eating this

[Music]
it was salty too oh
no disrespect to the philippines or
anybody who enjoys bullet it's just not
our thing
uh i can't i don't i don't know i don't
know why it can't this one was very
chewy it was very tough it's like
rubbery kind of right
it tastes a lot different from just the
egg it's
insane i thought you liked it or
something no no no no
that's one of the first times i've
actually experienced something like that
where
the moment you bite into it you just
kind of like want to reject it oh but
