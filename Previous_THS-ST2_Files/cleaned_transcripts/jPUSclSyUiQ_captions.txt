last time on delightful Travelers we checked 
out bantayan Island here in the Philippines this  
island was the definition of pure paradise and 
we know we'll be back in this video we've made  
our way over to behold and we're starting to think 
we made a huge mistake I'm Trevor and this is Anna  
in this series we're back in the Philippines

so you don't miss a single video a huge thanks  
to our channel members and patrons for making 
these videos possible welcome to behold [Music]
I'm on my way welcome back to another video here 
in the beautiful Philippines take a look at what  
is behind us we are in behold officially we are 
in Panglao and wow we are this place is absolutely  
stunning and you're gonna be a little confused 
about this but we'll explain throughout the video  
the First Things We Said to ourselves when we 
got here was did we make a mistake so something  
that we seriously struggle with as we travel 
especially as we get older is getting to a place  
and just wanting to see and do everything but 
we are full-time Travelers and honestly you just  
can't do that especially as I said we are aging 
and we want to do things a little bit slower we  
definitely now prefer slow travel and being in one 
place for a longer time and really like developing  
a relationship with that area and really finding 
everything out about it rather than just jumping  
around all the time because that really really 
does lead to burnout so in case you didn't know  
the Philippines has so much to do it's known for 
island hopping it's known for beautiful land keeps  
beautiful waterfalls but we're already wondering 
did we over commit ourselves while we're here for  
the entire month but just look at this beach like 
seriously look at the feet some of the whitest  
sand doesn't really get much whiter than this in 
the water the color of the water is absolutely  
stunning it almost doesn't look real it's got like 
this shiny effect on it which is so amazing so we  
just got here and we thought maybe we should have 
stayed here just here the entire month and use it  
as our home base we have to have a really great 
accommodation which we're going to show you later  
it's a full apartment so it would have been a 
great place to like settle in we are staying  
for a couple of weeks so at least we get to rest a 
little bit but in the next couple of months we're  
going to be jumping around a whole lot with you 
see coming up soon in videos but yeah for now it's  
like hmm maybe we should should have just stayed 
here also I just have to point out that there's  
like nobody here you guys a few people off in the 
distance this way it's empty too what is going  
on I know there's a so this is Dumaluan Beach I 
think it's called it's just a little bit outside  
of Alona which is kind of the popular area and I'm 
not sure this video maybe in this video we'll head  
into town later or in the next video but you'll 
definitely get to see it it's way busier there  
I can't believe well I'm glad everyone's not on 
this beach but I can't believe they're not it's  
so stunning so if you're new around here we have 
been focusing on this slow travel thing we're big  
fans of that as of late and in the future going 
forward I think we're going to try to pick between  
like three or four places per year and stay for 
multiple months we think that might be the plan  
for us however sometimes we do still do this where 
we're kind of hopping between those countries  
a little bit more quickly in the Philippines is 
already one of those countries that we're saying  
did we make a mistake we're already wishing that 
we were staying longer and in one place I mean  
this so far right here in pangolo seems perfect 
there's lots to do off of the island as well so  
we're kind of hoping like damn we should have 
rented a place for one month use this as a base  
and just went on adventures from there if you 
guys are enjoying the videos make sure to hit  
the like button because that just helps us out it 
gets the video out there and you should probably  
follow us on Instagram because if you were you 
would already know that we are here we usually  
post stories and you always get kind of like 
a sneak peek on where we're at all right it is  
time I'm not sure why it's taken us so long to do 
the good old-fashioned water test how is it uh I'm  
not gonna say it's cold because it's definitely 
not cold but it's more refreshing than I thought  
some of the beaches we've been to recently have 
been basically like bath water this is still warm  
but not hot yeah I think I could put it on a hot 
day it'll like cool you off it'll do the trick  
yeah it looks like you can do some kayaking here 
this is a stand-up paddle board and there's this  
really cool uh hammock back here as well let's 
check this out well I know where I'm gonna have  
is this you guys something so tropical feeling 
about a hammock over the water it doesn't get  
better yeah especially this kind of water is 
this the most turquoise water we've ever seen  
we're debating it uh I don't think I think it's up 
there but I don't think it is Trevor immediately  
got here and said this is the most amazing water 
I've ever seen in my life I think it's up there  
so a lot of the times when we come to Crazy 
beaches like this we will just like bring our  
towels down and kind of set up drop for the day 
but we do actually prefer to have loungers and  
some facilities maybe somewhere to get lunch a 
couple people actually recommended this place  
right over here we set up shop for the day I think 
it's called South Palms Resort so you can come and  
like use their Beach facilities have lunch have 
some drinks I think they might have happy hour  
as well they did tell us if you want to use all 
of the facilities including the pool everything  
is like 500 pesos per person I think they said 
but it's great for us just to come down on the  
beach and have somewhere to somewhere to lay 
out we've been talking about this off camera  
and we're starting to wonder like is this is this 
burnout is that why we're feeling like this are we  
burnt out we never really had that happen before 
and some people might wonder what what exactly  
do you mean by burnout so think about have you 
ever been on like a two or three week trip like  
maybe one of the longer vacations you've ever 
been on but you're traveling say through Europe  
or something and you're doing stuff every single 
day and by the two or three week Mark by your last  
day you're just like I can't do it anymore I'm so 
tired no interest in seeing anything more and you  
know you want to but you're just not feeling it 
basically it comes down to that like we're always  
filming editing we have other work we do so we're 
not on vacation we do work all the time that's  
the thing if you're new here you're probably like 
what on Earth are they talking about this is not  
our vacation we've been on the road now for about 
10 months and we just work a lot so we're starting  
to wonder like maybe we are burnt out goes back 
to why we like staying in places long because we  
can usually have time to relax a little more and 
properly rest which I think we need to do yeah and  
we have to accept the fact that we just can't do 
everything and we put these videos on everyone's  
like I can't believe you were in this country and 
you didn't do this and you didn't do that we just  
have to accept it like that's the way it is we'll 
always come back to most places that we love we  
still hopefully have loads of Our Lives left the 
problem is the problem is with us is like I guess  
you can call us Workaholics and we're just not 
wired that way to kind of like completely shut  
off we just always want to go kind of above and 
beyond and that's just how it is but we need to  
learn how to do the opposite yeah and that's why 
we'd like to stay here longer in the Philippines  
in gorgeous places like this all right well 
Welcome to our front row seats here how adorable  
are these I know we totally locked out we actually 
came I would say relatively late like I thought we
were beanbag chairs and uh that's the view 
for the afternoon I'll take it it's fun  
it's fun literally spent like 
the last four or five months
a month maybe one hand the number of days that 
we've spent like doing a date like this it just  
hasn't happened I don't know why like back in 
when we first got to Thailand we just had horrible  
weather so it was impossible to plan anything and 
when the weather got better I just feel like we  
were too busy or we weren't in the right locations 
to have Beach days like this so I'm so glad it's  
finally happening here in the Philippines like it 
is the ultimate Beach destination and here we are  
having the perfect Beach day we did in the last 
video too we were in uh bantayan on the an island  
another Island around Cebu but it was a little 
more laid back a little bit more like it wasn't  
much there we just kind of set up shop in the sand 
here we get to like I don't do a little bit and go  
get a drink and have some lunch this is perfect 
so we have ordered some lunch and it has arrived  
I must say this is one of the prettiest lunches 
I've ever seen it almost feels like we shouldn't  
eat off the plate because it's just so nicely 
presented but yes I'm gonna eat just a word of  
warning we did not order Filipino food today 
they had a really really wide menu here then  
a couple of Filipino no dishes but they were 
really big there was like a soup that I kind  
of wanted to try but it doesn't really seem 
like beach food so I'll have to do that in a  
future video but I went for some grilled cheese 
comes with some chips and then Trevor got some  
fish wraps let's try this beautiful grilled 
cheese there is a uh red chili on the top I  
might skip that one but there is a also jalapeno 
and a tomato beautiful beautiful grilled cheese
I honestly couldn't even tell you 
what the cheese is in there it  
might be Brie or something something 
really really creamy not too punchy  
but that is where I really like the jalapeno on 
the top because it adds a little bit of a kick  
to it I also might have noticed the price I think 
something that I've noticed around here on some of  
the menus anytime there seems to be imported 
cheese things need to be really expensive so  
I'm guessing just cheese getting it coming from 
abroad it's probably really expensive check out  
these little fish wraps I got there's actually 
like five of them so that's kind of fun I don't  
even see the fish inside but I'll just try it 
out I can't tell exactly what's on this yet
oh there's like a curry in there mmm take a look 
at the inside here there's like some cheese the  
fish is really good it's like a white fish don't 
know what kind but someone can let us know because  
I'm sure there's lots of white fish around here 
given the oceans right there the wrap is good as  
well it does have a little bit of that Sweetness 
in it the Philippines we mentioned I think in a  
previous video that they like come sweet bread 
and even in this wrap I taste like a bit of sugar  
it's never my favorite thing so I'm not a big fan 
of the sweet Filipino bread but it is still good  
the curry rounds it out but something we wanted to 
talk about here in this area especially that we're  
digging about this area because it kind of has 
everything there's Resorts like this like fancy  
resorts for any type of vacationer there's also 
lots of locals around and really authentic places  
to eat it has a bit of everything there's also a 
lot of digital Nomads here so that's interesting  
didn't expect that and that of course means the 
internet is really really fast we are big fans  
of fast internet because we can put out these 
videos and upload them faster so we're gonna  
finish up our lunch here and then take you guys 
to our place we're staying in a really cool spot  
we know you guys like when we show you so you're 
about to see it now Welcome to our place everyone  
we are staying at a place called Isla Homestay and 
as you can see it's absolutely beautiful this pool  
yeah this pool is one of the main attractions here 
we really like it so we're about I'd say about 10  
minutes uh driving from where we just were so it's 
nice and Central and then where we're taking you  
very soon is another 10 minutes into Alona which 
is like kind of the main area where you go here  
there's another Beach but a lot of people go 
for Sunset the restaurants are there we're also  
staying just over here and we're gonna take you 
take you through it because it's a great little  
spot we have a great little table here and it's 
just off the pool in the background a little line  
here to hang your clothes from being at the beach 
and you can walk through the door here there's a  
patio door with a screen for bugs this is awesome 
but uh yeah main door is right here see if anyone  
is home hello who is it it's you welcome inside 
I'm going to give you a quick little tour honestly  
has been absolutely perfect for us another reason 
we've been questioning if we should have stayed  
here longer this place is absolutely awesome so 
we got a full table over here which is great for a  
eating a meal or we are editing Suite as we always 
take over the tables and turn them into deaths and  
then you have a full kitchen over this way a water 
cooler which is great I don't know if we've seen  
any like in Southeast Asia at all normally like 
on the other side of the world you see them it's  
really in the Caribbean and everywhere you can't 
see them a lot but not really over here full-size  
fridge there's a burner a gas cooktop but no oven 
but that's pretty common as well lots of little  
appliances as well the living room is this way 
we have a nice couch there's the patio where you  
just saw and then we have a TV set up which is 
great because we're watching shows again we are  
watching shows again it's so funny we can spend 
like 10 nights in a hotel like we did that in  
Bangkok recently and we don't watch shows there 
but when we get into actual like setup with a  
sofa and everything we're like okay let's relax 
and watch shows just makes it nicer being in an  
apartment it's a big storage closet over here so 
if you were living here or staying a long time  
there's lots of storms in here you can do the 
bedroom first it's a good size yeah it has its  
own AC in here and also a huge closet over here 
as well yeah the bed is actually pretty comfy and  
the last part is the bathroom so bathroom here of 
course you have your toilet nice vanity and yeah  
nice tile work on the wall with a walk-in shower 
of course if you are wondering the internet here  
is really really good I know a lot of people 
get really concerned about the internet in  
the Philippines because you just hear really bad 
things and also when you start doing research when  
you are trying to find accommodations I feel like 
all the reviews I always read are always terrible  
terrible internet and I get really frustrated 
I can confirm that this place has really really  
really really really good internet and we've had 
no issues doing any work we can watch Netflix and  
everything so if you're interested in Booking 
this place we'll put a link as always in the  
description it's just below the video you can book 
it for yourself so the only drawback is that we  
are quite a bit away from Alona the Lona Beach 
that's where most people tend to stay there's  
a lot of resorts and hotels there but I do have a 
Tuk Tuk so maybe we'll hop in that now and head in
[Music]
yeah this is our red little uh tuck tuck 
and it's just pain that's Ken you want to  
say hi Ken to the block hey Ken's the best he's 
been our he's been picking this up everywhere  
oh yeah sorry just give him the money so five ten 
minutes later we are here this used to be kind of  
like the main intersection in town one way goes 
down to the beach and you will notice that right  
beside each other you have McDonald's and Jollibee 
I know that's the weirdest part huh like right  
beside each other there's local places everywhere 
and then you've got McDonald's and Jollibee do  
you think they need it purposely like sets up 
side by side yes so as soon as you get off that  
busy uh Street back there you're on this street 
which is way more quiet there's still some action  
happening around but this is the street that leads 
to the beach there's lots of food around like for  
instance here you can see all this like seafood 
fresh seafood we're not into Seafood so that's  
not our thing but if that's your jam you can 
absolutely do that but yeah then there's also like  
bars around so you can see that so it's pretty 
cool Filipinos love love seeing the Vlog camera a  
lot of people as soon as we turn it on I guarantee 
the minute we stop filming they're gonna come over  
and say say hello but yeah you can see again look 
we're just walking no edits right now and yeah  
more fresh look at all the food like fresh seafood 
very colorful very bad I know Bluefish over there  
so this is Alona Beach we haven't actually been 
here during the day but I'm assuming it's pretty  
busy because at night especially in the early 
evening and getting into the night it gets  
really really packed down here I think everybody 
in the area just kind of congregates here you can  
see why there's like all these bars the beach 
stuff maybe not as beautiful as when we were on  
earlier but it's really really nice this beach is 
a Perfect combo of restaurants cafes and bars and  
well this beautiful beach here's the thing right 
now there is tons of clouds in the sky and the  
beach still looks like this at about 5 30 p.m so 
we came down this lake so we're trying to catch a  
sunset but the thing is and then the sunsets are 
popular to catch here but the thing is with all  
these clouds I don't know if we're going to get 
the sunset we saw one here the other night and it  
was out of this world so we were like we gotta 
take you guys to see it so keep your fingers  
crossed stay tuned we might get a sunset tonight 
sometimes the clouds make for a better Sunset  
we'll see well take a look at this it's like a 
little massage area no thank you this is cool
I don't know if I've ever seen like a designated 
massage yeah this is cool this is really neat  
yeah this is the first definitely well I guess 
we'll keep going this way see what's over here  
one of the things about this beach is a it's 
really long and uh it keeps surprising us like  
we're just walking around now and this is 
like a nice resort huh it is there's so I  
think we kind of already alluded to this 
I talked about it a little bit already in  
this video but there's an interesting combo of 
like really big Resorts around here which is  
I don't really think about when I think about the 
Philippines Resorts because they're definitely  
here like five-star really fancy places not sure 
if this is one of them it's definitely big yeah  
I feel like it's a fancy one way up on the hill 
over there it's a cool setting sounds like a good  
combo but the thing maybe we just didn't know we 
do a lot of research when we travel but the thing  
that shocks us the most about this area like we 
thought coming to penguire would be really quiet  
and especially alone a beach and there's more 
people here than we've seen at other beaches  
like post you know lockdown time so it's just uh 
it's crazy great for the Philippines that people  
are coming back here yeah oh definitely I can't 
believe how many people are here well this might  
be the best Sunset we have ever seen look at the 
colors going on here it doesn't even make sense  
to me how beautiful this place is right now it's 
also a little bit later now you can see Things  
Come A Little More Alive at night and it's still 
really beautiful here but wow what a day this has  
been a lot of fun yeah this place is absolutely 
amazing I love that we're staying well I love  
don't like that we're staying outside of town 
because it can get a little crazy here yeah  
it's very very busy we didn't get it tonight but 
a few nights ago we were here and there was like  
a big fire show it gets pretty busy down here I 
think I have some b-roll of that so if I do and  
you might be seeing it now I have it on the screen 
so you'll see that but it's cool I know there's  
like beautiful beach like incredible beaches here 
nice places to stay I love where we're staying I  
wish we were a little bit closer but it's still 
it's all worked out and now we're we're really  
going like we should have just stayed here yeah 
so just stay here so that's the thing did we make  
a mistake I mean I think the mistake for us we 
told you how we like to travel if we could go  
back we probably would have based ourselves out of 
here like right here and use this as a jumping off  
place because it's really kind of our Jam but hey 
we learned we learned today live and learn if we  
come back to the Philippines that's probably 
what we were doing we will come back to the  
Philippines don't worry and speaking of Filipinos 
in the Philippines in general we noticed a lot of  
you guys have been asking or telling us like you 
know you need to go here you need to go there and  
some of you are new around here a lot of You Are 
so uh you just need to to know that we were here  
three years ago when the lockdown happened and 
we hit up some places we did so we started off  
in this was like March 2020 started off in Manila 
yeah and then we went to we flew to coron and did  
like island hopping and got to do all that flew 
to El Nido got to do a little bit of Iowa hobby  
but then we got locked down there for four months 
something like that flew back to Manila and now  
we're back and we're just doing the Cebu area so 
obviously we haven't seen the whole country but  
um for all of you guys saying like you know 
go to El Nido go to coron go to Manila we have  
seen quite a bit of it and on this trip uh we're 
seeing more of the Cebu region and a future trip  
I'm sure we'll come back into totally different 
areas yeah so if you are new here Trevor Anna
