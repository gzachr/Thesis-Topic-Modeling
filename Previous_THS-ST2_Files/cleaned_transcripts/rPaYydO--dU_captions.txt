filipino food
and i'm gonna bring it there
and
we will have a party
and this is our traditional filipino
gathering or party so you might notice
you will be culture shock
later on when i will have the
we will be there um
we will have
something in the table that you will be
shocked
we will have a whole roast pig in the
center of the table
that's how we celebrate any big
occasions in the philippines big and
joyous occasion
party christmas new year
anniversaries
birthdays anything
we always have this tradition of putting
a whole roost pig in the center of the
table so don't be
so negative don't be shocked that there
will be things like that later on
because that's how we filipinos
celebrate especially christmas christmas
is
a joyous celebration for us so
we put a lot of filipino food like this
one this is a very traditional filipino
food we always have this during any
occasion but december christmas party is
very special we will have a whole roast
pig you know i know you're muslim and
then you will comment me
why this and that is our tradition
it's a filipino tradition and my husband
i appreciate him and i
i really do because he let me do these
things he doesn't prevent me from doing
these things is called respect
you know i celebrate with them he
celebrates with me so
when you have respect with each other
your family will be good
so respect each other's culture and
tradition this is not about i am eating
this is
our
uh culture and tradition as a filipino
and
you see
there are only few filipinos here and we
seldom gather or be together so we make
it in a point that in a year we will do
a simple celebration so every year we
will make a christmas party so we are
going through to bangalore
