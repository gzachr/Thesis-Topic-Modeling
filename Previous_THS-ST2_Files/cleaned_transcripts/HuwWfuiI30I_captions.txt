i guess this is not going to be an 
official tourist tour which i prefer  
interesting to see that there's 
a whole community living here on  
stilt houses i'm getting welcomed here with 
100 plus with "pisang goreng" [Fried Banana]
all right welcome back to another video from kota 
kinabalu and today i'm trying to get to an island  
i am at the ocean frontier now and over there in 
the background there are some islands and i think  
you can hop on a boat here to go over to 
the island but i'm actually not sure what to  
let's ask hello hello from malaysia hello hello
and i would like to go to an island you 
want to violence is it possible can boat  
right here yeah oh that was easy hello hello 
hello my friend i love you i'm good thank you
let's see that was almost too easy
you're gonna see what's happened i just want to 
go over to one island actually if you want to go  
and i learned this morning this one is 35 ringgit 
that's not in the morning horrible now if you want  
to know you must uh one more character take one 
one character yeah 350 350 yes that's a little bit  
too much all right that was the option 250 ringgit 
for private boat right now yeah to get over the  
island and i think it's a five-minute boat ride 
to be honest so i'm not paying 250 for that but  
i'm not giving up that fast there must be some 
guy uh here with the boat who can bring me over  
for a fair price or maybe uh let's get a smoothie 
here to start with hello you have a mango avocado
three layer juice can i get three layer 
juice what three layers is it which fruit
avocado okay that sounds good one one yes please  
ah three layer juice i tried the famous 
three layer tea when i was in sarawak  
and looks like they have three layer juice 
here as well which looks very delicious  
and then yeah where was i um yeah you can get 
over to the island by the way it's an island  
over there that i'm talking about which literally 
it's probably less than five minute boat ride  
and yeah he offered me a to join a tour group for 
35 ringgit in the morning but i'm not really keen  
for this typical tourist tour group boat ride 
you know probably they drop you off at the beach  
then you can chill there for half an hour and 
then you go to the next beep something like this  
i want to go on an adventure which 
is not the typical tourist experience
she's making like three separate uh juices now 
the dragon fruit avocado and the mango one she  
uses three separate mixers and then she uh 
it's gonna make it together i guess i never  
saw that uh technique before like usually when 
you order food shakes and you order with two  
or three or four different fruits they 
mix it all together right like right away  
13 ringgit okay thirteen winged for 
a huge smoothie here is my casing
check it out that looks very 
interesting right three layer  
smoothie i never saw that before all right
delicious and yeah let's uh venture over to the 
pr see if maybe there's an uncle with a boat
is it possible to get a boat over there
not just to the islands
but they say 250 ringgit
can i get a ticket here no no so you can see 
there are a few of these small boats here  
and i'm wondering if it it's possible to 
talk to one of these boat guys here and  
ask him to bring me over for of 
course i'm going to pay these guys but  
yeah this offer over there 250 was just ridiculous 
so i can see several of these small boats here
let's see if i can find someone and try my 
luck village no i want to go to the island  
with your boat you have a boat here 
yeah this boat how much 100 100 island
and come back we go around how long
um
one hour one hour we go around and then we come 
back here and and can now now 100 okay okay  
okay so that was easy now we're making a 
tour now for one hour for 100 so less than  
half of the price than the guy over there i 
wait here okay we go big foot or small boat
like this small boat okay okay okay so it's 
not going to be a big boat like this i guess  
it's going to be a small boat like that over 
there so that's even a bigger adventure then
all right so yeah i'm actually more happy to 
pay these local guys here than the tourist  
companies over there who are asking for 
way overpriced price better to support  
these local guys here at the pier right 
he is coming with a small boat like this  
report here yes ah looks nice okay okay how do i 
go down here it's going to be the next question
okay
okay see thank you good luck i need luck dangerous 
oh he said yes i just jumped down here okay
all right
safety safety okay i am able 
to swim but uh let's get a rest
okay let me put it on okay what is your name
yes yes okay all right let's 
make the boat ride with mr harley
okay so we go around yes okay 
what is the name of the island
yeah we have several islands here if you remember 
my previous video where i filmed on the ocean  
front here we saw the islands from the from the 
oceanfront actually from right over there ah  
today the weather is okay it's not 
cloudy not raining ah i'm excited
uh boat right now it's fun the 
sun is shining it's not too hot  
today because it's cloudy you have a 
nice wind in your face ah i love it
i guess this is not gonna be an official tourist 
tour which i prefer so let's see uh which places  
uh he will bring us to i just realized that 
the water here is not really deep i can see  
the ground from here how many meters how many 
meters is it because i can see the ground
maybe five meters
i know i can't see the ground anymore 
but i could definitely see it over there
not really deep here right
oh yeah you can see the ground here
maybe two meter maybe maybe 
yeah maybe even less ah
oh one year one and a half meter oh it's 
very shallow fishing village village
i guess there's a little fishing village here 
you can see the houses here on the on the stilts
this is a mosque here i don't even 
have a mosque here in the water village
hello
friendlier kids here
are these uh malaysian people from malaysia 
people philippines from the philippines  
ah okay okay that was my guess because i 
heard that there are many filipinos living
malaysia ah okay okay so i think 
what he means is they have a  
malaysian ic card which is the 
national identity card as far as i know  
but they are from the philippines so actually 
an interesting story behind these villages i  
remember i saw the the video from my friend 
stephen ivana from the jet lag warrior channel  
from kota kinabalu the video that they made 
here and i remember many of the comments there  
we are telling that sava actually belongs to 
the philippines and that made me thinking like  
what's the story behind it why are there people 
in the comment section saying that sabah actually  
belongs to the philippines so i'm actually 
curious to learn more about that and yeah  
there are filipino people living here and also 
there's a filipino market over there so there  
seems to be a connection between saba and the 
philippines which i would like to know more about
yeah i guess what we are seeing now is not uh 
what typical tourist tour groups are seeing  
when they uh take one of these expensive boat 
rides interesting to see that there's a whole  
community living here on uh stilled houses on 
the island it's very interesting to see it hello
oh people you're very friendly 
many people smile and wave
your house you live here ah but you're not from 
the philippines you're from the philippines as  
well filipino you're true ah okay okay ah 
he's living here as well yes we can do it
hello
hello
hello
huh
uh
very good
that's so interesting here seeing 
this village here so many kids around
hello
oh i understand
actually i maybe i should just speak filipino here 
i think in the philippines you say thank you as  
salamat i think the only thing i can say so far 
in filipino language oh hello i can come inside
nice oh it looks beautiful here hello
oh that's a nice house here
all your children no no no no 
not all right hello hello hello
oh you have fish here yes can i see i can see
she's having some fish here ah you catch today
so this is your dinner your 
dinner woman later you eat okay
do you
that's your language okay so is it a 
mix between bahasa malaysia and filipino
okay malaysia speak you speak bahasa malaysia  
and filipino a little bit okay i 
see and understand i understand okay
germany yes i'm from germany
okay that looks really good 
okay thank you thank you
how do you say thank you here
how
oh thank you i had to hold 
everything let me get maybe
oh nice to meet you hello i'm 
getting welcomed here with 100
okay nice to meet you bye bye bye bye okay 
would like to show me another place now
it's amazing that everybody here is so 
friendly and welcoming wow i'm once again  
really surprised in a very positive way 
about the hospitality of the locals here
okay
maybe you can hold this
and he would like to show me another 
place now okay bye-bye bye-bye
ah thank you very much that was 
really nice to see thank you thank you  
what is your job here what do you work
for for tourists
passenger to an island okay okay but normally 
not here passenger to island here here  
not for the for the local people ah so i guess 
he's like a taxi driver for the for the village  
here kind of a boat taxi driver ah so every 
day you would drive around i see okay okay uh  
every day 100 100 100 ringgit 150 
how much uh the local people pay
if the people here people how much they pay
feeling it okay okay
so yeah he's making a living by uh bringing 
over people from here to the mainland and  
back here charging three 
ringgit per person normally
so we are here now at another part of the 
village which is on the other side of the  
island here on the other side of the 
main big village where we just have  
been your friends here yeah okay uncle 
okay let's have a look as well here
oh hello hello
hello
like a relaxing life here right by the ocean  
on a little house like this hello oh people 
play here yeah ah nice and they built new boat
so they also are building their own boats here i
guess maybe the local boat builder hey hello hello 
nice to meet you ah you built the boat here you  
built the boat yeah oh okay and then you sell the 
boat ten thousand winged for one boat here oh okay  
so if you wanna get a new boat here ten thousand 
ringgit so people build boats here and then  
probably sell it people catch fish and sell 
it to the market or people work as a taxi boat  
driver as mr ali does so that's how the people 
here make a living hello hello i'm from germany
hello
so this is the high school area 
here ah so this is elementary  
elementary school over there 
and another mosque over here  
so he just called this the school village but uh 
the students they live in the village yes okay  
and then every day they come here with the boat ah 
okay and that's also cool going to school by boat
ah this is classroom
what's inside here oh hello hello  
like a little tiger ah so this is a school here  
that is interesting to see it's afternoon 
already so the school is already closed
you also go to school here you also go to school 
here when you're younger no no you're school not  
here philippine yeah oh okay what age you come 
to malaysia 1998 1998 you come here ah okay well  
my school wasn't as cool as this right by the 
ocean on an island that's a cool school isn't it
right foreigners oh but you don't 
have matali students here don't you
speak english here
do this the students also they sleep here 
no no no sleeping just school okay okay  
i thought maybe this looks a little bit like like 
dorm rooms you know yeah over there are still  
many students so some students stay over there for 
maybe like after school activities or something  
like this because it's already afternoon 
so the official school time is already over  
but they are playing around there they all look 
so happy and enjoying the time i remember being  
a student in elementary school that was life was 
easy back then right wait wait three minutes three  
minutes your daughter come yeah okay okay 
are you take to the okay okay actually his  
are here as well and i guess we are going 
to pick them up now basically hello hello  
that's cool getting picked up from from school by 
your dad with a boat that's really cool isn't it
okay nice to meet you have a good 
day bye bye okay bye bye all right
oh that was a nice experience and yeah i gave him 
a little bit extra now because he was very kind  
showing me around even brought me to his house 
so i rather pay the local regular dudes here  
than uh buying an overpriced touristy 
tool over there and i'm very sure that  
this experience was much better than one of these 
typical tourist tours that you can do here i  
really really enjoy experiences like this 
where you get to know the local community  
the local people see how they live and yeah 
just get to know the locals you know and if  
you are curious to see my first impressions 
video from kota kinabalu then check out the  
video right here stay healthy stay positive 
and then see on the next episode ciao guys
