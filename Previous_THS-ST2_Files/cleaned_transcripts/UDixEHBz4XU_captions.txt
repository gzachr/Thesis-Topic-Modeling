able to get into the country with that
you gotta have that information i told
you beforehand you have to have an rtf

number one
uh philippine non-immigrant visas okay
there are several types of philippine
pieces there uh
it means you're not coming here to
immigrate what does it mean immigrate
like i don't know what that that big big
immigration that means that you decided
you don't want to live here you don't
want to transfer your company your
country from the usa or
russia to the philippines you don't want
to migrate here you don't want to
immigrate you want to just visit so this
is called the non-immigration pieces i
want to talk to you about are you moving
so far y'all with me may want to go get
you something cause it's going to be
some information this may be one of
those videos that you uh you hold back
and you keep bookmarking on your uh
desktop on your browser so that you can
look at it when you can you know when
you want to you feel right long strong
with me let's go all right so now i'm oh

let's go
so now
[Music]
issued to foreigners who are visiting
for a short period of time so it's a
short-term piece okay and uh who do not
qualify to become a permanent resident
visa now permanent resident visa will be
a long-term state visa so this is a
short-term tax day visa we're talking
about the philippines tourist visas the
philippines touring species to
foreigners who are entering the
philippines for recreational purposes
their philippines visas business visas
to foreigners who are entering the
philippines for business related
purposes
the philippine student visas florida's
who are in any country for educational
purposes this philippines visas for work
visas foreign country to work but i
don't know who would do that because
they don't pay a little a lot of money
in the philippines you can't live off of
pesos when you got uh dollar mentality
you won't want to get in trouble baby
you need some dollar bills baby make you
want to chill all right and then we're
going to talk about number 8 the
philippine tourist visa okay
i mean letter excuse me thank you sister
thank you
[Music]
sometimes they have several names for
these guys sometimes you'll hear them
say tourist visa sometimes you'll hear
them say the temporary visa sometimes tv
uh temporary tpv temporary permanent
attempted
tvp temporary visitors visas there's a
lot of names for this so keep in mind
they all mean the same thing that nine a
tourist visa that you have to get to
come to the philippines short term and
stay here it's all the same thing so if
you him say tourist visa it's really not
a visa it's just allowing you coming
fees for free for those you have from
visa free company countries such as
united states uh great bridge et cetera
et cetera they're allowing you to come
in they call it tv temporary business
visas tourist visa or permanent uh
temporary state visas those are those
some of the terminology or words that
this calls and sometimes many people get
confused by that those words so i want
to bring that up to your attention they
have different names for but it's the
same thing all right a philippine
tourist visa is a short-term visa which
is issued to visa required foreigners
okay who these uh visa required forms
will enter the philippines for tourism
medical treatment conducting business
attending cultural academic or sports
event visiting family members any other
short-term purpose which does not
require the holder to work that this is
the type of pc you have to apply for if
you do not intend to set up
permanent residence in the philippines
but will simply stay there for a short
period of time passport holders of
several countries are exempt from
holding a permanent philippines tourist
visa
while those who are needed can apply for
it and nbc accounts okay so uh
you you uh if some of you need the
tourist vc get in here this is what it's
called short-term terms yep but some
countries are exempted such as the
united states you have to apply for it
you just come here on your own okay but
keep in mind ladies and gentlemen i want
to bring this to you to your attention
if you are on a tourist visa okay
and for some crazy odd reason you decide
you want to get a job in the philippines
and you want to work for some pesos and
you get your job right
guess what you just violated your
reason because on a tourist visa you
cannot work okay and a lot of people
don't realize that and they come out
here violating the pieces and don't even
know you know so i'm gonna get away with
it because they don't check on everybody
they can check on every pastor that
comes here you know they just can't do
it so somehow sneak and get sneak
through the cracks you know shift
through that so but i'm telling you if
you're coming out here do not work now
what does it work does work mean work
online that that's not good
the only time it counts if you work
online
it does kind of work online
uh however if you have a 13 a permanent
visa such as i do you are allowed to
work on if you have a 98 visa temporary
short-term visa you are not even allowed
to work on like this work you're not
even allowed to work in a more a
building or a shop or whatever you know
you can't work on it on a nine a piece
i'm just telling you straight up some of
you guys will be logged out there they
know we're back he doesn't online

cannot work
in the philippines on a nine eight short
term permanent

all right now let's go next one next one
next one here we go
my sister's real slow don't know what to
do don't know what to do
okay
all right here we go all right so uh who
is eligible for a philippines visa okay
this is called an electronic travel
authorization so you know some people
some people are allowed to apply for
their thesis electronically
and the only citizens of taiwan are
eligible to receive an electronic travel
authorization for the philippines so
don't think that just because you're an
american you can get your eta electronic
problem for popularization you cannot
okay only taiwan is allowed to do that
do i need a transit visa for the
philippines
you do not need to have a visa to
transit in the philippines if it can be
good
you're connecting flight is within 24
hours
you will not leave the international
transport area of the airport
you will not switch terms
you have the necessary documents for the
third country
you are not a refugee or stateless
person
if you would switch between terminals
then you must have a philippines visa as
it will as an airport escort okay that
should be
escort okay
so the best thing to do ladies and
gentlemen when you come here do not go
ahead don't have any connecting flies
don't like going to different airport
different terminals try to keep it in
one keep it clean one simple shot when
you get here and you won't need any of
those transferred transit pieces that
well okay but for the most part you guys
won't need that but i want to bring it
to you so i can be thorough when i bring
this information out all right last one
next one we'll be out okay here we go
very more important information all
right long term stay visas okay just to
be good on this one
if you intend to stay in the philippines
beyond the time your visa exemption
allows
you then you must have the necessary
philippines visa so if you come to the
usa right i mean you come
to the philippines
i welcome sometimes you get tired of the
united states you get
a concrete jump and you want to go where
it's relaxed nice free people are happy
and the sun is found a lot of people
come out here for the winter in the usa
they'll come here for the winter because
it's always pleasant
some of these
highlights but it's always better than
the winner right it's better than snow
y'all be dealing without that but yeah
i'm so you may want to stay half a year
you know and then go back yep so uh
this is the type of information you need
to know and i'm trying to bring it to
you right technology all right so long
term state peace
if you intend to stay in the philippines
beyond the time
your peace exemption allows and you must
have a necessary peace however if you're
already in the philippines and deciding
ones that you you if you are in the
philippines with a tourist visa or under
the visa exception rule and you decide
you want to stay longer you can apply
for extend your visa if you if you first
receive this day of 30 days that's on
youtube 98 beats is 30 days okay so
that's most of you guys will get a
30-day temporary visa or a
tourist visa so i'll tell you what it's
called
if you if your first receipt is 30 30
days your first piece is 30 days and
want to extend your your state for
another 29 days then you can apply for a
visa waiver okay that's the visa
extension or visa waiver from the
philippines uh view of immigration at
least one week one week i said 10 days
but it's about one week before you stay
hands which is like seven days
if you have already stayed in the
philippines for 59 days
and want to extend your stay so let's
say you went you extended you got one
waiver you extended it for another 30
days 30 50 30 and 29 is 59 right so you
say now i'm saying you're getting
extinct and extension if you've already
stayed in the philippines for 59 days
and you want to extend your stay beyond
59 days you have to apply for an
extension of staying from the
philippines another extension okay and
then you can apply for extension of one
month two months and six months so i
said three months so it's one month two
months and up to six months is what you
can apply for when you want to stay
longer in
the philippines okay so uh but it costs
you man okay
so that's pretty much it man i'm telling
you you have you understand
when you come to the philippines you
have to understand what your visa tells
you that you can't and cannot do how
long you can stay when you got to go
when you have to apply reapply because a
lot of people
uh overstay if you get on the overstay
they can deport you at any time anytime
anytime just cause you american citizen
don't think that you can't get kicked
out this country don't think that your
american citizen don't mean nothing here
it just means you another joe bro okay
coming through the door
so don't get that high on your house
yeah so yeah uh you can if you overstay
your and a lot of people do that i don't
know why
it's so simple man all you got to do is
go down to the bi and be able to
immigrate this man i'd like to please
accept my visa i've been 29 day 30. i
won't stand up basically that's sure
they weren't for a
one time yeah and they're gonna check
the back this and see if your message
doesn't got locked up
they're gonna take all that first if you
ain't done that crazy then they're gonna
stand your face you know but if you
don't got locked up they'll slap
somebody and slap your work
so that's why you have to go down there
to extend your visa and a lot of
americans uh britain's uh australia they
don't know what man sometimes
sometimes we forget it sometimes we just
don't know to do it but there's a whole
bunch of reason why but when you're in
somebody else's country man you have to
follow their boobs you know special
character
who said you get special treatment you
know they don't treat me no better than
nobody else you know i got to follow the
rules i've been there eight years
uh and nobody i got the following rule
everybody else you know
don't think you spelling nobody else
then we're gonna probably and proud of
everybody come in this country look
forward actually all right but you can
extend it and they want you to extend it
they want you to want today they want
you to enjoy yourself but do it legally
we have a lot of illegal aliens in this
country that are bypassing the bureau of
immigration and when they get caught
it's no joke they put them in the jail i
remember a few minutes ago i talked
about going to the jail cell filipino
jail cell it is not nice
they sleeping on top of each other like
salt they packed most of the jails sales
in the philippines are over capacity by
a hundred percent okay so so they having
people sleeping there like this loosely
you can't even turn to the side that's
not packed there they got to sleep on
the floor it's not bad for you buddy and
they get rice
if they get rice they get a cup of rice
and a cup of water three times a day and
that's it okay so i'm telling you man
don't mess with people out here and get
yourself a joke but and then what
happens a lot of times
you might just be minding your business
you're staying out there you've been out
here six months right but you never went
downtown you never went to the bi to get
your acceptance right and you met your
mess you talked to the philippines you
got that man
no don't do that
yeah because see when they report you
you have to pay your back faith you have
to pick penalties and then they deport
you
because you overstayed okay they have a
right to do that okay and then they
don't when in the fortune i told you
just a few minutes ago when they deport
you my friends they don't just say okay
come here john sing get why are you
going home on the plane put you on dealt
okay
now that that's not like this when they
when you're locked get locked up and
being deported guess what
you're gonna first go to the jail cell
you know fingerprints and all that get
your photograph and they're gonna tag
you and bag you'll put you in a jumpsuit
yellow junk orange jumpsuit and then uh
you're gonna sit there till they feel
like sending you to the united states or
dog or whatever country you came from it
could be a year it could be six months
whenever they feel like it okay so i'm
telling you i know god has been sitting
there five years
when they feel like when they get around
to it then they send you all okay so
don't get up they talk about at least
this if yo you got to go to jail first
buddy if you can get through that jail
life existence
you might be all right
all right let's go last one man i'm out
okay i know y'all want me to get through
this
okay a long term statement
foreign purposes must have appropriate
visa the main types of philippines
issues for a longer permission include
these are long-term state pieces number
one philippine workpiece which is issued
for foreigners who will work for a
filipino company number two a filipino
student visa which is issued to
foreigners who will pursue their studies
in a filipino educational institution
number three philippine spouse visa
which is issued to the spouses of
filipino citizens and or their
independent children
number four philippine retirement
excuse me number three a philippine
retirement uh visas which is issued to
foreigners who want to
retire in the philippines and have the
necessary financial requirements to do
so okay i talked to you extensively i
did a broadcast about the philippines
retirement species called the special uh
retirees resident visa srrp you want to
look at that video
everything about it
and it helps a lot of people as i have
been told so that there you have it now
those four pieces three pieces i just
mentioned to you before whatever they
are the work visa the student visa the
spouse visa retirement visa many of you
may be interested in that so guess what
i'm gonna do a show on every one of
those visas um if it's gonna be a small
amount of time i'll try to cover them
all in one show if i see that each one's
taking a little bit more time i may
cover individually but i'm gonna try to
cover all those last pieces give you
more detail on it but i know a lot of
you guys are married out here and you
you want your lady to come to the united
states and you want to get exp spousal
be visa or americans okay i'm gonna give
you the details
what you need to do put the paperwork in
and get her to come with you uh many of
you are engaged or have a fiance
relationship with a filipina that's
already here and you want to marry her
and you want to come over for her to
come over to the united states get
married right so that's that's another
type of long-term
uh i'll tell you that well i don't
recommend a word pizza but if you have
if you have to you have to the only way
i would recommend a workpiece if you're
coming here right get a philippines to
work for a company that's already
established here but they have they're
transferring you from the united states
whatever company but they're
transferring you to a branch here and
you're going to be not making filipino
money let me make still making your
american dollars or whatever so that
that's type of visa you're so getting
more fees to get here but that type of
business is the only property that i
would recommend because you're still
going to be working on american dollars
and getting paid american money from
that company
all right but that's it man i i wanted
to bring that to you uh on the next
topic we'll look at some more pizza
information we'll talk about the fiance
visa i'm gonna talk to marriage visa or
the spousal visa i'm gonna do work visa
and i'm gonna talk to the business uh
business visa uh investment as as as
well okay i'm sorry top of three because
i don't talk to you about this the
retirement piece okay so i want you to
be aware of the details and ins and outs
of what you need to do to keep your to
get a visa and to obtain your visa and
not to get uh penalized for not
extending your visa when it's time to
extend it when i came to united to the
philippines back in 2014 i was on the
tourist pizza 9-8 visa just like many of
you will be getting a 9-day visa uh i
stayed out here for
one month and then after that one month
i decided i won't stay permanent you
know i mean i got i don't
calmed me down he said you didn't mess
up you did the right thing anyway but
yeah uh if once you come out here you
stay on at night
for as long as you can i had to renew it
every month i got tired of going down
there once a month so uh after a couple
of years after a year inside opinion for
a year after happening they change it to
where you can get a one month renewal
two months
or six months okay so that i started
getting a six month review and that
saved me a lot of time i have to go back
down but
you know getting the visa initially is
not that expensive but we're doing it
over and over each month that stuff
added up you know so i eventually now
have it's called a 13 a marriage piece
and i'll go over that visa with you as
well on the next
live stream you're with me man i'm
telling y'all y'all better listen to me

that's what i like about one of my
favorite superheroes captain america he
wasn't he'd have any special superpowers
his only superpowers when he was like a
little stronger than everybody else and
uh i think he could run a little bit
faster than other people but that was it
other than that yeah if he tried
something like
you know and so everybody made a shield
in life just like captain america you
know my [ __ ] you know my [ __ ] a little
somebody trying to get on me
i said jesus i drop down on my knee
nothing lord please i'm begging
that's gonna rise to everybody who we
got that's it all right man
we got to go we got to go hey guys but
i'm gonna
some people might want to come out here
working on it might work out for you but
but the way it will work out for you is
you have a compliment for the ssrv2
is our
visa yeah that's a permanent recipe
that's one time
but except for terrifying
jerry fleming wants i would recommend
terry
an srv visa for you because you want to
have a permanent resident pizza
and i talked to i talked to you about
that last time that's the piece you can
come and go when you get ready you have
to put i think it's uh ten thousand but
if you're a veteran which you are they
reduce that price to fifteen hundred
dollars that's courtesy to you and you
put that down in a bank account of their
choice
and uh you fill out the paperwork fill
out the paperwork put the money down and
you get your permanent residence our
permanent residence which is srv
retirement
is actually better than visa i got the
marriage american pizza but the
permanent resident visa you get exempt
let's say you want to bring household
items over here or uh stuff like that
you pay no customers do these low taxes
bring your stuff over because they want
you to come in and retire they want you
to come here live so why would they tax
you make a penalty for you to bring your
stuff so me
uh i can't if i bring my stuff over here
they're gonna text me
they go they're gonna put customs duties
on me and text me everything else okay
but the the best feature out here for
permanent pieces is the srp but if
you're going to retire you have to be 15
years old plus or more okay and you used
to be 35 before the chinese messed that
up you used to be 35 but you got to be
15 years old and that's the new visa
that i recommend for jerry fleming uh
one of our permanent riders on the show
all right that's it
okay it's been really really big we got
to go
hit that like button y'all come on now
y'all hit the like button i came a
little late today because this is the
time of day they go to lunch and i don't
know
i don't wanna hear all that stuff so i
try to i'm gonna stay up here again
tomorrow back through the same thing
come a little late because i wanna hear
the noise when i'm trying to be with my
boys
come on man y'all good all right let's
go that's it man uh we got to get we got
to go we got to go we got to go and i'm
trying to get my little show on here but
yeah
i'll be i'll be back tomorrow
and oh i always want to say something
about
the
war
that's going on in uh ukraine
um
y'all pray for the people out there
that's fighting right now and people
that are leaving it's a bad situation
ladies and gentlemen
we have people that are trying to leave
and they're being bombarded to be
shield
and they're trying all they're trying to
do is go leave leave the country
and they're being [ __ ] it's wrong man
those are workwise being committed
right before the eyes of the world and
you know uh
something has to be done you know i
talked to you guys that
i said that you know i'm not i'm i'm not
for the united nations getting this
fight right now no i'm not i'm still not
for the united states getting in this
fight right now because
to be honest with you
ukraine is not a nato
member they are an ally they want to be
a member but they're not they had an
opportunity many years ago to become a
member of nato and a member of the eu
european union they chose not to so as a
result this is what's happening to them
now they want to apply an emergency
getting emergency acceptance but it
takes years to become a member so uh
what i'm looking at is the fact that
what got me concerned was last few days
ago
they bombed a
nuclear war nuclear plant that power
plant
and and that that power plant had it got
a direct hit
we all would have been
up in the uproar right now because that
radiation was spread and if they
couldn't contain it it would spread
immediately and that's another war crime
you never hit a nuclear plant
uh in any war zone never that's just
against the g naval convention
we see that this war is doing things
that they should not be doing war is
evil war is bad it's wrong you know you
know don't remember this
what is it good for nothing absolutely
nothing remember that song about war
wasn't good for absolutely nothing
so
it's a heartbreaking situation i see the
children i see the chief the wives i see
and most of the men can't leave the
country in ukraine because they want
them to
fight yeah they need man to fight so i'm
saying be in prayer about
putin about this war and that god would
change his mind because something's
wrong with a man they want to take out
the world because if he if he is a
nuclear war plant these countries right
next to ukraine what does that mean that
means that that radiation is going to
spread to his own people so see does he
have a does he have a wish to get rid of
himself and his people too i don't know
those things that like that are coming
in my mind and i look at this every day
because i'm a history book
on these people you know and if you look
at it
if you look at the uh flip side of it
but let's look at this let's play the
devil's advocate for a minute okay
let's play delta after i'm proven okay
and i'm i'm and i live in russia okay so
uh ukraine is sister streeter right on
the board
and i see them trying to get a nato i
see them trying to get involved with
democratic state i'm retiring i'm a
dictator right i love my dictator state
and i don't like democratic states okay
and now i see this democratic nation in
ukraine trying to become a nato member
i would be concerned about that yeah
because now nato can put bases in that
ukraine and follow me when they get
ready i hope because i can understand
this concern yeah
so that's just one of the concerns he
had and that's why he invaded that's
some of the underlying reasons he
invaded ukraine so that they they would
not become a
member but however the fact that he did
that he was going to speed it up even
more i think what's going to happen is
that nato will probably give them fast
track in the membership and that that
will help ukraine fight their aggressor
russia even more now you understand also
when you're talking about putin uh if
you remember the monroe doctrine i
remember one of the doctors from
fifth grade fourth grade um he's smart
in the fifth grade right you remember
the monroe doctrine they taught y'all
about
president james uh monroe he in 1823
he declared that he created a doctrine
for the united states that said that if
any country any european country or any
other country come to america to start a
colony that would be considered a threat
to our nation and we will be at war that
is the monroe doctrine so now ladies and
gentlemen guess what
everyone is saying now that this
doctrine is putin took that same
mentality and now they're calling his
war against
ukraine the putin doctor he's saying now
if anybody flies uh creates an ozone fly
zone the country that creates that no
longer will be considered uh as a part
of this war against them as well so
that's the putin doctrines and uh it's
very very hard for me to see one
individual in 2022 pulling up the entire
world not only does this war cost your
bodies and lives but it's going to cost
you money too it's going to cross your
pocket don't you see the gas prices
going up here in the philippines the gas
prices have gone up every week uh since
the war and now tomorrow they've been
going up for one peso right tomorrow
beginning tuesday they're gonna go up
from four to five pesos per liter okay
so and food prices of when sky high okay
so not only here it's probably where you
are too because russia is a huge oil
producer and gas producing they've been
selling it to germany all european now
shut up you know so those everything is
going to be sky high all because of one
thing so i'm saying this
the united states
i don't want him to get into war right
now i don't want him to get involved
with that right now because ukraine is
not a nato member okay
but at some point in time
whether they're a member or not guess
what the united states gonna have to get
involved and european
countries are going to have to get
involved such as germany
france you know
they're gonna have to because you cannot
let one person dominate the entire world
and that's what's happening right now
you think those sanctions are doing
anything for them no
they're not doing nothing
not right now eventually long-term they
will hurt the nation but you know
it's just a little bump in the world for
them right now they're continuing their
dirty deeds yeah so uh eventually and
y'all need to prepare for this because
eventually uh the united states all the
nato nation will have to to go against
him all right i just had to get that out
because i keep you all informed what's
going on with me what's going on my mind
and i keep i'm keeping up with this war
and those of you you got any sense you
better keep up with it too because you
said well they don't hear about it [ __ ]
you never know the mother can be in your
front door they got missiles now they
can reach america you didn't know that
did you
russia's got some missiles they can
reach it and so does north korea and
china working on the same thing okay so
be ready be aware be diligent and and
keep on the lookout and more importantly
ladies and gentlemen keep in prayer
prayer okay pray yeah that's the only
thing that's going to keep you sanity
keeping over god answers prayer okay
that's it for now guys this is
another comment got another question all
right let's go let's find out who this
is who is this said he gonna beat them
got another comment in the house all
right uh
okay murphy said black man late okay
what do you do matt what you matt what's
up with you man
you don't have to fool with me
he says they're calling up
okay matt i'm gonna block you man
but you must have did something crazy i
got you man
i heard nato was cleaning the same plane
yeah i heard it i heard that also
they're sending some just fighter jets
to fight uh because right now give a
call up man i gotta knock this guy out
she's fast food
i'm not getting about he don't see this
i'm crazy
okay
all right but yeah uh
they nato
some of their nato countries usa has
approved that they will send fighter
jets to help them to give them fighting
chances
uh literally ukraine has no no airport i
mean they got a few planes but now
there's enough to to combat the flat
flights that uh
russia has okay claims that russia has
and then to be honest with you ukraine
has been doing an outstanding job
against a very very formidable force
which is russia
uh they've been holding their ground you
know they're losing a few cities here
and there but they've been giving russia
here i mean they've been putting it down
on them you know and so uh y'all heard
it the other day that uh putin said well
this court this this war is doing this
conflict is going according to schedule
you're lying stop lying
they said in their mind they thought it
would be done in a day or two
and they didn't know the strength and
the and the
uh the the will of character that the
people call ukrainians had and they're
not gonna come in and stump all over
even if they take every nation every
city every every uh township in that
nation
ukrainians gonna get up and fight until
the last man standing so this is not
gonna be an easy quick fix war okay it's
gonna be drawn out and it's gonna be
even if they overtake the country
uh over and run every city overtake
every city there will still be pockets
and pockets of what resistance
that's what they had in world war ii
pockets of resistance that's out of
country for liberating they have people
that was overtaken and and being held by
the russians but they resisted they did
that uh guerrilla warfare urban warfare
shoot and run shoot and run you know
that's how they did and he took them out
so it's going to be a long going-out
fight the whole world is going to suffer
not just ukraine everybody going to
suffer because this so everybody
eventually in my opinion will have to
get involved all right guys that's it
for now this is bobbied saying take care
at least you say take care
god bless
and
peace
people get ready
[Music]
you
