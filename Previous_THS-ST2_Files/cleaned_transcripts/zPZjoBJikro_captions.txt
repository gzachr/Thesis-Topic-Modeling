tubers two bets the ever whitening circle of crazy 
people i'm home welcome back daddy paul thank you  
so much baby mate and so i had to make the first 
video home with my partner in crime over here a  
little baby may and uh we missed each other a lot 
and so i just wanted to say how grateful i am to  
have had friends to go to when i left and how 
grateful i am to have such a lovely companion to  
come home too it makes life good on both ends and 
so i thought i would interview baby may because it  
turns out that after three years of being together 
and two years of doing youtube together i've never  
interviewed you yeah i mean you've joined me 
on stuff but i've never sat and just asked you  
questions right yeah okay so here we go what did 
you do while i was gone how did you feel your day  
the purse very sad very sad yeah and then i 
wake up i open the door i lock the balcony  
i imagine you're sitting the outside and then 
i think oh i prefer to daddy pull the copy
but you were supportive of me leaving yeah 
because of my father yeah you understand  
yeah yeah i mean it wasn't like i was going 
off on some frivolous trip yeah just a jiggy  
jack around yeah yeah you understood that 
there was yeah family behind yeah super super  
family orientated and she understands 
it with her parents and her sisters and  
all of that and i am too you know so it was great 
for me to see my sister my nephew his wife my kids  
my dad i did an interview with my dad yeah 
and that's gonna always be in my heart  
and i'm honestly gonna try to get back there once 
this covered nonsense ends um more frequently like  
every year and a half or something like that and 
i told baby may that starting now we're going to  
start working on getting her over on a fiance 
visa but she has to apply for a passport which  
i've been telling her for the last six months 
to are you going to apply for a passport yep
and she hasn't done it so finally i broke down i 
was just going to make her do it but i realized  
she never would because she's afraid of it she's 
afraid of forms and the computer and all that kind  
of stuff so i'm going to pitch in and i found 
out today the first thing we need is your birth  
certificate yeah and we need you know the name of 
your parents which you have a problem with because  
i asked you once what's your father's name and 
you said dad so i don't know what's his name and  
you go yeah i want his dad i've always called him 
dad she didn't know her dad's first name was jimmy  
so anyway sorry dad and your mom but you know what 
it's just the culture out here they don't it's not  
that formal where in america it's it's very common 
so anyway you got gifts so you want to share some  
of your gifts that you got right yeah okay so 
first my favorite favorite yeah i always tell  
to my youtube channel uh daddy fall for a gift for 
me that lollipop that's my number one favorite i

then from my subscriber thank you so much  
i really appreciate that yeah thank you so what 
was the typical day for you while i was gone  
uh for the time yeah yeah every day what 
did you do you you you video you did a  
lot of videos no i mean i mean your day 
was like you did video after video after  
video after video every day and i was really proud 
of you because they were really good videos they  
really were yeah and some of your best yet 
you got a lot of views on them yeah you got  
a lot of new subscribers yeah meanwhile my my 
channel went right down to you know what that i
and i was too tired to be honest with you to make 
a video you know when i was in cebu i was going  
to make a video about my hotel room i was going to 
give you a view i was going to drive through cebu  
and i just said no i'm just too tired i didn't 
get any sleep so anyway i'm back i'm recharged  
we went out yesterday to lunch we went to 
uh latino and had a nice lunch after i slept  
and then i came back and i slept about 
14 hours yeah yeah i just passed out man  
i mean it all kind of i was really excited when 
i got home it was great to see you great to be  
with you and it was nice to get back you know in 
my own little home here where life goes my way
and and um and i just all of a sudden just like 
the air went out of me it was like the adrenaline  
was gone after getting home and i was excited 
to see you at the bus staying well yeah and uh  
she was totally cool man she uh rented a van for a 
thousand pay so it's just a driver's license what  
for the from the bus station to home yeah and it 
was really a smart idea because the guy was able  
to help with the luggage which was really heavy 
right i brought back two big ass bags of stuff  
yeah and um a lot of it was just clothes for 
me because i wanted to find stuff that fit and  
and was easy to pick out and a half i mean i 
got jeans i'm wearing jeans right now i think  
they were like 15 bucks and i've looked at jeans 
here and they want a hundred bucks for them uh at  
lee plaza of all places yeah so you know i just i 
just can't bring myself to do it i don't i'm not a  
cheapskate but i'm not stupid with money so i knew 
when i went on a trip the first place was good  
old-fashioned walmart where where you can still 
get a bargain and good stuff and easy to pick out  
so that was fun yeah but we're getting off of 
you so you made videos and um you said one day  
you collapsed yeah you didn't tell me about this 
while i was gone yeah because i afraid what what
because i'm afraid what if you 
call to your friend coming here  
yeah so i would like you not so did you 
pass out or something i mean did you  
like i wake up and then i opened that door and you 
get dizzy or something yeah yeah yeah and i look  
in the outside like run out like brown out yeah 
wow and then like falling down and then ending  
you fell down yeah and then on slowly for 
i think five minutes wow yeah so she just  
you know all of her symptoms and medical 
problems i've concluded are mental
because you're just flat-out 
mental that's all there is to it  
you can talk yourself into being 
sick faster than anybody i know
you're a trip man and you're also 
going to learn to drive the scooter now  
yeah all right so you're ready to 
rock and roll on the scooter thank god  
and i came home to my scooter with a dead battery 
and a flat tire so good job keeping up the scooter  
that's my own fault i should have had 
your brother drive it while i was gone  
i should have had your brother drive my 
scooter so the battery would stay good  
and the tires would stay good so we're gonna 
call our friend toto and go by and see him  
and he'll come over and fix the scooter 
which is what he always does right yeah yeah  
and then you surprised me because when i got back 
uh we had we had been in a little accident on the  
motorbike just before i left remember we hit that 
yeah yeah well he actually caused the accident  
we won't belabor it and uh we got home that 
day and he said i think we should get a car
so i was thinking about that car and i drove to 
cebu with my friend ed in his car toyota wego and  
i really liked it and so i thought what the hell 
we start a little savings account and we we buy a  
car not now you know i just spent all this money 
on the trip yeah yeah so that depleted things but  
in the future i said i asked her i said you think 
i should get a new car a new scooter because the  
scooter's starting to get a little funky and 
uh she said a scooter surprised me yeah because  
i thinking first you're allowed to spend the 
vacation yeah oh you're thinking about the money  
yeah but i'm happy because you're with your father 
and your son and indeed and then your sister and  
then all right yeah i'm happy yeah yeah yeah that 
was the best part and we made a lot of new friends  
along the way you know all of them are really big 
fans of yours so again i can't express what it's  
like to leave here i feel so blessed because i 
left and i ran into nothing but friendly helpful  
generous people people who gave me their time 
and their energy and their car rides and all  
that kind of stuff it was just amazing and um just 
how i don't know and then i get to come home to  
you know again just this loving woman so i was 
blessed on both ends yeah uh i granted that the  
the journey was arduous but it was still so much 
better than it could have been i had made plans  
to take a bus from my sisters to las vegas and 
steve stepped up and said no man i'll take you  
i had several guys offer to take me and that's 
a long drive and i couldn't even get these guys  
to take gas money so it was just incredible it 
really was we had a couple of get-togethers and  
i showed you all the people they all talked 
highly about you yeah yeah and so what else  
happened while i was gone let's see you passed 
out and we had a hard time talking because  
of number one the time difference and i you of 
course go to sleep every night at seven o'clock  
yeah and then when i got home i was wiped out 
um every day i called it good tired because  
i was tired but i had a good day you know 
going here and there yeah and so that's that  
and so now i'm back and uh i'm happy to be back 
and i'm happy to be with you and we need to make  
a bunch of videos and i'm looking forward to that 
yeah and i need my my wingman over here because uh  
i don't know what happened but i just kind of um 
without her helping me or me bouncing ideas off of  
her she's very creative and so especially when it 
comes to thumbnails and stuff like that yeah and i  
really needed her help and she understands how i 
like to do things and i understand how she likes  
to do things yeah so i think we bounce off of each 
other really good yeah you know whoops chick okay
and so you got some new clothes yeah and um you 
got some new looks yeah and uh you're really happy  
about that yeah i'm so happy yeah yeah yeah and so 
i guess in the future what we'll do is i'm gonna  
do a future video about the trip itself and some 
of the mechanical stuff and uh but i really just  
wanted to make a video honoring davey may that was 
it that was it because she was very steadfast she  
contacted me whenever she could i 
knew she was a little distressed out  
but from being alone and all that kind of stuff 
and we made a little fake out video before i left  
and i told everybody that your sister and her kids 
were staying here with you yeah but that was a lie  
that was due to secure security concerns and you 
bought a lock a padlock for the gate yeah i think  
we always have this greatly we've been having 
these people just walk in and said hey this is  
where baby may and paul live hi and it's like yeah 
but we don't have any clothes on come back later  
you know how about a call first or something 
so you were terrified for one time oh yeah i  
forgot the laugh oh yeah yeah and did someone 
come in your friend coming up in the gate said  
what do you want uh do you like uh my girlfriend 
i bring her or do you want a phone i said no  
thank you that's it okay bye bye and bill 
offered to give you a ride down the hill  
and these are people that are just being totally 
cool these are no weirdos or anything like that  
these are just people offering to help because 
they knew she was alone so kirk came down and said  
hey you need anything and i want my girlfriend to 
come over keep you company again an outpouring of  
just you know generosity um our friend bill 
who lives down the street saw baby me walking  
down the street pulled over and offered to 
give her a ride yeah there was no tricycle  
there's no tricycle and baby may refused 
him because she loves bill we all love bill  
but she didn't want anybody to 
see her on the back with bill
because you know what this would have started 
oh a little bit i would have gotten i would have  
gotten a text saying hey your girlfriend's 
fooling around with oh bill down the street  
all these crazy gossips get started and she 
knew that and so she was just like no it's  
okay you know i'll just keep walking i'll get 
my exercise he didn't want to refute him but  
i'll tell bill later he'll laugh i brought him 
some t-shirts he'll be fine he'll bribe him
so anyway it's good to be home yeah this was a 
really big interview with may it was just most of  
us just bs with each other so you got anything you 
want to tell everybody before we call it a day in  
the video you look with me i'm very tiny girl you 
are very tiny you are super skinny yeah because  
before your hair uh every hour i eat and then 
you can once a day yeah you lost weight you lost  
weight and you know another thing is what blew 
my mind is i ate all this garbage while i was in  
in cal i mean in california and in las vegas i 
was eating bread i was eating uh what i have oh  
i had chocolate shakes three trips to in-n-out 
burger baby i'll tell you and i bought her you  
know what i got her i got her a little in-n-out 
hat you know those plat paper hats can't find it  
and my sister called me this morning says 
hey you got a pair of shoes here at the house  
great what the hell else is missing and so what 
else so it was a little tiny thing but hindsight  
being 20 20 man i should have got four or five of 
those hats and put them in different luggages and  
they're free they just give about most the kids 
wear them but i had this idea of doing an in-n-out  
uh video for you to do on your channel 
yeah and it was just gonna be a funny  
thing that i had in my head but she did get an 
in-n-out t-shirt from um uh china china china  
oh yeah yeah i'm still having trouble with names 
oh i'm bringing chinese china dave thank you so  
much for your gift that like that i gave her

doing good and i'm very proud of the fact  
that despite the um the obstacles they're up 
against the challenges that they face they're  
facing it like men you know they're being like

congested it's too um it's got it's just but there 
is a place matan newtown that i was by and uh we  
could airbnb a condo there i think pretty cheap 
but no i fine well that's just in the hotel honey  
that was just in my hotel because of odette so we 
would verify that we could get wi-fi and all that  
kind of stuff but they got the world's greatest 
latte coffee at this one little shop and i would  
like to take may there and because we've only 
gone there under duress it was for me to get an  
exit clearance both times yeah right yeah and that 
was a hassle you know and you weren't feeling good  
of course yeah but anyway i want to take her there 
i want to take her to the neighboring islands  
and then in the process um i'm going to start 
this week getting her passport and getting her  
a visa k1 visa or a fiance visa it takes at least

when the covent thing stops and all you have to do  
is buy an airline ticket and show your passport
