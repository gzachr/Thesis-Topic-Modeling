before and also hakuna matata like come on
like i i really don't know what to expect
from this it can go really well and then also
it can go really south real fast i've been
a huge fan of filipino sangers for the longest
time one of my faves is kz my all-time fave
is casey and then we have katrina velard and
we have tons and tons of other singers to

any further ado smugglers hakuna matata all
right let's get started i'm pretty [Music]
excited
foreign
okay so it's not the original hakuna matata
that i imagined but it's a pretty pretty pretty
cool adaptation it's not an adaptation it's
a different song but critical adaptation of
what hakuna matata actually means which is
basically chill i like this um vibe i like
his flow honestly i really have to say that
i find filipino rap incredibly incredibly
impressive i fell in love with how it sounds
when i first heard casey actually rapping
in her song and um the language is just so
fantastically fitted for a wrap because there's
a lot of lo there's a lot of and there's just
a certain type of pronunciation that when
you put it in a really fast flow it sounds
incredible it sounds really
impressive
[Music]
my
[Music]
[Music] foreign i'm 
not sure if it's just a tagalog but most of
the filipino artists that i've listened before
like the language is just so beautiful not
just for a very lyrical stuff um like we've
heard in for example paobaya from moira de
la torre uh it was it can be so super soft
and very lyrical and um on the other side
you can put it in such a fast flow and something
that is supposed to be a little bit more you
know a little bit more punchy a little bit
faster it's supposed to have a little bit
more fun impact on the listener and uh definitely
more beat based and it still works beautifully
there is a lot of usage of put le in a very
very pronounced dominant way and a lot of
times they follow very close after each other
which is kind of it's creating this interesting
sound which can just sound super punchy very
fast i really like it in uh the filipino wrap
even though this is a rap song i'm happy to
react to it because um one of the very important
things in singing is phrasing and i think
uh phrasing is something that rap is basically
based on you have to know how to phrase you
know have to know where to put your breath
and how to redistribute your breath because
there are long phrases that need to be just
you know following after each other you cannot
fall out of the flow so breath management
and phrasing is everything there and there
is a lot to learn from
foreign [Music]
me
[Music]
foreign
he doesn't have unusual type of tone quality
but it really doesn't take anything from the
way he expressed himself he's doing it very
well it fits well both the red parts and the
singing parts the singing parts i'm gonna
be straight forward are not anything too difficult
but in a rap song first of all props that
he's singing the singing part because usually
you have a red part and then you have a singer
that just goes into the singing parts and
just do the singing job kind of for you that's
why we have so many columns of rappers and
the singers so if i have a wrapper that is
solid on both fronts and then the singing
part and on the red part props for them job
well done i think if you listen to this song
second or third time you can easily tune into
the singing part and just join and sing along
and basically i think this whole song is built
on that you want people to have fun you want
people to be able to sing along and dance
and i think that's where he really succeeded
[Music]
[Music] little saxophone
[Music] foreign [Music]
it would be nice to have a second voice there
it would be really cool
well thank you so so much for everybody who
really really really bombarded me with this
one you really guys really wanted to see this
and i'm kind of happy because this was a chill
flowy song that is just so fitting for the
summer and even though it was mainly rap as
i said before wrap is great for really studying
the phrasing and the breadth of distribution
and even if we go back to that video and you're
gonna watch parts where he was wrapping the
longer phrases the breath has to be definitely
there it has to be well under control you
have to know where are those tiny little places
where you can fast breathe in and then you
have to redistribute that tiny breath into
very long phrase so birth control is super
important and also phrasing you don't want
to sound like one of those auto generated
um voices that are just gonna read the text
for you phrasing and intonation is really
important in rap to kind of pull people in
intonation on the other side is intonation
definitely has to be there if you don't want
to sound like a robot it has to correlate
with a flow it has to correlate with a beat
and and many times it also has to correlate
with the mood of the song with this one it
was definitely way more melodic mainly because
it was really an upbeat happy song quite a
summer jam i would say i had fun thank you
so much for every single person who recommended
this one i will be definitely going back and
checking which bus way more now because i
have more time for that and also you've been
