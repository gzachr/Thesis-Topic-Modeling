it's interesting to see how the how the woman's 
role in the world is changing and they can be way  
more things than what they used to to be and they 
can be pretty but they also could be talented and  
could also do a lot of other stuff and i never

lot of women have to fight for their rights  
fight for respect for basic common sense is 
weird i just learn how challenging is to be
