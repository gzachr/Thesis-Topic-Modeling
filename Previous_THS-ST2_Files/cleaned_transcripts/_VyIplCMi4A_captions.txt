Thank you very much Annahaban Armonio for
using the pinoy planet hashtag in your
cooking video
so today guys i will be cooking your
dish sige
mag luluto tayo! okay so the dish is called homemade
biko with latik
using three ingredients coconut cream
malagkit
and brown sugar or muscovado so
according to this recipe guys i need to
wash the malagkit for three times
WHY three times?
the rice has taken many showers guys
must be really clean no?
while the malagkit is cooking i'm gonna
prepare the
latik so i have a coconut cream
so i think this is a Bisaya style i'm
not sure but
i think i read it so i'm gonna add some
coconut cream
this will take a long time guys i'm
gonna speed up the video okay
so the latik is almost ready guys and i
want to make a super special
shout out today to Thalia,
Nathan and Malou

time guys don't forget to use the pinoy
planet hashtag okay

your dish

out

taste
