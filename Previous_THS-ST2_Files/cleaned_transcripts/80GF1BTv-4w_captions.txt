now the question is that why
you should travel to philippines
i was there for two weeks in this
14 days i want to visit
maximum city and iceland so i made a
good plan
from help of google map
i went to cebu city very fast
then after that went to palawan
island i took a flight for
puerto princesa and visited the most
beautiful beach a little
after that went to angela city
which is famous as like pataya city
and after that visited many more city
and island like quezon city
batangas city puerto gallara island
and manila both are developed
then back to india so it's
all depends on our smart plan to save
the money
now question is that how much expensive
philippines philippines is actually
so cheap country if you travel
like a local you can find
hotel for 10 dollars
or book a hostel for only
five dollars you can get a food
for one dollar you can ride a bike
for one dollar for eight kilometers
even you can rent a bike for whole day
only five dollars and if you ride
jeepney
it will cost you only 20 cents
please
you can buy a sim card at 40 pesos
it means 80 cents and indian rupees only
60
without any document and most important
thing you can get a beer
only 50 cents even you can buy a bottle
of alcohol for only one dollar
twenty cents such by philippines a pure
geo
it's more fun in philippines but
in night time much more fun
you can go to clubs pubs
open
so you can sing from hut in front of
many people
and can friendship easily
[Applause]
