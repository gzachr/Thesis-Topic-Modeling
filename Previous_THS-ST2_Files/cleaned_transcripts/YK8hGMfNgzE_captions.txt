Welcome to Ronette Channel....... yheeee ....Thank you mwahhhh
hello everyone this is Ronette Jenkins  and welcome to my channel ,
and so by this time you knew already
what our topic today, so we are going to talk
expectation vs reality of having a  foreigner husband or boyfriend
so im saying that if foreigner means, that only white people, so what its mean is
either what nationality you will meet as your husband, who's not same
Filipino as you, so it could be British same  as my husband,  American, Italian , Norwegian or what else
German or Canadian or Korean or Chinese
or whatever Japanese so what our expectations
but of course , what can i say here or talk here
only base on experiences, and what my friends share to me
but of course I"m not going to mentions names or who are they
so Im only give you three example here
of expectation vs reality, so you just add it on
if you think there's more, just comment down below, in the comment section, then we can talk it again next time.
So hopefully, I can give justice to what im saying hahaha
So our expectations to the foreigner that we are going to meet
not only to be your husband or you just going to meet for first time.
Or you just thinking to marry a foreigner. Because for me that's what my dream
since I was a child I really wanted to marry a long nose, blue eyes and a white skin man
so that's really my dream when I was child
so....but of course while you grown up, our dreams change or just gone , then later on, my dream come true
because at that time we really don't know where to find a foreigner,
for me I went to the UK that's why I meet my husband
but next time we'e going to talk how we meet. for now
lets continue the expectation versus reality, so if your expecting  that
all foreigners are rich. well...
that's not true, reality not all of them 
foreigners are rich
so maybe if you think that their money is more already when they bring it to the Philippines
Yes that's more already because the standard of living in the Philippines is a bit low
compare to other foreigner countries, but that's money if its in their country
that's not much or not enough sometimes
so lets not expect that all the foreigner are rich, there's some of them are poor also
same as we are in 
Philippine, so don't expect you that
you just going to be frustrate or disappoint
not all foreigners are rich, there's some that less fortunate too
example my husband, when I met him his in the UK, that means his not working
because his work before was just a contractual,
means two years his working then two year his stop working, until another works come
that's it , his working one year then the following year his jobless
so that's  mean that his money he save for the year his working, he used also for time his stop working
so when I met him that his situation
but i did't really bother if his rich or poor, when we met, that's why
I'm not disappointed
let's not expect, if they don't have enough obviously they will not afford to go to our country to find a wife too anyway
that's what i can say
not all foreigners are rich , then we will not going to be disappoint
then the next one is Attitude so same like us Filipino they have attitude also,
so we really need to know them more before we commit or go with them
but some of us are so brave to just go with them without even knew this person
I had watched a video before, about marrying a foreigner, this girl went to America as a fiancee visa,
when she arrived in america, her & her fiance didn't get on to each other,
so they separated but
eventually the girl found the right man for her.
We will going to experience that at first we are so happy, so generous (not forgiving)
that he will give you everything, the moon & the stars
but later on it will not be the same, so its depend on us on
to stay on that situation or how have a good relationship
not only you can do it also from your partner, so for attitude don't
expect that all for them are nice or have  a good attitude, because truly some of them have a bad temper too
so lets prepare our self for what ever happen, prepare our heart
so the third one is ways of living
WAY LIVING do not expect
what we used to do as Filipino
are the same as they are, no its wrong Reality not they same
example, we are Filipino we ate all together in the table , yes there are some
foreigners that eat all together, but some of them are not also
there's a time that they will not eat yet, how about us that we used to eat three times a day
breakfast, lunch & supper
example my husband if his not hungry he will not eat
you can't push him to eat and join you,
not means that it always like that we didn't eat together,
but because he goes to work and he have his packed lunch
but in the night he ate  too late already
and I can't wait for him to eat too late
so ate alone sometimes at night, but not all the time
that all the 3 lists of EXPECTATION vs REALITY
first that all foreigner are rich reality not all of them are not rich
maybe there some of them are poor but hard working
but if you met
the one that not too hard working,
so we really need to be careful to meet him, that all I can say
do not expect there they are all fortunate , then don't expect that all for the are too good
reality some of them are not too good or have a bad attitude also
we really need to adjust to their family, friends
that we just meet for the first time and not the same us Filipino, your only lucky
if you boyfriend or a husband,  know
how to adjust also to our co Filipinos or family
going to... so reality, I'm not saying that they don't know to adjust
just don't expect that all of them are good
third one is way of living, do not expect that what we used to do are the same as they are
because it a big no, they have there own
way of living, example not all of them used to eat rice
most of them only eat potato, but of course some of them eat rice too, they don't eat dry fish
how can we convince them to eat, like me i can't cook dry fish in my house
if my husband is around, because he will get sick and feel nausea
i don't want him to feel bad & vomited because of the smell
so very rare i cook dry fish
so i hope i gave you clear information, or i said it right (don't know the right term or katuturan comment down below)
