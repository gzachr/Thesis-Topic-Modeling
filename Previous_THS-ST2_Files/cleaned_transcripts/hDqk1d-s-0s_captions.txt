today is a super special day because 
we're gonna make adobong Puti and I  
will bring it to my parents we have 
a beautiful piece of baboy here but  
it has a nice piece of taba we'll 
clean the baboy with a little bit  
of salt gonna put the Asin first then I'll 
just rub it in we'll do this on both sides  
so I think I fixed the audio by now the baboy 
we're gonna leave it for a few minutes before  
we're gonna wash it now what makes this episode 
today so special well today is not my recipe
but it's your recipe pogi let's greet the viewer 
let's greet the viewer I ask you to send me the  
recipe by email so thank you so much for sending 
me the recipes for this special version of adobo  
now let me see by whom was this sent yeah I will 
let you know in a minute the recipe says that I  
have to cut this into thick cubes you can see this 
piece of baboy it has a really nice mataba here  
it's very thick this might be a little bit too big 
I think we're gonna do half of this ah like that  
see now we have many pieces do not cut them too 
small as with this recipe those will probably be  
shredded into bits by the end if you cut the meat 
into bite size so here's the wok uh the recipe  
said that I needed the big large Wok okay this is 
the one that I have and there's many ingredients  
here I am super curious how this recipe will turn 
out before we're gonna put some mantica here and  
then we're gonna fry the baboy like crispy golden 
brown crispy golden brown see okay let's do  
okay add pork and saute until you get a 
good crust on the pieces of pork guess we  
have to do this in batches because we have 
a lot of pork meat so there we go see yo
can you hear the sound
this color looks already amazing 
you can see them getting crispy  
guys already this pork smells amazing and 
we did not even yet add the bawang thank you  
so much Kriss tina because you are the one to 
send this recipe Miss Cristina coconut vinegar  
is something new for me to try niyog it says 
so I'm really excited to try this one today
oh oh it smells so nice it smells 
like a little bit more mild  
Here's the final baboy here is all the pork that 
are already fried and here is a lot of bad one  
yes Christina's recipe said that we have to use 
maraming bawang so we're gonna use a lot today  
if you also want to share your recipe on Pinoy 
Planet so does my parents can also try your  
recipe please go ahead send an email you can see 
the email address in the about section on Pinoy  
Planet so this book is very hot so sometimes 
the oil is coming out but I guess it should  
be fine well that's really a lot of power 
now I will be adding all the pork back okay
I'm just gonna mix this a 
little bit with the bawang  
and now it's one of the secrets to so the 
recipe says that we have to add the salt first  
we're gonna add salt everything is feeling lang 
so I'm gonna put quite a bit of salt because we  
have no soy sauce and now it's a very special 
moment because we're going to add the vinegar  
again this is coconut vinegar okay so just on 
feeling I'm gonna put quite a bit of vinegar  
maybe like a good cup or so and the recipe says 
that we need to cover it so we're gonna cover this  
and we should not stir okay so the pork should 
not be stirred just leave it for a few minutes  
like this gonna simmer for a few minutes 
and then we're gonna go to the next step  
a few minutes later so now we're supposed to 
add some water have some boiling water here
we have to cover it again okay
until the pork is tender I'm also steaming 
some broccoli here to make the dish a little  
bit more healthy for the final steps 
we're gonna add a little bit of bay leaf  
and Thai red chili I'm gonna add one red chili 
it was optional Christina said but I think it's  
still nice you know a little bit spice and 
we're gonna add some black pepper as well  
I couldn't get Sprite unfortunately it's uh 
it was kind of strange because actually I was  
able to get all the ingredients I went to the 
grocery stores to the Asian market I got the  
pork and I got even the coconut vinegar but 
there was no Sprite or seven up but I have  
something that is very similar by now we should 
remove the lid so I have already removed the lid
put the something like a Sprite
it is going to be one can I will also add 
the red Sealy one spicy sili as well as a  
little bit of black pepper what I like about this 
kind of adobo recipes is that it's one without  
marination you know you don't need to marinate 
the meat so here we go this is our adobong puti  
uh broccoli we are there I'm 
excited to see their reaction
from the Philippines the special recipe 
for today is and by Christina oh Aguilera
many Filipino dishes are eating with 
rice do I need the sauce yeah the  
sauce is about you can put a little 
bit of sabaw on top okay extra sahab  
syrup what's up the smell wonderful The Taste 
is wonderful it's nice the sauce is normal
yeah let's cut a double potato
nice actually it's the first time I use 
this ingredient it's a coconut vinegar  
oh I don't know in the Philippines coconut 
vinegar we've never heard of it it's spicy  
but it's okay not too spicy not too spicy 
no I put one Chili Pepper Thai Chili pork  
belly it's good for my belly I like it 
I love it and want some more of it beef  
yeah not some beef maybe and how about the 
Filipino dessert then they send the dessert  
course maybe tilapia filet we can make tilapia in 
coconut sorry I said tilapia filet I meant bangus
okay
I don't know
