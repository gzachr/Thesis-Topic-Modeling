Guys today i will try to make lelot
balatong!
OK, let's cook! Like i said last time guys
this dish was
requested by Ola and Alexandra from
Dagupan City, Pangasinan. So I really have no idea
about this dish it was the first time
for me to hear it but
i searched on the internet how to make
it i added the mungo beans guys
just toast them a little bit let's add
a can of coconut milk
you know i think i'm gonna wait with the
coconut milk because i want to
make the monggo beans a bit brown right
i think i need to make them brown
is this a uh is this a common dish guys
in the philippines because
i've been in the philippines many times
but i have never seen or eaten it
so the beans are not getting brown yet
so i'm gonna
turn up the heat a little bit okay
should they become darker like this
the smell is amazing by the way okay
since it's the first time for me i'm
just gonna try
adding the coconut milk
The gata is in guys it smells even
better with the
with the gata so i'm gonna add a little
bit of
sugar don't have brown sugar today so
i'm just gonna put some white sugar
just a little bit i'm not gonna make it
too sweet because
i might add some condensed milk at the
end
okay a little water guys because
otherwise the malagkit will be maybe too
dry so i'm gonna add a little bit
just like that let's just cover this for
a while
maybe it's time to add the malagkit
i think i just might add it
it's getting a little bit dry guys so
i don't want it to happen the same thing
as with the champorado that i made
so let me add some condensed milk
do you remember guys when i made the
champorado it became very dry
otherwise it would be a failure again
guys
the texture is getting much better guys
i added also a little bit of extra
water
and i'm gonna add a little bit of salt
when this dish was requested guys but
what a name
cannot even pronounce it
but when i googled the dish i saw that
it can be called ginataang monggo right?
easier pronunciation for me
i keep adding water and coconut milk and
it's still thick and the beans are still
hard it takes
a long time what do you think guys
this took a long time guys i think
several hours but finally the beans are
soft so let's try it
i received lots of requests from you
guys uh for
the next dish to cook filipino food
uh but i didn't decide yet which one so
please feel free to add more okay
i'm gonna try the ginataang monggo
hmm oh it tastes good
i don't have any reference for this dish
because i never ate it before
but i think it tastes pretty good so
thanks a lot for watching guys
i'll see you next time with more
filipino food
