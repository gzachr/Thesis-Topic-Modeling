Hello guys! Welcome back and I'm back again with 
a new Informational video and it would be about  
the Legal Capacity to get Married in the 
Philippines. I would be providing the requirements  
and the process on how we got our legal capacity 
to get married, well, specifically for my husband  
okay? I already made a video about how to get 
married with a foreigner in the Philippines and  
one of the important requirements there is the 
legal capacity to get married and I mentioned  
there also that getting the legal capacity to 
get married is a whole lot of different topic  
because there's a lot of requirements inside of it 
before you get the legal capacity to get married  
so it was really a lot of hassle like it's 
hard for me to sit down with my husband because  
he's so traumatized with one of the requirements of 
the legal capacity to get married so finally, I was  
able to talk to him and you know sit down about 
and discuss about the requirements and the process  
on it because most of the time it was my husband 
who went inside of the embassy to process all of  
this thing. I just came there in the embassy by the 
end. So anyway, these are the requirements for the  
legal capacity to get married in the philippines 
this is specifically for indian nationals so if  
your partner is from another nationality just 
check out the website there would be some  
requirements on it here's the requirement first 
is the original indian passport with photocopy  
original valid ID of the Indian national and then 
Filipino national with photocopy and original  
birth certificate of the filipino national and 
authenticated by PSA, original joint separate  
affidavit of parents of the filipino national 
giving consent to the marriage with the indian  
national irrespective of any age which should 
be authenticated by the DFA in case of the death  
of the parents, the applicant should provide this 
death certificate duly authenticated by DFA  
MEA separate affidavit of parents of the indian 
national giving consent to the marriage with a  
filipino national irrespective of any age which 
should be authenticated by locally notarized from  
india if staying in india or attested by indian 
mission in the country if staying outside of the  
india so number  6  is copies of valid IDs of 
the parents both your partners and yours then the  
original affidavit of singleness or willingness 
of the filipino national authenticated by DFA  
yes and the CENOMAR.  CENOMAR from you and for your 
indian partner and then the joint affidavit from  
indian and filipino national on how they met 
each other and what are their plans after  
getting married original employment certificate of 
the company of the indian national like you know  
he has a work, he has to get this then the 
certificate of bachelorhood issued by the Area  
Sub-Divisional Magistrates (SDM)/ Court authorities 
from where the applicant belongs counter attested  
by the home department of the state concerned 
and then counter attested by the CPV division  
of the Ministry of External Affairs Patiala house 
of New Delhi one of the requirements that made my  
husband really traumatized is this certificate 
of bachelorhood because it's really hard to get  
it well it depends on which state your partner 
is in because you know each state has different  
processes here in India so it depends but in our 
case we are unfortunate because it's it's really  
hard to get this certificate of bachelorhood 
here in Mumbai and these are all the requirements  
to check it out and get the two photocopies of 
each in case if your Indian partner is already  
married in the Philippines, planning to marry again 
these are the requirements so just check it out
These three affidavits is really important 
just plan it beforehand to get this when you're  
planning to get married you need to get it like 
first is the uh affidavit of the parents consent  
to your marriage with your Indian partner 
this is the first and the second is the  
affidavit of singleness or willingness to 
marry for you you know the filipino partner  
and next is Joint affidavit from the Indian and 
Filipino partner of how you met with each other  
and what are your plans in the future. In our 
case, we put there that we are planning to go  
to India and we are planning to go to india to 
settle here and start a new life and then plan  
our family like that this affidavit you need it 
to be notarized in the city hall and just get this  
authenticated by the DFA, so that you know you 
would be ready about it that's it those are those  
are the requirements so the processing time would 
be three working days three to five working days  
and the fee is this 590 plus 50 but actually the 
fee is 660 pesos these requirements i just copied  
it from their website i will provide the link for 
it you go check it out now let's go to the process  
first you have to collect all of the documents of 
of course with two photocopies of each if you can  
do it make an extra photocopy of it provide one 
extra photocopy if in case you know to get all  
ready the next is go to the Indian embassy in 
Manila and seek for the consular services for  
affidavit of legal capacity in this case like 
since I'm from Province we flew all the way to  
Manila to go to India embassy with my partner you 
have to take note that the Filipino partner can go  
inside of the embassy with you unless you guys are 
married you cannot go together there the indian  
national can just go directly there just provide 
some ID and things like that but the filipino  
partner can't go inside she needs to go via bus 
there's a bus specifically for people going inside  
of the embassy for some business and 
then they would need to stop a checkpoint  
show the valid IDs and you have also to pay for 
the entry well you know your Indian partner can  
just process it alone but it's up to you guys if 
you want to process it together so the third step  
in the third process is once inside the officer 
will give you the receipt of what you need then  
they'll ask for the documents if they'll give you 
a receipt of what you need what are you seeking  
for the consular services so in this case, you 
have to put you know the level capacity to get  
married to get the legal capacity so remember that 
here everything needs to be in order if you don't  
want any hassle prepare 2 photocopies of each 
and separate each in order so that it would be  
easier for them to check like because once they 
ask for that single document and you are juggling  
your documents where is it where is that uh 
they can just say to you like come back again if  
everything is ready so you don't want that right 
because especially if you are from province it's  
a lot of hassle going back and you know forth
In our case, everything was smooth I mean  
yeah, my husband is so meticulous how can it not 
be like everything were in order and before the  
officer could finish her... I mean his words, like 
he already gave the document like in order  
the next process is after they checked 
it after you check all of the documents  
they'll give you a letter like it's just 
a one piece of paper like an A4 size  
bond paper letter and where you write your name 
you will just need to fill out the necessary  
details like the name of the indian national 
applying for the legal capacity and then the name  
of you know your wife to be and any details there 
this letter is your affidavit of the capacity like  
it's actually looking like this like it's not you 
know typed or things like that your handwriting  
is there so it's just like literally a piece of 
paper so what will happen is they will just stamp  
it and then it's done that's the legal capacity 
but you know the requirements is also a lot so  
the next person this will be the last they'll 
give you the receipt to bring with you after  
five days so the payment is 660 pesos like after 
five days they will give you your document so but  
in our case they released it after three days so 
be sure to process it in weekdays or otherwise  
you will have to wait for the weekend you don't 
want that right so now we're done you guys can  
skip this or not but as always I give tips and 
advices. I asked my husband what there would be  
his advices or tips that he can think of during 
the process of this legal capacity to get married  
so number one tip that he told me is to arrange 
the documents in order from the site requirements  
like in the site they have those requirements, 
right? Just arrange your document according to  
that order because they specifically ask for you 
to arrange it if it's not in order they will just  
Shoo you and then they will entertain the other 
person just arrange it in order the next tip is to  
make sure to have two foot copies of each if you 
can add another photocopy of it just an extra it  
won't be a waste anyway because in the future you 
will need this photocopies anyway so the next uh  
tip is that Indian nationals should carry an ID
with you like you know valid ID to enter in the  
Indian embassy like my husband specifically um 
emphasized this that when he enters in the indian  
embassy don't use your passport to present it on 
the security guard or things like that because  
that's a mistake on his part don't give your 
passport as an id just give a separate valid ID  
which you have when you go to another country don't 
just give it to people your passport and things  
like that so anyway that's all that we can think 
of and if you have any questions just comment in  
the comment section below and we'll try our best 
to answer it all according to our experience  
thank you for watching and I hope this uh 
informational video helps you if you're planning  
to get married then best wishes from us and I hope 
we'll see each other again in the next video bye
