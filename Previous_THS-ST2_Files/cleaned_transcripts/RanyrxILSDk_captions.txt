hi my name is josie and this is Puerto princesa
so welcome back or welcome if you're new 
here my name is josie welcome to my channel  
today we are here in pouerto princessa in palawan 
and normally if you were to come here you're gonna  
go do snorkel in honda bay you're going to 
go see the fireflies you're going to go to  
the underground river but we don't have that 
long this time we're only here for a couple of  
hours so we're going to show you what you 
can do here in Puerto princesa with just  
a few hours to make it worth your while let's go 
have a look so the first stop is you know it has  
to be coffee so we're here at the fat goat 
we're gonna have a coffee to start the day  
we're gonna head on to some breakfast after that 
it's okay that's all right all right thank you  
maybe after two to three hours oh okay oh thank 
you that's when we're leaving all right thank you  
so much okay so we actually heard that happens a 
lot um if you heard that i don't think i got it in  
time she just told us were ordering coffee and the 
second she started to make the coffee she said the  
power went out and apparently you were telling me 
that that's actually quite common here it happened  
this morning in our hotel but our hotel has a like 
a back up generator so it was fine within like 10  
minutes it came back on um so we thought i thought 
that she could just start the coffee in like a  
minute or so um but she said no two to three hours 
so i'm not sure what we could even do today with  
that because most of the things we want to do have 
that so let's have a look so why we couldn't get  
our coffee from the fat goat we're just now 
on our way walking to the next destination  
hoping to find some coffee along the way but i 
have noticed that there are so many tricycles  
or tri-bikes or something around here because 
there's no like grabs or public transport so  
they're everywhere i'm sure that they would cost 
a little bit more but we're just kind of trying  
to keep today to walking i think we're gonna try 
for some breakfast it's breakfast time well it's  
actually lunch time but it's breakfast time for us 
so my first impression so far of puerto princesa  
is that it is really hot it's hot everywhere 
don't get me wrong but it is super hot today  
i've also noticed there's more like local stores 
local houses local roads like this this is really  
really cool i really like it oh basketball hoop 
yeah i feel like we're in someone's like community  
we've got clothes hanging up to drive we've got 
a basketball hoop we've got dogs look at this dog
hi can i pat thank you
oh you're so cute
they're so little
do they have a name
thank you so
i love much that was so cute that was the coolest 
thing puppies are so cute i love them what a good  
start to the walk hey okay so we found a second 
coffee shop hopefully this one has the power on
okay so we're here at the coffee shop essential 
first stop of the day i think for every day  
whether it's on camera for me or not i've been 
waiting a lot for this it's really hot outside  
it's really cool inside and i've got an isolate 
what more could you want the power just went out  
here too we're bringing the power outages with us 
every time we where we walk through the city okay  
so that was the coffee place just down there and 
the restaurant that we're gonna go to is literally  
just across the road which is how we found that 
coffee roaster this is really pretty there's  
like greenery everywhere but it's not so built 
up as other places like manila and everything  
like that obviously and i like it it's got such 
a charm about it i think i like those places  
just as much if not more because it's so unique 
so we've actually gone to a couple of places and i  
think we might be a little bit late for cylog but 
if this place doesn't have sea lock it definitely  
has sissic so we're going to try one or the other 
today this one is tia isling's filipino restaurant  
let's try here okay so she brought out the drinks 
we both got a can i got a can of juice i forgot a  
can of coke zero there were 55 filipino pesos 
each and then she brought out the pork sissig  
and it's just sizzling away it's just sizzling 
it's so cool and and this one was 255 filipino  
pesos and then we also got a cup of rice just one 
cup which i believe was 25 pesos as well so all  
together it was this i'm putting it on my plate 
right now i'm putting a bit of the pork sissig  
on my plate and i'm grabbing some of the rice 
i'm going to try them both at the same time  
i'm looking at it now and i don't know if 
i've ever seen anything like this before it's  
basically like a big mince it looks like a 
big mince but i'm seeing different like colors  
i'm seeing different kinds of the pork like 
obviously there's a little bit more fat in  
here than the other parts yeah i'm interested to 
see what it tastes like isn't this just the cutest  
it's like a little bus oh it's a cheating you're 
right and it says philippines yeah i love that  
all right here we go we've got the pork cystic 
with some rice on my spoon fork or my fork  
smells good it smells like garlic oh it's very 
mushy it's it's not crispy at all when you bite  
into it it basically all blends into one bit of 
meat one sophie to me which then blends into the  
rice as well not chewy pretty much dissolved in 
my mouth i actually didn't expect that at all i  
expected that to be crispy and like crunchy and 
like having to chew through it that isn't what i  
expected like at all it's got a lot of flavor in 
it the texture isn't something that i would love  
um i prefer like the crunchy crackling thing 
but the flavor's a bit of nice i like the  
flavor you love pork though so let's see what 
you think some sort of maybe an intestine of  
some sort i don't know maybe you could let us 
know in the comments it kind of feels like a  
like a porridge of pork if that makes sense like 
porridge consistency but you can definitely taste  
like just a mixture of all the different cuts in 
there together i really like that michael's about  
to tell me what's in this because i didn't want 
to know until afterwards it's not my favorite i'm  
not gonna lie like it's not bad i just think the 
texture of the soft meat just isn't really for me  
um but michael loves pork and he said that 
he really likes it but the flavors of it are  
really nice the garlic and everything like that i 
just think like the way that it feels in my mouth  
isn't the best i'm a big texture person so that 
makes it up for me a lot there's onions and chili  
peppers in there which gives it the taste it's 
got chicken liver in there which means you've  
eaten chicken living out oh there's minced pork 
in there which you would have normally we've eaten  
a million times before and then there's cuts 
from the pig's ear um and from the pig's face  
different like the face is quite fatty 
so there's a fatty bits in the pig's face
really so i'm glad that i know that i've tried 
something i wouldn't normally have tried before  
that's for sure i've been loving other filipino 
foods that we've had so far i've loved the fresh  
lumpia i've loved the banana q i've loved the 
pork adobo we had as well and i loved the beef  
curry curry as well i'm going to leave the video 
where i eat all those things in the description  
below so if you want to see me try them check out 
those videos after this one but michael seems to  
like it he's finishing it off really quickly okay 
so that's it for the [ __ ] now right now we're  
on the way to plaza cuatel and that has a pretty 
historic meaning here in water princess so that  
also has some ties to world war ii i'll tell you 
a little bit more about that when we get there  
i've just learned as much as i could about it i'm 
new to all of this stuff and all of the background  
to do with these countries but that's what i do 
with you i explore it as i go and learn new things  
along the way you teach me more than i am so 
appreciative for in the comments below as well so  
let's get to this place and there's a really 
nice quarter princess sign right in front of  
us in front of the water so the japanese had the 
prisoners here there were roughly 150 americans  
and a few filipinos as well and once they sort 
of got wind that they were going to lose the war  
they kept everyone underground in the 
underground tunnels right here and they  
basically just set the underground tunnels on 
fire and burnt everyone which is so completely sad  
apparently about 11 of them escaped and they 
don't know how or where or anything like that  
but we think that they just maybe escaped 
the tunnel somehow and got out of the fire  
um but you can see the underground tunnels here 
so that's pretty insane to think about i think  
there's a park over there that has the names as 
well of the people who are captive but so just  
come out of there and across the road we see 
some people playing basketball this is so cool  
i should play no i'm not that good if you 
have a team tell me in the comments below  
because apparently basketball is massive here 
so let me know what your team is michael likes  
76ers oh you got them on your hat hi so we just 
walked all the way through this really local  
um village to bayside we just arrived in bayside 
there's tri bay walk sorry bay walk and we're just  
right on the river on the ocean on the water 
right now and there's bikes everywhere i'm  
assuming you could like hire them if you'd like 
to drive around drive around right around on them  
there seems to be like restaurants here as 
well it's really hot today oh he's so cute
he's driven past me like five times so we'll say 
hi one day he's been like working off the courage  
he like rides past josie first time he didn't 
smile so he found me like look at that then  
he looked at me and then the next one he smiled 
and he keeps just coming back around back around  
looking at her i think you might say hello soon 
he waved at me that time he waved away you're on  
the camera no no no he didn't stay healthy jog 
exercise be happy smile relax enjoy life i like  
it so we're just walking down this really busy 
street here um i'm not sure which street it is  
but we kind of came out from the bay and we ended 
up sort of here and there's a lot going on there's  
tricycles there's shopping centers there's hotels 
there's like market roads down there you can see  
so i've noticed looking at these all these 
tricycles that they all have different names  
printed on the back of them sounds 
like pauline someone's like juan  
some of them are other things so if you know why 
they have different names let me know is it like a  
license plate number but their name i'm not sure i 
find it really interesting um there's only i think  
one big mall correct me if i'm wrong the sm mall 
and we're heading there now just to have a look  
and then we might find some fresh street food if 
we can as well i'm pretty full from the [ __ ]  
still so we'll see but there's a lot going on 
on this street that's for sure there's pads  
over here cars over here there's more shorts 
over here there's a lot to get here there's  
premise drugstores a jolly bee obviously there's 
always a jolly bean no matter where you go here  
so i was thinking i was like wow this town 
has this big sm all right but it's the biggest  
like city town in palawan so it makes sense so 
we're just going to have a look around show you  
a little bit of the mall get a drink hopefully 
find a drink yes i would love a drink and then  
hopefully find some street food or something 
on the outside that we can have a chew on  
for a little snack and then afterwards tonight 
we're actually doing something really special  
so stick around and find out what that is or not 
you'll have to see so the mall we just came out of  
the mall and the mall's back there and where 
we stayed is literally across the road it's  
right there i'm still honestly quite full from 
this this sig a little bit earlier but there's  
all of these like street food carts on the side as 
well literally outside of our hotel over there so  
oh what's that that's banana 
with uh banana yes what's that
what what's in that flour and
yeah i'll try that how much is it 10 pesos 
10. oh there's a tenner in in my front here

it's like a flat pancake kinda it looks like a  
potato salad yeah like a potato scallop you're
