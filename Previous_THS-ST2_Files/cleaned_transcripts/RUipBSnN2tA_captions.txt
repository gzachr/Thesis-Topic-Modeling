we've never tried them before it's 
articulation we're doing some crazy jumps off
good morning and welcome to sikkio island everyone 
after what should have been a two-hour travel day  
yesterday turned into a 12-hour full day of 
travel geographically the island is close  
to cebu island but we had to take numerous buses 
tricycles and ferries just to get to the island
we are currently headed south walking towards 
liloan port we are going to be getting a ferry  
to sticky ho today really excited about this 
one uh we've seen it on youtube and it doesn't  
look like somewhere that most people tend to go 
when they come to the philippines i may be wrong  
but we haven't heard of it before so really 
excited yeah the aim is just to flag a bus down  
when they're going past now they are running 
because we've seen one come the other way but  
yeah when it comes we're gonna try to flag it down 
and jump on if not we're going to miss the ferry
yes we got it
little onward yeah it's awesome
thank you so much okay we've picked the vlog 
tickets we're just getting on the ferry now
okay so far so good now we've just got a kill in 
this pretty long queue to get two tickets for the  
next ferry okay guys we have been killing i'm 
not even lying for about five hours for a ferry  
ticket absolutely crazy because it's holy week and 
it's the long weekend it's just crazy busy don't  
know what time we get in but we were gonna have 
like an afternoon planned explorer in sikkio but  
i think that's fun it is what it is we can't do 
that so let's get some food it's been a long day  
i can't wait to get into the hotel now we woke 
up this morning we rented our little bike here
from this one the name we normally do we have 
to think go on well we've come to our first  
stop of the day which is palaton beach now 
there's two beaches really really close to  
each other there's paleton beach and there's 
kang bisio beach i may i probably said that  
wrong i'm copying off google maps yeah let's go 
check it out someone else got a drone up in yeah  
jail us we will be getting the drone soon yeah 
but even from hue the water looks incredible
oh it's actually quite cold i was 
expecting to be really warm let's go and  
try that yeah i've had some bad weather the last
sunny day and there's hardly no clouds in the sky 
one thing i've noticed about the philippines even  
though we've only been to two beaches this one 
and the one in mouldwall there's a lot of coral  
so it seems to be really good for like snorkeling 
scuba diving maybe further out yeah um as compared  
to i don't make a comparison to thailand but in 
thailand you've just got like beaches where you  
would just sort of relax and swim and yeah the 
car is actually really close to the show as well  
so even if you were in a strong swimmer and you've 
never been snorkeling around with that before  
you could easily do it here and still be 
touching the floor like with a couple of  
steps in but it's only up to our knees and the 
coral is probably only another five steps away
there's also a few different sort of shops 
along the beachfront where you can pick up  
beers or drinks we might do food 
as well definitely got coconuts
okay so guys one thing we've noticed 
about the philippines is they have  
coconuts everywhere there's coke and 
trees absolutely everywhere as well  
and they just serve them on the side of the road 
or in a little hot on the beach we've never tried  
them before so we've picked one up we're hoping 
we like it and it was only 60 pesos which is less  
than a pound we've never actually tried coconut 
water from like a boat or back home either i  
never have any of you i never have no can you 
give it a first try it doesn't smell like much
i've never tasted anything like that before no 
it's a cold you've got a like proper suck to  
get it up i'd love that's the straw it could be 
the straw there's a paper straw it's not cold no  
no no i thought it was going to be 
cold oh my god oh my gosh it's so heavy
oh okay that's not what i expected that's not 
what i expected either this isn't so heavy  
i thought it was going to be way 
sweeter yeah it's just it tastes  
like flavored water almost like a flavor yeah 
of water oh coconut flavored water i guess
it's pretty good though i was never the one to 
write up a song for just anyone eye i was always  
the one to find myself lost in more conversations 
all cause i've always been told that things will  
unfold if you keep on waiting but then you came 
along and proved me all wrong i was so mistaken  
cause you the pieces back together yeah you 
you take all my wrongs and make them better  
yeah you you're making me wanna try 
forever i feel so free on my sweet baby  
nice this place actually is and quite relaxing 
there's actually quite a few people here  
um there's lots of food places as you've 
just seen but we've got loads more stops  
we want to visit today because we are only on the 
island for a day so we're gonna head to the next
okay guys check out this view that we've 
got here and we're having food right here  
what a place for lunch look how big this 
pizza is that's my hand compared to it  
yeah really relaxing here what was the place 
called it was called trattoria carbonara and  
we literally just came across it as we were 
riding on the bike i think we found a good spot
i don't know if you can hear us because 
the water is so powerful but we've come to  
loving the sun falls loving the sun pole yeah 
you didn't have to pay anything together and it  
was just a little walk down through the forest 
and we've come across this little gem it does  
seem like there's quite a lot of water to come in 
because obviously the rain over the past few days  
there's a few people here they're obviously some 
cliff jumps and some wall strength jumps and stuff
basically the rocks have made these big 
pools and it seems to go keep going down  
like steps all the way down the river oh yeah 
in the middle of like a jungle it's awesome
yes we're just driving along and there's 
loads of bikes parked up so we decided to stop  
and check it out there's it's a 
place called the enchanted tree  
and there's a big like pond with loads of the fish 
in that fight to feed and eat all the dead skin  
so we paid 20 pesos each to get in and we're just 
kind of chilling having our feet eaten by fish but  
they're not like the ones you see like on holiday 
in europe they're probably like like defeat  
they're like big these ones are like the ones that 
we've had before they're like tiny tiny tiny ones  
loads of people here all very relaxingly soaking 
their feet can i say oh we're just laughing and  
it's particular show you the tree as well it's a 
proper cool tree yeah which we're gonna presume is  
the enchanted tree because it literally does look 
like something from a fairy tale doesn't it yeah
that's a pretty unique stop but we're gonna 
head to the next spot which is about 15  
minutes driveway so we're getting back on our 
little trusty bike that we haven't named yet we  
made it to carmel guy falls we think that's how 
you say here we probably say they're wrong but  
it's definitely the most popular spot of the day 
we feared this one before we yeah we have you  
do we've seen it online in a couple of adjust too 
yeah there's 135 steps to get down and it's quite  
slippery oh no there's a barrier so that's good 
yeah this is definitely the busiest spot we've  
been to today there's quite a few people here 
there's loads of people swimming and there's also  
two rope swings there's a smaller one and there's 
a larger one we're doing some crazy jumps off
so
i didn't realize how big the place actually was 
so we've got the main pool with the two big rope  
swings down the ball down and then there's 
about five pools up until this top deck and  
it's quieter up here but a bit more shallow 
and then there's a rope swing on the next one  
there's a cliff jump on the next one down 
and then you've got the main one there with  
the two big rope swings it looks as if there's 
another pool right on the bottom as well but  
yeah it's actually really cool i didn't realize 
how big it was but it is awfully crowded because  
it's a holiday it is good friday 
today there's lots of people here  
if you can get this place unlike a 
quiet day you could have so much fun
as you can see we are back on the bike 
now uh the falls are really really cool  
definitely recommend checking out if 
you're here we're just heading now  
to find a spot for sunset i'm pretty 
sure we'll catch it in time we'll see
okay guys we're back in the hotel 
room now we'll give you a quick tour  
just to show you where we're staying we're 
staying in a place called james holmes day  
i think it works out to be about 14 15 
pounds a night excuse the mess over here  
but we've got a double bed we've 
got this one just chilling here
uh i'm just editing a video here and then 
that's the mess but we've got some cabinet space  
and then this is the bathroom and the best thing 
we've got a hot water shower but anyway that's our  
one day of exploring sick you're done we didn't 
actually get towards the sunset either we were  
planning on it but as it was getting close to the 
time the sky was just all clouds so we didn't get  
to catch good sunset this time but i'm sure 
we will at some point in the philippines but  
anyway we are going to end it here we are moving 
on to the next island tomorrow hopefully we have  
a nice easy travel day not a 12 hour one again if 
you are new around here please hit subscribe give  
us a thumbs up if you enjoyed the video and we 
will see you again hey that's rude tomorrow you
