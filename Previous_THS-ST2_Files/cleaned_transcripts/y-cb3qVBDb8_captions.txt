Hi mga palangga! Good evening so time here is quarter to 8:00 in the evening..We are here in our barbecue house
to film.. I know you all know that we are going to film our uk spouse visa experience
and this video is it's just a sit down video so I have
my husband with me
John: oh! we doing the visa video, are we?
Yes!
okay..visa video!
so I have my husband
with me to talk about
Can you move the camera closer so they can see me better
talk about  our visa experience so
we will zoom you in first
move your camera dear
DEAR! that's it dear! C'mon you need to sit
properly Sir John
I'm sitting beautifully comfortably
this is the idea of having our barbecue house
End of our working day we can just
come and sit in here and relax and look
out and enjoy the evening and we're free
from flies and monsters sitting here we
have all the freedom of fresh air
marvelous right so what we're talking
about visas what is it we're going to
speak so a lot of you were asking or
suggesting if I could or we could make
our a story about our UK visa experience
so my John is here to talk about it
because he do most of it so here is the
handsome right all depends on the type
of visa and will be attacked by a fly
and you may say we have no flies and
they come to attack me what's it where is
Okay its just a fly
so we are we applied for a
spouse visa because we married in the
Philippines so the only experience we
can give you is
on the spouse visas okay so basically we
obviously went through all the motions
of doing everything if we're getting
married and we got married and then and
at that time we got married
Mia didn't have a passport so  we decided to wait until
we were married then she could apply for
her passport and put it in her married
name which does actually simplify things
when it comes to the visa causes there's no
two names different 
that's what we decided to do because
only take
how long did tell you to get the
passport.. three days  
you got to Manila okay you got to pay
the money yeah you've got to stop in the
hotel or whatever to do that but you
know there's different places as well
yeah there are different places but you
did there because you had to go to the
CFO
CFO...we have to do
the TB test,  English test so basically we
choose Manila to do everything yes
because everything was just in one city
and that was it so so basically and
prior to going
we made all the appointments for you to
go to CFO, passport office, TB test, an
English test basically so you was
actually in Manila for a week two weeks
yeah yeah we managed to get everything
crammed in in that period of time and
all done and dusted basically
once you've got your passport you
you are if you are married in the
Philippines and you want to come to the
UK quite a simple process providing you
meet all the requirements right and at
the time the requirements for us this is
just what we had to do don't quote me
this is a quote that you need this
because this is what this was 2015 we
are now three years down the line so you
would need to go into the UK government
website on the visa section to find out
what we require requirements are to
qualify to apply for a visa so I clearly
make you know
emphasizes always check to the last
minute before you apply because things
are changing all the time okay so keep
that quite clear okay
right so basically what we did well
basically our requirements were.... you have
to have an income and paying tax on the
sum of eighteen thousand two hundred
pounds I think it was or a 600 pound one of
the other then you have to have if you had a
child to come with you
You have an additional earnings of I think it was
another three or four thousand pounds
per child but don't quote me because I
could be completely wrong we don't have
the child we purely just 
ourselves so that was that so basically
we ..so you can do it on year earnings you
can do it just on if you've got savings
you must have savings over sixty
two and a half thousand pounds and that
most savings it must be what they call
liquid savings basically you've got
instant access to it it can be spent on
because you've got to have obviously
around thirty thousand or just under
thirty thousand pound per year to
support each other
in the UK I don't know why such a high
number but it is... but you don't have to
do with all you saving you can do
part savings and part solid because if
you're not earning eighteen thousand
salary say you're only earning 15,000..you can used your fifteen thousand salary and
then there is a calculation for how much
saving you need to make the numbers up
you would need to speak to someone who
actually does the visa process who
actually understands what they are and
they would actually tell you but the
simplest way is if you've got savings
easiest way to do it on your savings or
if you're a hundred percent employed by
somebody and paying tax on eighteen
thousand two hundred pounds then you
will have no problem get to the visa
another thing is you've got to provide
the information on where you're going to
live ie do you own your property if you
have got children it must have so
many bedrooms I think it's a minimum of
two you can be in rented accommodation
because a lot of people I know in the UK
providing it fills the requirement
everything would be fine and basically
we actually used a company down in
London who specialized in visas because
we've never done the process before we
thought it would be easier yes it cost
us a thousand pounds just for this
company to do it but knowing what I
know now I could actually quite do it
simple in myself but if you let the
experts do it they are updating all the
time on different legislations and
changes in the rules so in many ways
it's advisable to use those because them
guys will not submit an application form
unless it is correct
because your visa will cost you just
your visa alone over a thousand pounds now
if your application is wrong and it's
submitted you still
to pay your money and if it's rejected
you lose your money
so these company visa specialists they don't
allow any submissions until everything
is correct in place basically so it's
worth spending the extra money with them
guys and they'll guarantee it will be
okay for you so that's what we did and
obviously we have to supply all the
information they just give us a list of
what they want... we give them all that
they fill out the form they put it in
the right places because the form must
be 20-30 pages long it is massive
 that was all done.... you do have to
pay a NHS fee which I think saving my
memory is correct was about 850-900 pounds
which anyone asked to pay coming into
the UK they've got to contribute that to
the NHS so you are not using government
funds basically which is fair it is
right which I completely agree with so
basically the time you have done your
visa you've paid for the company because
these companies will charge anywhere
from six seven hundred pound to twelve
hundred pound we will lucky cost us
six I think or seven... visa at the time
cost us was over a thousand pounds and
then NHS so basically you're
looking two thousand five hundred two
thousand eight hundred pound that's what
it cost was to do the visa process and
the company who did the visa they did
ask me when would we like the visa to
start from.... now this was in October when
we applied I think it was
sorry November
yes... when we applied and they said oh it gonna be into the next year I said no
I said can you please put down
I think it was ....
yeah December 30 2015 they said you will
not get it... I said please put it on the
form let's see what happens within less
than well I think was about three weeks
we received notification we had got the
visa and it was granted and which
allowed Mia to come to the UK on New Year's  Eve
yesI arrived here new years eve
that is exactly what we did all I can
say is the authorities are there just to
make sure everything is right..
they don't tried to be make things difficult to
stop people coming in they just want you
to you know fulfill their requirements
you will be looked after and basically
from Mia arriving here we had one or two
things to do..... for collecting a biometric
card and everything we should do through
the post office...but it was all there ready
waiting for us everything was just as
they said would be very very simple to
do and all I can say is I hope anyone
out there is gonna apply..... take there adivse
make sure you got  all the
requirements if there's anything
is a little bit unsure
about something if it's not right you're
good feeling is telling you it's not
right so make sure everything is correct
before you submit the form and you don't
lose your money but use a proper company
and you'll be fine so and obviously Mia
had to do certain things I'll let her
speak to you now about that what she had
to do when she was in Manila well your
English test
yeah well...you need to talk about the English test
Well! the english test was minimum minimum requirement for the
English test was A1...but if you take an A1
when you come to the UK in
two-and-a-half years time you've got to
redo it but if you take a B1... ..B1 sorry
YES! you only have to take one
test which Mia's has done was B1(I took the B1 sorry if John says B2)..
and the difference between the A1 and the B1 is....
there's not much difference... there is ten minutes difference in
the test isn't there? --yes that is only
10 minutes more talking and that is it...
Yes... it covers only speaking and listening so
don't  be worried about it
and I think it cost us roughly when
we take the test
it was 14,000php in that time so yeah but I
don't know how much is it now because it
was way back 2015 and yeah English test
is one of the requirements and also you
have to do your TB test right yes now
you do you've got to go to Manila to do
the TB test I think
They have Cebu now I think.... you got to do the TB test which is an x-ray
Was it x-ray you did? -Yes just for the lungs to see make sure
you clear from TB but that is all you
have to do to get your visa but when you
come to the UK...... you have to have a
further TB test which they ask you to go
to the medical center and they actually
give you a little injection(they inject it in the skin)
yeah just to screen to see if you've
actually been vaccinated for TB to be on the safe....if not they would actually
give you the vaccination
well anyway Mia pass it with the flying colours
had been vaccinated so that was a TB
side and now then I know nothing about
the CFO for so you need to explain
So yeah! the CFO has to types the certificate and the stamp, I dont know I forgot all about it LOL
no there is certificate and the stamp
Ah right! NO! You just mislead them
.So what then, then talk about it!
You to CFO and you have to do seminar right and
the seminar is all about what women's
rights are(sort of sorry we forgot about it now)  and I don't really know how
you did tell me about it but
they're simple seminar wasn't it?
everybody passes it you know it's not an
issue but you've got to sure that you've
attended the seminar once
you've done the seminar you receive a
certificate  from the CFO but
once you have got your visa on the way
out you can you can get it in the
airport but you must double check this one
there is a CFO office in
the airport of Manila and you need to get this
like a certificate which is stuck into
your passport I will I will put the
picture on the screen okay I will put a
picture on the screen so you will know
what we mean because it's been a long
I've never seen my CFO but then that's
one of the requirements yes yeah but
yeah and then that was it so that was
the the main thing really was the
English test the TB test and the CFO
that was Manila things you had to do or
requirements and then obviously you did
your passport at the same time and that
was it
so the proof of relationship yeah
okay just a quick one
when you start a relationship with
someone you know.. say an example aguy
from the UK wherever
and everything's looking good and you
think everything's gonna work out what
you certainly do....the very first day you meet them you need to make
some kind of documentation example if
you say you meet in Cebu or Manila what
you want to do is make sure you go to
places of interest where you can
actually physically take a photo or like a
monument us in the middle of Manila or
something in Cebu or up in  mountain top or or
something in the city that everybody
recognizes you know we we actually went to....
town in Mactan
and there's all the Mactan sculptures and that there
you know everything we
did we documented..... hotel... all our flights
all our Skype history..... viber.... I don't
think you need quite as much on some of
this stuff now....yeah well
obviously we obviously we did all our
wedding pictures everything and  we
end up with a marriage certificate as
well you know so in general and just
make sure you leave a paper trail of all
the things you've done together and
that's it you know that's our experience
on spouse visa if you're looking to
marry in the UK obviously then you would
come on a fiancee visa which to be honest with
you I think the requirements are similar
but I don't know you would really have
to check out yourself I don't want to
qoute anything because I don't want to
mislead anyone so all I say is happy
reading happy hunting and all the
information you require is on our
government website for fiancee visa or
spouse visa so anyway good luck in your
future applications
so bye for now and I hope it has
been a bit of interest I have not been
too boring for you guys out there you
know boy end of the day probably been a
bit little bit serious about it
but you need to be because you
know it's a thing that needs to be sort
of dumped correctly so you have no
problem we do we've heard of so many
horror stories about people having
problems getting a visa and the only
reason they have problems because they
don't meet the requirements have the
right ones thumbs up okay bye for now
so that's it for us today mga palangga
and I hope that you enjoy this video and bye
