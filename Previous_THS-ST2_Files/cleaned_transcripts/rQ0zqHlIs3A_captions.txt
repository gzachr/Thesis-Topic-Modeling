today we're trying filipino food 
for the first time let's dig in
all right guys we are back trying food from 
another country that we have never tried  
before this yeah never ever tried this it smells 
amazing cannot wait to dig in but we are trying  
filipino food and oh my goodness where has this 
been all my life i haven't even tried it but the  
smell is just like i don't know yeah the whole 
way home with this stuff in the car is like oh  
my even at the restaurant picking it up it's like 
oh man this ever smelled good so before we even  
start bear with us we're gonna do our best to 
not butcher any of the names we have our little  
cheat sheet here with a little description um but 
please feel free to let us know below if we have  
missed said anything or we've gotten 
something a little wrong we are doing our best  
yes first time we've tried it and if you think of 
anything else you want us to try yeah let us know  
in the comments yeah let us know below if you miss 
anything or any other food to try from anywhere  
in the world let us know we'll see what we can 
do to try it we were recommended this stuff by  
the restaurant they said if you've never tried it 
before try these things yeah when i called up and  
maybe put my order and i said we've never tried 
for the peanut food before what should we try  
and uh we got these items that's right so we are 
trying adobo pork the bear with me guys singy gone  
with pork in it and shanghai rolls hey rice oh 
and we got some white rice to go with the adobo oh  
it's so exotic so exotic i wanted to get a little 
crazier but eric's like kelly let's start slow  
down let's let's exactly let's dip her tone in the 
water before we jump right in and it just gives us  
more opportunities to try it again yeah exactly 
the shanghai roll would be the appetizer yes so  
really quickly for anybody out there who does not 
know what they are sorry guys i don't know tell  
me shanghai is a filipino-style spring roll made 
of ground pork chicken or beef filling wrapped  
in thin crepes called lumpia wrappers the meat 
stuffed lumpia is rolled into a thin cylindrical  
shape cut into bite size lengths and deep fried to 
golden perfection sounds fantastic and for i think  
it came with 12 it was 9.95 that's it that alone 
for 12 pieces for nine bucks seem too bad really  
ready let's crack it open oh they're so cute 
and i don't mean this in like a condescending  
way they're actually really cute yeah well 
they're just there's tiny they're small yeah  
and i'm assuming again we're assuming that this 
little sauce goes with it looks like a plum sauce  
it does look like a thumbs up some sauce 
oh you guys if you could just smell this  
yeah it's definitely a plum sauce oh man 
come on guys let's go let's go let's go  
i'm waiting for you i'm gonna dip it in 
what's talking let's just do it first
first no this goes with it all right here 
we go i'll dip goes with it you can't i'm  
sure many people would be like you can't have 
the shanghai roll without the dip all right
wow oh it has a little bit of like tang oh 
wow but holy crap i'm gonna this is so good  
i'm gonna tear this apart quickly if i can show 
us the insides just to show you how and again  
i'm not saying this in a conditioning way but how 
basic it is but whatever seasoning is on that pork  
holy hannah montana even that's the dipping 
sauce is fantastic holy crap this is so good  
it's so good it's just like they are deep fried 
to like perfection like they are so nice and  
crispy but still like tender did you guys hear 
the crunch let's do one more bite for the crunch
oh man and you can just even pretty but 
even before i fit into it you just like take  
you could like smell it and taste 
in your mouth it's so good wow  
different sauce is amazing i'm not normally 
a huge pork fan but like whatever they season  
this with holy crap it's fantastic i'm sorry i'm 
so annoying but holy crap i'm not done dipping  
we got to move on we got lots more but don't 
worry there's like one more email there's nine  
more left to eat all right wow those shanghai 
rolls i'm good with those we try to make sure i  
think we need to divisible by three so there's no 
fights after we stop rolling um so next up we have  
the sing egon soup which i'll read again here 
in case anybody doesn't know singy gong is a  
filipino soup or stew characterized by its sour 
and savory taste it is most often associated with  
tamarind although it can use other sour fruits 
and leaves as a souring agent it is one of the  
more popular dishes in filipino cuisine fun 
fact the reason fun fact kelly did fun facts
mark with the graphic kelly fun fact the 
reason why it is called singing is that  
it was a translation to the english word stew 
which is true because of its method of cooking  
so some of the research i did basically 
it's kind of the equivalent of like  
our stew english stew okay north american stew 
but this is the filipino version filipino version  
we got a ginormous tub of it and we don't 
really want to divide it out in case we miss  
things so you know what guys we're 
just going all in on this soup  
um for this bowl it was twelve dollars and 
fifty cents canadian okay that's still not bad  
that's a price that's a big bowl of soup and i'm 
looking it looks like it's full of like food too  
yeah let's see what it looks like it looks like a 
hearty broth oh i don't want it to spill because  
they filled this oh my god like look at that right 
to the right of the brim they're like no spared  
also a little fast a little give her a little show 
them some of the sexiness in there look at that
this is a pork version yeah look at that this 
is the pork pork cinnamon holy crap in there  
see the flavor from the marrow and stuff look 
at it like they don't play with their pork  
no that's a serious chunk of pork in there 
oh my gosh and the fat part of the pork  
so it looks like there's some lettuce some 
onions some basic sort of super stew veggies  
i think we're for a treat here i think so this is 
amazing this might just be messy so what we'll do  
is we're probably not gonna be able to take this 
all at the same time so eric you just dig in  
no we'll just have to don't give 
your reaction yucky i'll hold back  
as best as possible i got a nice chunk 
of the broth a little bit of the veg here  
we might have to try the pork separately with 
uh yeah let's like plate put it on a plate  
but there is a lot in here holy crap ooh onions  
yeah i'll do the broth and then 
we can cut up the chicken pork
holy guacamole that's good yeah it's good it's 
fantastic it's got a root like it's really  
not it's not hot at all it's definitely sour but 
not i don't find it spicy at all no no it's it's  
not like a really strong sour flavor where it's 
like i love the sour the hot and sour steak you  
want to try pizza and meat so just really quickly 
while we're giving out the meat onto a plate  
another kelly fun fact okay sinigang is marked 
as a filipino comfort food it helps cool the  
body during hot conditions due to its tangy taste 
there are many variations of the dish and it can  
be prepared in any way depending on preferences 
singing gong can be easily adjusted in both  
quantity and quality so people actually eat this 
to cool down it's a comfort food yeah absolutely  
like stew in canada at least you know it's more of 
a winter food there's a lot of these bones in here  
get a little bit of the the broth i think you 
can dip the rice in there too if you wanted  
well we haven't got to the rice yet so when i put 
my order in i think the owner actually said uh  
noodles is more of a traditional side dish with 
this stuff i went with rice to start who put  
eric in charge of ordering all right it's good 
it's definitely a private size i think i'm not  
like i like it but the sour flavor to it not sure 
if this would be my first choice of things so far  
definitely not the egg roll the egg rolls 
are way better the shanghai rolls sorry are  
way better in my opinion i have to say i really 
like the sweet and sour part i like the sweet and  
sour soup when you go to like chinese food buffets 
i love it there um so i don't mind the taste it  
has a little bit of a tang but not like hot by 
any means but it's a little sour and that meat  
is like full of the butter so tender it's super 
tender yeah oh my god like it's even a little bit  
pink still no i love how tangy the soup is like 
it was good it's got so much flavor going on in  
here and i'm just used to like your basic broth 
chicken noodle soups around here yeah this is so  
different and so good such a mix of flavors i'm 
used to and i'm loving it well that was good i  
had a big chunk of fat on that pork oh baby that's 
my favorite part of the meat a nice big chunk of  
that baby that's what the flavor is okay eric we 
still have the main course i'm not done with this  
eric's just going in he hasn't spilled yet though 
i would just say that he literally almost just  
you gotta jinx me like that all right as much as 
we love this soup we need to get on to the main  
course because that is all this smells amazing but 
this main course okay last but most certainly not  
least is the adobo pork we have the pork version 
there's chicken versions from what i understand  
yep we got the pork i think there's i think there 
might be even a beef version beef where's the  
beef all right so this is adobo adobo is often 
called the national dish of the philippines and  
it's certainly the most famous filipino dish the 
flavor is created using vinegar soy sauce garlic  
bay leaves and black pepper mmm that sounds like 
an interesting mix of flavors in this thing it  
sounds really good yeah when i talked to the owner 
they said this was like one of their specialties  
yep adobo so really looking forward to 
this one so for this container here 11.95
like it sounds like it's heavy like when you put 
it down there like and it looks like it's full  
oh yeah oh that's a lot of points yeah so again 
pork on the little bones that's the ribs yeah  
i love that that's on the bone is that like 
yeah it's a little ribs oh weird they're like  
little short ribs so with this one we're gonna put 
like some rice and then a little bit of the rice  
so let's just get a spoon crazy 
sharp angle there's something  
there's something so good about just traditional 
plain sticky i love sticky white rice so  
is it somewhere yeah i mean sticky white whatever 
you take this out of the water he didn't need all  
the stew he took like ten pieces of pork i 
took a lot of pork there doesn't share it
pour some on top here there's 
some with on the bone oh nice
oh my gosh you guys this smells so delicious 
it does i can't even all right pork first time  
ever i'm gonna have some rice first i'm gonna just 
i'm gonna have the pork cheers everybody go yeah
i can taste that soy right away it's so good 
but i find it very subtle for the flavors  
it's really good no and the pork is so tender 
like fantastic i kind of got a fatty piece though  
what's wrong with that's the best part exactly 
a little junk in the trunk tastes delicious i  
love that but that pork is amazing i think my 
overall synopsis is kind of what you just said  
all the flavors are delicious but none are super 
overpowering no none of it's like full just like  
i'm a wimp when it comes in some foods because my 
stomach will kill me if i eat stuff that's like  
really spicy whatever none of this feels like it's 
gonna bother me at all like it was nice flavors  
but nothing overpowering nothing too harsh even 
the sour stuff had a little sourness to it but not  
over a pound where you know you could eat 
it i could eat a bunch of it and not be  
too uh grossed out or soured out i guess my 
favorite thing about my favorite thing is i'm  
soured out my favorite thing about this pork 
i think is that it's there's no sweetness to  
it at all it's all very like savory flavors here 
in north america we do a lot of barbecue sauces  
so we slather a lot of sugar on our meats there's 
none of that on this and it tastes fantastic yeah  
there's actually an excellent pointer because it 
it almost feels a little greasy yeah and not not  
that it's a bad thing but like you can almost feel 
like the grease of the meat and the bad broth and  
the pork and stuff it's it's it's fantastic but 
really it's like melts in your mouth like i said  
i was expecting not like and i don't say this 
and like i'm disappointed but i was expecting  
really strong flavors that i wasn't used to that 
might be like a little nervous trying because i  
don't you know i'm not used to it because here in 
north america we have very bland palettes uh but  
like i said this is really good and it's so good 
but it's subtle and it's like comfort food oh my  
god like i want i'm gonna eat this again just on 
my own oh i would definitely go back there again  
you're sharing all this i'm sorry oh no i mean you 
can go by your own the best part is we gotta go do  
another review for two more sandwiches so we got a 
lot of voodoo so before we wrap it up i just want
