so going back to the topic guys how can we get  
a tourist visa or visitors visa to South 
Africa if you have a Philippine passport  
there are four main topics I'll be talking 
about first is of course the requirements  
so you will find a full list of requirements from 
vfs global website which is on this link I just  
want to point out though that you need to make 
sure that your passport is valid for six months  
within the time of your estimated travel for 
example you want to travel on june make sure  
your passport is still valid until december of the 
same year there are also additional requirements  
that are not on the website but i was asked for 
when i first applied for my visitors visa so i  
was asked for a stamp certificate from the bank 
reflecting your balance your account balance  
and you'll also be asked to submit a letter  
providing the list of activities or outlining  
what activities you will be doing in South Africa 
you can let your sponsor make the letter or you  
can also write it yourself so just address it to 
the consulate writing what you wish to see and  
what you wish to do in South Africa when I first 
applied for my tourist visa that i also included  
a round-trip flight although at this point I'm 
not very sure if you really have to do that or  
it is safe or it is advisable for you to do that 
due to the whole international travel restrictions  
of course we know that at this time it's not 
that easy to to make plans for the future because  
anytime the airlines or any country can 
close they can do another lockdown and just  
it's crazy so i'll leave it all up to you if you 
want to confirm your flights already but at this  
point i would not really recommend doing that step 
two after you gathered all your requirements you  
can submit it personally to their office so vfs 
global in the Philippines has two offices one in  
cebu and one in manila however for South African 
visas we can only submit our requirements to the  
manila office unfortunately they do not process 
a South African visas in Cebu office so again  
their office is located in China Roces 
avenue which is this is the full address  
there is no need for you to book an appointment 
you can submit it personally in fact that's how  
they want it to be processed you need to submit 
all the requirements personally at their office  
make sure before you go there 
that you downloaded a scanner  
barcode scanner because they will ask you 
to scan something before they even let you  
enter the office and also make sure you have 
all the requirements ready including the sign  
from the fulfilled or completed application form 
let's talk about waiting time or processing time  
when I first applied for my tourist visa way 
back 2017 I mean 2018 I actually waited for  
approximately a week and then I got my 
a text or notification that my visa is ready  
or my passport is ready for collection I just 
want to give you additional pointers to consider  
so due to the lockdown in manila when the vfs 
global reopened sometime in october of last year  
they only allowed submission of requirements on 
tuesdays and thursdays i'm not 100 if they're  
still doing the same thing or I would suggest that 
you give them a call first before you go to their  
office and that's pretty much it guys so just 
make sure that you have all the requirements ready  
prepare your barcode scanner on your phone 
and also make sure that regarding your bank  
statement that it's not more than seven days from 
the day that you submitted all your requirements  
and obviously you need to wear masks um 
just have your own pen if they let you  
sign something just make sure you have all 
things with you handy alright so i hope this  
quick video helped you guys and if you have 
any questions feel free to comment down below  
i'll answer all your questions as soon as i can so 
take care guys see you on the next video bye bye
you
