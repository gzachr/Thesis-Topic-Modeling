meal from the Philippines I have made pancit

me with the upcoming pork adobo recipe I have 
already received your emails with the recipe

your recipe to my parents so that's gonna be  
super exciting they're gonna try your recipe 
so that's really nice we're cooking together  
we already have the bawang at sibuyas and 
the chicken stock we also use some soy sauce
a brown sugar I find it always interesting how 
you cut the carrots I think everybody has its  
own way of cutting I will make thin slices like 
this same with the Baboy cut it in small pieces  
we make those nice and crispy we also gonna 
add some repolio give it a nice little green
Pogi is already hungry

while the pork is getting crispy I will 
add the carrots time for the sibuyas
Okay so one is next but I mean by one
some beautiful maganda soy sauce
add brown sugar
it's gonna caramelize nicely oh this smells 
so good I'm gonna divide this over two woks  
because the volume is gonna be a little bit too 
much and we're gonna add the pancit Canton as  
well as a little bit of bihon I'm transferring 
half of this the new Wok man I put them both on  
the same heat okay now I'm adding a little bit of 
tubig to both same amount approximately also here
then I'll add the repolio okay divide this
both have approximately the same amount 
as you can see they're on a low fire I'm  
also adding half of the chicken stock for 
extra flavor both will get the pancit Canton  
I have some nice freshly chopped parsley here
