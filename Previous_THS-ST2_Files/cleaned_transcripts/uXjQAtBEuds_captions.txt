you know it's tough when kids call you

single you know and she raised both of
us

because she reminded us every [ __ ]
day

tell us that just me and my sister just
playing in the room
and playing around and then my mom would
just come into the room and go i just

that's how tough my mom was i remember
one time i was at a shoe store and i was
[ __ ] up the shoe wall you know the
shoe display wall
[ __ ] up just putting shoes all over
the place right and the salesman saw me

10. my mom parked around the corner she
was like hey

mom's accent oh you want to expect the
manager
and my mom goes oh that's funny

your country and i speak two languages

right he's like you know what i don't
need to hear this [ __ ]

kid and get the [ __ ] out of my store
right so my mom started cursing back

together but my mom takes whatever curse
word she knows
and throws him at you he's like get the

[Music]

which is spelled h-a-n-h-t-i-e-n
remember that uh i once had a teacher
in high school hawaii teacher
who was reading through roll call and
i knew she was about to get to my name
because she had that like
ethnic pause
and before i could say anything she
looked at those letters
h-a-n-h-t-i-e-n and
said out loud is there a hank
tina in the room
hank tina is there hank tina here
that means this grown-ass adult
who's been given the power to mold young
minds
looked at those letters h-a-n-h-t-i-n
and thought to herself
this is unfamiliar to me
you know what i'm just gonna combine the
nicknames of my favorite two american
names
henry and christina hank tina hank tina
hank tina's not a name anywhere
that's not a name that exists anywhere
in the world
unless you're like the child of
progressive parents from small town

come on scoot find the gender expression
that fits
you scoot hank tina
scoot you love it when i say scoot

shane wang is chinese
[Applause]
what's up everybody thank you so much
for being here my name
is chang wang sometimes uh when i tell
people that they're like
wow that is perfect for pursuing
stand-up comedy
i'm like yeah but first i was trying to
pursue childhood
you know it's tough when kids call you
names
it's always worse when they just use
your name
even recently i was making a reservation
for this hotel in arkansas
i gave the guy information it was all
good i told him my name is shane wayne
he said that's funny
you don't sound like that
i was like my bad
i'm sorry if i don't meet your racist
expectations
i'm sorry if i don't sound like a
complete stereotype arkansas
you on the other hand doing a really
good job
so uh i was hanging out with my younger
brother recently and we got into a
conversation about how great an older
brother i am i brought up the topic
um and he was being sarcastic
because he had remembered a game that i
had invented when i was six and he was
four
called the belt game um
you see i found my dad's belt and
invented a game
where the rules were you had to hit each
other with the belt
and uh that's as far as i'd gotten at
that point
now i'm the older brother right so i got
to go first
so i took the belt and i whipped him
in the eye
and he started screaming and crying like
a
four-year-old and then my mom walked in
and to my surprise she also knew how to
play the belt game
i was like mom how do you know how to
play the belt game i just made it up i
mean
apparently she was an old pro
because she would take the belt and she
would hit me across the back with it
and she said now now you know how your
brother feels
and i look back at her and i said no i
don't i hit him in the
eye that was the end of belt game
and a much needed return to nerf
i grew up in a predominantly white
suburb and
when you're one of the few asian
american kids people say some pretty
weird stuff to you
and by weird i mean like entertainingly
racist not like oh my god that was so
bad
but oh my god that was so creative how
did you come up with that so i was in
high school shopping for tankini's at
the local tj maxx
yes ladies tankinis because i wanted to
be modest but flirty
you know show an inch of my skin so
people are like what's the rest of her
stomach look like
and so i was shopping for tankinis and i
felt a tap on my shoulder
and i turned around and this white woman
goes
are you michelle kwan
and i love picturing this woman seeing
me across the way
thumbing through tankini's and she's
like oh my god
oh my god
is that is that two-time olympian
five-time world figure skating champion
michelle quan
in my favorite tj maxx oh my god
no one else in the store knows no one
else in the store knows okay
i'm gonna go talk to her i'm gonna go
talk to her
i didn't say anything right away because
that's never happened to me before
and so in my hesitation she goes
are you michelle quan
i don't want to speak for michelle
but i feel like i'd know my own name if
it was michelle
you wouldn't have to slow it down for me
when i look back on that moment though i
really can't
i can't blame her because i was shopping
for tankinis like this
for all the quenetics out there that's
what we call ourselves
it was weird growing up in the midwest
uh with my situation because like
i find that my life now is just a
never-ending guessing game
of where are you really from you know um
it's just
exhausting to get it all the time like i
was at a party recently and a guy i did
not even know approached me from across
the party and without even knowing my
name
the first words out of his lips were i'm
sorry but what um
what kind are you like i'm some sort of
unmarked dessert on a buffet bar
you know like it was just that casual
and it's so fresh it's like fine i don't
mind having the conversation i don't
mind answering the questions
it just never turns into an interesting
conversation
you know like every single day it's just
like oh i'm from south korea and they're
like oh cool i taught english in south
korea for a year and i'm like awesome i
knew some d students in high school who
needed to escape too
you know like we all know okay good some
of you knew some people who needed to
flee
um that's good it's just frustrating i
don't know it was never worse i worked
at the olive garden for two years um
hold for applause okay um wow some of
you think you're too
good to clap for the olive garden well
have i got something to tell you you're
not
um no i love the olive gar i worked
there for a while and i remember this
one time i approached
this table it was like three elderly
white guys and you know we
you know exchanged pleasantries and then
at one point one of the guys at the
table was like
say son are you korean and i was like oh
my god that's an amazing gas
and how did you know that and he was
like well i fought in the korean war so
i know a thing or two about this
and i was like what does this mean for
our relationship now
do you need a new server are you going
to have a flashback or something like
what's going on like it's almost worse
when people guess correctly like
i met this guy on a dating app and we
exchanged numbers and we were texting
back and forth
and out of the blue at one point he was
like so you're korean right and i was
like
yeah it's amazing like how did you guess
that and he was like your eye shape
and i was like oh like are you gonna
measure my skull next like what
where are we going with this and the
weirdest thing is is that i hadn't sent
him any pictures of my face i'd only
sent him pictures of my butthole so i
don't know what eye shape
he was talking about
very confusing very confusing
deal with a lot of questions about my
race but one question i get a lot
um and it's sort of like a jokey
question um i
you you probably get it too do you get
like a jokey question that
bugs you okay so on the count of three
we're going to say the question
that we get at the same time and
hopefully
it's the same question because this is
on tv
okay this is a big life
moment for me so if you mess this up
just think about have that weight on
your shoulders um as i count down from
three okay
one two three do you eat dog
okay you didn't say anything um that's
outrageous um
no that's the question people think
they're so clever like they're the first
person to ever like
ask me this question do you eat dog and
he used to piss me off and like upset me
because i get it like i know why you're
asking the question
but at this point in my life i'm like
yeah i would [ __ ] eat a dog
why not i eat all the other meats uh
it doesn't seem like an issue okay i'm
losing you um
i can sense that but but but bear with
me there's a point
do i have any dog owners in the audience
tonight make some noise if you're a dog
owner
okay you guys have dogs here's the thing
i would eat your dog side unseen i would
um
you don't even have to show me a picture
i just know that i would eat it
uh if it were presented to me if it were
cooked nicely you know um
but the thing is is that's the line for
me like there's all these ads in new
york right now that peta has that has
like a spectrum of animals and it's got
like a pig on one side and a dog on the
other and it's like
why would you eat this pig but you won't
eat that dog and it's like because i've
never met that pig
okay if i knew its first name that might
change
things that's the message of charlotte's
web it really is you can eat any old
pick you want as long as it doesn't have
an inner life
you know and that's where things get
really dicey like what they need to do
is do what they do with cigarette packs
uh in europe you know they put like
blackened lungs on the outside of the
packs
if they would just put facts about the
cows on the burger patties
i'd never eat another goddamn burger you
know it was just like
this is daisy her favorite color is blue
and i'd be like i can't eat daisy she
likes magnolia i love that movie
we have too much in common i can't do it
