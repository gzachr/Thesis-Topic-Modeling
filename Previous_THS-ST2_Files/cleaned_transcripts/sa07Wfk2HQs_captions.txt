Imabelle and I flew from Manila, Philippines to Cebu
To meet Wayne and Beth
ChristianFilipina.com members
that are taking a tour.
With Imabelle as the tour manager
and me working as the photographer.
My friends, this is the rest of the story.
Make sure to salute the flag, guys.
Today we're going to get wet
because we're heading out for another adventure.
These creatures are whale sharks
and boy are they huge.
Swimming with these guys is quite exhilarating.
Time for some refreshments.
This will be Wayne's first time trying coconut water.
Go ahead. Give it a try.
Let us know what you think.
Wow!
That is good.
You want some fish?
Here, we have a super old church.
And this place
was being built for barracks
for Spanish soldiers.
But then the Americans showed up
and beat Spain in the war.
So that ended finishing this place.
And now it's time to visit the famous Taoist Temple in Cebu.
This temple was built by Cebu's substantial Chinese community in 1972.
And more importantly
it's a great place for the perfect selfie.
So this is where it all went down.
Where the Spanish landed...Magellan.
And he came, and he did battle with Lapu-Lapu.
Here, they have the shrine to Lapu-Lapu.
In Cebu, they have the shrine to Magellan.
It's kind of like they couldn't decide
who the hero was so they built shrines to both of them.
But I think that's a very cool thing to do actually.
They can both have shrines!
Managing luxury tours
involves a lot of work
and seeing my guest having a great time is so fulfilling.
The first 2 days of the tour were filled with fun sight-seeing
and of course, the exciting day trip
to swim with the whale sharks.
Today we will be checking out of the first hotel
and we'll be moving to another beautiful resort.
I have great news!
The front desk officer just told me
that our room has been upgraded
from deluxe room to Mactan suite.
So we're going to have a suite for our stay here at JPark.
Woah!
This is quite the suite!
Look at this place!
We got a bar here.
Oh, my goodness!
This place is huge.
We got a whole living room area here.
And here's the bedroom. Check this out.
Look at this place.
This place is
designed for a movie star or a king.
Let's check out the bathroom. Come on.
Look at this.
Now here
I can surely bathe...in style.
Look at this bathtub.
And I can look at myself the whole time in the mirror.
Very cool.
This place is awesome.
And let's see what's here.
Wow!
A very beautiful
view from the balcony.
I slept like a baby.
Alright, let's go have some breakfast.
They have a great breakfast here, buffet-style.
Breakfast is not complete without bacon.
Let's go.
This is really amazing
I wasn't even
expecting to be able to do this.
Salamat.
Well guys, how was the experience?
It was fun...great.
Are you glad we talked you into doing that?
Yes! haha
This is something that I don't really do
all the time whenever I manage executive tours.
But this is my favorite.
Look at this!
There is a special dinner.
It's simple, but special.
Elizabeth,
my precious, Earth-angel,
will you accept this ring
and my proposal?
Yes.
This is Wayne
and I'm so happy
to have managed his tour.
And I would like to ask Wayne
how his tour has been so far.
I really did my best
and I'm so delighted to just do everything
to make sure Wayne's tour is really fun
safe, and remarkable.
So I'd like to make sure to know some things about that.
So far how would you describe you're tour.
It's been a wonderful experience.
Everything is so new from where I live.
It's just been a joy.
I've loved every minute of it.
I'm glad to hear that.
When I came from the airport
I met my finace.
I will never forget how it felt to
hold her hand.
I just want to say
it's been a pleasure to have a guy like you
that's such a happy guy
To see someone enjoying life like that.
It's been a real pleasure for both of us.
It's really inspiring actually just to see
a guy really come and enjoy his life to the fullest
Well, it's been wonderful.
