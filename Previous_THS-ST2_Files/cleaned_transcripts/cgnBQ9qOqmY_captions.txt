I 
am now a total germaphobe,
Always disinfecting, cuz on the news it’s
All about this virus ‘round the globe,
Kinda like World War Z, paranoia’s making
me
Freak out!
I freak out!
I freak out!
I freak out!
Covid-19!
I wipe down!
Wipe down!
Wipe down!
Wipe down!
Vitamin C!
Facemask!
Facemask!
Facemask!
Facemask
each time I go out!
I’m listening around for a cough!
I’m constantly, disinfecting everything..
I’m staying locked up in my house!
Don’t come near me, if you need me, whatsapp/viber!
Don’t want no stupid cough, cough!
Don’t want no stupid cough!
Ooohhh...
Now it’s time to stop this from spreading
Cough or sneeze in your sleeve
Stay at home if you can,
Don’t give this virus chance to breed,
Gotta cancel that cruise, better drink your
fluids, too,
Avoid crowds, avoid crowds, avoid crowds,
Good hygiene!
Don’t touch, don’t touch, don’t touch,
don’t touch your face
If you’ve got, a cough, fever, breathing
hard
Call your doctor now....
Don’t go panic shopping for stuff…
Wear a mask if, you’re feeling sick, please
don’t spread it.
Don’t be racist to us Asians!
Don’t be silly, the enemy’s, not human
beings,
It’s Coronavirus!
(I’m Filipino!)
Don’t want no stupid cough, cough!
Don’t want no stupid cough, cough!
Ohhh...
Don’t make it a reason to panic, while they
work on vaccines,
Know your information, together we’ll stop
Covid-19! *cough*!
Cover!
Cover!
This ain’t no CoVid cough, cough!
Just listen to your Gov, Gov!
And share this vid to all, all
So this song goes viral, oh!
No pun intended!
