hey everyone it's michael and i'm back again 
and in this video we're gonna be talking about  
a lot of the scams that can happen to foreigners 
over here in the philippines and these are the  
things that you need to watch out for now just 
let you guys know we had another video that we  
made where we talked about the scams that 
filipinas do to foreigners and expats but  
in this video it's more of like a things that 
can happen all throughout okay that filipinos  
will do to you other foreigners may even do to 
you as well as well as filipinas okay so let's  
talk about the top scams that happen to foreigners 
and expats here in the philippines the first one  
is of course the pickpocket scam where you know 
the thing though is listen guys there's a lot of  
people here that gets pickpocketed there's some 
really good pickpocketers here let me share with  
you guys a few scenarios that can happen normally 
happens if you go into a busy area like let's say  
you get into the lrt to mrt that's like the uh 
the train station train type transportation here  
in the philippines it's really close quarters so 
people are going to be bumping into you so that's  
going to happen it happens a lot also you know 
these these child beggars that like walks around  
and they surround you they're asking for money all 
i can say is one thing is don't even give money to  
not even just one of them i know you guys want to 
say well you know what i feel so bad for them i  
just want to be able to help you at least one kid 
out what ends up happening is you give one kid one  
and it's not like that's it's done and over all 
of a sudden you get surrounded by a bunch of kids  
and then now they're asking for you you're 
being distracted and turns out to be somebody's  
pickpocketing you in the back already some of 
these kids have these blades they cut below your  
pocket and pull your your wallet out of you so 
i truly suggest with you guys with your wallets  
you know keep it in the front or at the same time 
as you know don't have those really thick wallets  
you know around here you know because i know 
like in the states for example my wallet was  
always thick i had credit cards in there a lot 
of different things what you definitely want to  
do is just have a thin wallet at the same time as 
keep your your money separated you may have some  
of your money in your wall in your wallet but also 
have some in your pockets i actually walk around  
and have extra money and tucked under my shoes um 
just for emergencies i haven't been pickpocketed  
here yet so you know knock on wood and everything 
another thing that you guys can do to avoid being  
pickpocketed is you know you have your wallet 
wrap um a real thick rubber band around it and  
so when you put in your front pocket if somebody 
is trying to take it or if you actually put in  
the back pocket because you're so used to it it 
creates kind of some friction in there as well so  
um so at least you can notice what's going on 
right so the pickpocket scams happen you know  
and it's not just pickpockets as well you know if 
you're if you have a backpack around you you know  
best believe that you know somebody's gonna try 
to reach in and grab something in there and try to  
steal something so you know like for example my i 
have a backpack i walk around with a backpack here  
a lot of times but my backpack is one of those 
anti-theft backpacks where the only way you can  
open the backpack is if you actually take it out 
of your your bag and the zipper is in the back  
area so nobody can open the um backpack from the 
back at all okay not unless i take off my backpack  
um another thing also prevent that just go ahead 
and get yourself one of those one strap backpacks  
where you actually put your whole pack in front 
of you um that's something i truly suggest  
stay away from you know having a shoulder bag 
like a man immerse man purse because that's easily  
pulled and then yanked out of you right so you 
know i do have one of those for my laptop but i  
start i stopped using it um i just use my backpack 
if i have to go somewhere with my laptop here  
but at the very same time as when i did used 
to have that when i walked around i actually  
would put my hand in the strap as well 
so if anything happens if they pulled it  
it gets stuck right away and i can grab it okay 
so you know just watch out for a lot of people a  
lot of pickpocketers here it happens a lot um then 
there's just can you help me scam or what happens  
is you're walking and then somebody says you sir 
sir can you help me you know i i broke down or  
my white wife she's she's hurt you know can you 
please help and the last thing is here you are  
following them and you end up in a in a little 
what they call iskinita or a little corner and  
then you get robbed over there so you know what 
i know you have a kind heart if somebody asks  
for help be like stay right there i'll call for 
help i'll call the cops they'll come over here  
but don't follow them where they're going 
um you might definitely want to be able to  
avoid that the next one is you broke this scam uh 
typically happens sometimes let's say for example  
you go inside um this happened to my my um my 
little cousin you know so um he's not little  
no more but anyways he came over here to visit 
and so we're hanging out we ended up in a uh we  
went to the store and then for some reason um 
the security was telling him that he broke um  
like something like a lotion i think and then he 
was like no i didn't and of course here they are  
just a cute you know saying that he broke it he 
broke it and you know i came along and said all  
right that's perfect fine we'll take care of this 
but let me ask a question do you have video of it  
and they're like no okay did you see him 
break it and the guy's like no okay then  
so he didn't break it then if you didn't 
see it you can't accuse him that he did it  
and the next thing is i told him and it was 
it wasn't even like a mom-and-pop place it  
was actually a um it was uh if it was either a 
franchise or but it was a it was a nationwide um  
type of uh location and i asked them what's in 
your policy and procedure regarding somebody  
breaking something if they did break something 
what's in the policy procedure that it says he  
has to pay and the manager came out she said well 
yeah it's in our positive procedure and i said  
listen let me see the policy and procedure because 
if it is i'll pay for this myself right now  
without any without any complaints but if it's 
not in your policy and procedure we're not doing  
anything at all you can call corporate for me 
so you know they end up just like telling us  
to leave and i said that's perfectly fine you 
know because i'm not i'm not about that right  
um the you broke this can also happen let's 
say for example you do some rentals um that  
typically happens let's say for example you want 
to uh rent you're in a um in a touristy area  
and then all of a sudden you wanted to rent like 
one of those little scooters or those little you  
know they call it her motorcycles but i don't call 
them motorcycles they're like 80 cc's how could  
that even be a motorcycle to me right and unless 
your motorcycle is above uh i don't know a 600cc  
then i'll we'll call it a motorcycle anything 
below that i call it a motorbike um but anyways  
you know what happens is they after you're 
done and return it they're gonna say hey  
you you damaged this you know and then you're 
like all of a sudden what you have to pay for  
that right they're gonna ask for a restitution for 
that also happens you know a lot if you go to the  
beach areas and you um you know you you borrow a 
jet ski and then all of a sudden you return they  
try to scam you for that say you broke the jet ski 
i don't know how you can scuff a jet ski really in  
the sea you know unless you bumped in somebody 
else but if you're not how could you damage it  
so all i can say is that if you're going to rent 
a motorbike here or a scooter here or any of that  
kind of stuff before you get on board go around 
it and tell the telephone like hey do you mind  
if i take a picture and a video around it just 
in case you know for emergency reason or just  
in case something happens and if you let them know 
that more than likely they won't even try to scam  
you're like oh this dude is smart so just make 
sure you do that as well the next one is the is  
the horse and buggy scam what ends up happening 
is you know you go in one of those touristy  
places and you want to get into a horse and 
buggy and they're going to take you around  
and stuff like that what happens is when you 
get in you know you already have the set price  
then all of a sudden they try to charge you more 
also another one is some of these horse and buggy  
guys you get into these things and they take you 
down the street and then here you are you know  
just enjoying the view and turns out to be there's 
these kids just runs up on you and just grabs your  
bag and runs away and how are you going to just 
jump out of the horse and bug you but by the time  
that you jump out of it they're already across 
the street and far away okay so you know i always  
just tell people you know what just enjoy the 
view walk around but don't even get into one of  
these horse and buggies there's no need for that 
if you really need to get some place really fast  
because you're tired and just grab yourself a 
taxi or a grab car that'll be the best choice ever  
right um the next thing is the the bar girl scam 
so you know a lot of you guys going to come here  
for fun and for enjoyment for a bachelor uh you 
know weekend or bachelor couple weeks right um you  
just need to be careful with a lot of the bar girl 
scams um a lot of times that goes on with that is  
you go to one of these go-go bars and what 
happens when you order a drink you have this  
little cup in front of you and that's where they 
put your receipt every time you order something  
and what ends up happening if you don't really pay 
attention they doubled down on your receipt they  
added an extra receipt in there so always make 
sure um before they put the receipt in there you  
take a look at it first and sometimes the best way 
is you tell the waitress and like every time you  
put a receipt here i want to see it first and okay 
it okay so that's what you're gonna do as well um  
a lot of people say this is kind of a scammy 
thing but you know it happens a lot in those  
uh girly bars where you know a lot of the girls 
they make money because of um what they call um  
ladies drinks and so sometimes you you have 
a girl with you and then all of a sudden um  
she's like oh buy my friend a drink buy my friend 
a drink buy my friend a drink and you don't want  
to be the cheapo person right or to look bad 
but you know you sometimes you have to say no  
right but sometimes what's funny is these bars you 
order these ladies drink and you think that you  
ordered them tequila but really it's just watered 
down it's just water or water down tequila so i  
don't even bother you know i would not even bother 
doing that right um so just make make sure you  
pay close attention as much as possible regarding 
that um the other one that became famous about  
a few years ago was called the lag lag bala 
scam which is pretty much um bullet drop scam  
what happens is if you're going through 
the airport and they start doing a search  
you know while they're searching you they drop a 
bullet in there and just one bullet can cause a  
lot of harm for you and so what's funny is um 
then they then they question you they brought  
they bring you to the side then you have to pay 
some money you know and it got really bad that you  
know the the current president started threatening 
say if this happens again you know if anybody does  
this again in the airports you know he threatened 
their lives and everything um and so um does it  
still happen um it hasn't popped up in the news 
in a long time um but that you know an old scam  
can always come back with something else right so 
just you definitely want to be careful with that  
the next one here is you understand the 
philippines is the land of um fake stuff  
it's the land of just everything that you can 
buy here is fake right they have a place for  
example in called kartimar where literally 
it's all about fake shoes like you can buy  
some fake jordans for like 20 20 us dollars 
right and so you know there's they even have  
grades you can ask okay is it great a b or c 
right it means that you know top quality um  
fakes right you know it's a top is it an a quality 
fake a b quality fake or a c quality fake right so  
you know that can be problematic as well and 
this there's also a lot of big medicine here  
it's funny when you're walking around sometimes 
especially more where a lot of the foreigners are  
going around when there's a lot of bars a 
lot of those kind of things there's these  
guys walking around and like saying hey do you 
want some bag or cialis you know somebody's  
selling cialis and viagra in the streets and 
you actually think that that's the real stuff  
come on right and that's just my thing so just be 
careful there's so many different you know fake  
products here that you might actually purchase um 
what's another uh scam that happens here that's  
being done oh you know [ __ ] scam you know you 
think it's a woman but it really is a man right  
uh just you know right now i just started laughing 
because what popped in my head was that scene in  
um hangover part two when they were in bangkok you 
know and he accidentally when stu figured out that  
he ended up sleeping with a a [ __ ] right and 
so um oh my god just laughing right now but yeah  
listen that can potentially happen so make sure 
you pay pay close attention to that kind of stuff  
i mean those are some of the typical scams that's 
going to happen here another thing that happens a  
lot is that is like the transportation scam that 
happens here um like a taxi scam for example  
especially when you first arrive in the airport 
and you know and you're a foreigner and you're  
by yourself well guess what someone's going to 
try to take advantage of you over there though  
there's these guys outside like hey do you 
need a ride and you just need to get to the  
you know to your hotel that's close by and they're 
going to be charging like 20 now i understand like  
in the states for example you know when i used to 
live where i used to live going to the airport it  
was going to cost me around 60 to 70 worth of taxi 
fare right and so when you hear twenty dollars or  
even ten dollars she's like well that makes sense 
let me pay for that but really it's not worth that  
you know so the best way to get around that is 
you know just go ahead and download the grab app  
um which is the uber version over here and all 
you need to do is you know before you even arrive  
to the philippines just download the grab app 
so when you get in here you can start using it  
and you can order yourself a grab you know 
there's two ways to order grab in the airport  
just go ahead and use the app and use it and they 
will come and pick you up or they have actually  
stalls where somebody can order a grab for you 
and then um you just have to line up but to be  
honest to make it faster just order it yourself 
and just meet them wherever you need to meet them  
that'll be the best choice so those are just some 
of the basic stamp oh additional stuff in the taxi  
scams wise where you know if you get to a taxi you 
know make sure you tell them can you please turn  
on the meter if the guy says you know the meter's 
broken then you say that's okay let me get off  
right or sometimes they're going to try to 
haggle just pay me this much and we'll be okay  
don't do that use the meter if the 
guy doesn't want to use the meter  
get out the cap that's my true suggestion for you 
guys all right so i hope you know be sharing with  
you guys some of the potential scams that can 
actually happen to you here in the philippines
