um they're really possessive based on my

and I don't think so but they're really
really mature yes I'm not sure how
mature would you say like what was the
age Gap oh my God but we have a 20 years

like uh younger than me and then
and then everything everything changed
yeah it's like 20 20 age Gap and it's
you know it's kind of new for me okay so
yeah maybe and then he's really mature
for me and it's really possessive and
it's really overprotected yes maybe
because he cares about it you know guys
