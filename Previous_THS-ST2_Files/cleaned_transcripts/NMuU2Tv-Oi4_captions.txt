This is my homemade fish pie
and this is our tea
I did preheat the oven to 160
I will put this in now
Good afternoon my love
I did not vlog earlier as there is nothing much going on
Earlier this morning, the rain is pouring down
Time is 4:07pm
I'm alone in the house
because John went out but he'll be back in 10 minutes
He went out to pick up some of part of jukebox
I forget what is called
Later on will try to convince John to apply a blackhead peel off mask
I hope he will agree
because sometime he be a kill joy
I think he is just shy because he is not use to it that I am vlogging
before then I like vlogging
When we know each other
but I do not have the confidence to talk the camera
Just taking footage or video
thats what we did
Now, that I am vlogging
He seems awkward about it  because I post it in youtube
My husband is over atcing. :)
but will try
hopefully he will agree
My beloved husband is here
He doesn't have the key so will open the door
*he did not take any notice*
10 minutes left
My vegetable is also ready
and my fish pie
I did put a tray the pie dish becase when it boil over
I do not need to clean the oven just the tray
because I don't like cleaning the oven
mostly John will clean the oven
My husband is still on the phone
He is talking to a customer
I did forget to show you this
I did my grocery top up haul I think yesterday but I forget to show you this little bag
we did bought this cute little bag
Look!my homemade fish pie
It did boiled over
Look
Scrumptious!
It did boiled over
its a good job that I put tray
We don't do plating when we eat. LOL!
I am so annoyed with my husband
I did assume that he will say yes
but he did say no
I'm getting excited in doing it
because he has a lot of blackhead
he said I can do it off cam
Anyway, we will go to tesco
to do some grocery shopping
I did plan to vlog this but my husband refused
I failed!
I'm still annoyed
I did not talked to him
my eye bag is big
There's no a lot of people here
thats why I vlog
I'm still annoyed to my husband
because he refused to do so
Its almost time for closing so there is not a lot of people
John: Can I help you?
John: What are you doing in my car?
John:Who are you?
Mia: I'm the boss
John: No, you think you are.
I will eat jelly, my favourite.
and I add ice cream
It so delicious, you should try it.
