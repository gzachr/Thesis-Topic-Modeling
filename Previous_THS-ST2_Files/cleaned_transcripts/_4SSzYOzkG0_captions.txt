Good afternoon from Manila.
It's really crazy out here.
Well, it was a couple minutes ago,
uh, but me and Roy, uh, waiting
for a jeepney those over this side.
All right he's leading the way, because I have no
idea, uh, where we're going, but we're
gonna catch a, a jeepney, which is one
of those really cool limo things that
was going on about a few days ago there,
like the local transport, you can chuck like
20 people in the back and it costs like
10 or so pesos to go wherever you want.
So literally like 20 cents,
um, to get around town.
So we're gonna head to.
Um, Divisoria, which is like a massive market,
uh, tons of fake goods, you know, all
the stuff that I love when I visit
a new country buying fake Ray-bans,
you know, fake t-shirts fake shoes.
So we are going to go there and,
uh, going a little bit of a market
hunt, but we got to get there first.
So I think they kind of just
like come along the road, right?
Yeah.
All right.
Well, we'll wait and see what happens.
I'll see.
There's like a green one up there.
Hopefully, we get like a really cool color and
we can hop on the back, hang out the
side and experience the local life here.
Or the local mode transport here in
the Philippines. Are Jeeps only in
Manila or they're like all in the, like
every city?
- Here in the Philippines?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
They're all over.
In the provinces the jeepneys are,
x2 the big.
They're bigger.
- Yeah.
I'm sure we'll be catching plenty more.
Uh, along the rest of this trip.
 Got to cross the road.
Dodging weave, dodging, weave.
Hello.
You can say hello to anybody here
and they'll, uh, they'll be there.
Yeah.
This is why you have a local
person here that knows the
language and knows the areas.
They can tell you exactly where you
need to go and how to get there.
Jollybee.
Oh, there look.
Oh, look at all.
So, oh, look at all that.
So where's that one going?
How do you know where they're going - 
They have signages there.
Ah, wow.
It's so cool.
We'll catch it there.
That one's going to Divisoria? All right we'll -
they're coming frequently, so we'll be
able to hop onto one pretty easily, but
there's so many, you can see the red one.
One they're just like limos.
They're so cool.
I'm so excited to hop onto one.
So they all come, uh, this way
and then yeah, that way and
then Divisoria's that way.
Okay so any anyone that's
coming here, we can hop on.
Perfect.
So there should be coming.
Oh, they even have like tuk tuks.
How cool is that?
There should be a few coming
through and we can just hop
on to them whenever they come.
And it will take us to where
we need to go, which is Divisoria.
This one?
Oh no, that's going near Ali's hotel.
This one?
Oh yeah look Divisoria.
You want to ride in the front?
Yeah, let's get in the front.
Oh, does it stop for me?
I don't know.
Alright, ready to go.
We're in the driver's seat now.
Hey brother.
All right we're in the back of a jeepney.
How good.
So you can see, we got the driver here.
All kinds of things at the front.
And I think,
so that one there, it says Divisoria on the
other side and everybody's in the back.
Hello, everybody going
good? Friendly bunch of -
bunch of people in the back.
But here we go.
We're on the side of a jeepney.
These are so cool.
Literally like how cool does this look?
How could you not love catching
the local transport here?
If it's this.
So, so, uh, artistic, so awesome.
You gotta watch out though.
If you stick your head out, you
might get clocked by a pole or
a motorbike that's coming by.
So I've gotta keep my eyes out,
making sure that there's nothing
dangerous coming up ahead.
Hey brother.
Good?
So how much does like
the ride cost per person?
10 pesos, each?
Wow.
So it's like 20 cents just to
get us where we need to go.
And how far is the ride?
Like 10 minutes?
5 minutes?
- Around 10.
Yeah it depends on the traffic.
That's so good.
So, so affordable and cheap to get through
to the places that you need to be in.
Oh, so he switched that, cuz
they're gonna go back, go back.
Ah, so is this where we need to go?
Yeah.
Quick ride.
Could you ask him how, uh, how
many years he's been driving for.
20?
Everybody's been here for
20 years doing their jobs.
We should get off here.
Okay.
Oh, wait.
Let's pay him.
There you go.
You can keep the change.
It's fine.
All good.
Can I get out?
Thank you so much.
Salamat.
That's our Jeepney ride done everybody.
Let me get a quick little walk
around of this, the blue hummer.
How cool is that?
Got some fresh wheels on there and, uh,
Hey, that was a pretty good experience.
I'm glad Roy was here, cuz I would've
had no idea when to get off or
what to pay or what it is, but.
Where we need to be.
Look at these birds.
They've even got colored
chickens at the bottom.
Hey brother, how are you?
Good.
I need to start getting used
to saying those words, but wow.
Yeah everybody's selling stuff here.
We got bags.
Oh yeah.
Oh, this is exactly what I want.
We finally found the
entrance into like the market.
And I'd walked around this area a
little bit yesterday when I filmed my
first video here and it was good fun,
but now we're in the middle of it all.
So many things like dresses.
More dresses suits.
It's so muggy in here, not much airflow
and whatnot, but there's so many alleys.
You can go down, man.
Busy.
What's he carrying? What's he got?
He's blocking the whole alley.
All right.
Look, I think, I think
I'm gonna try to find.
Um, maybe another basketball shirt.
The Jersey that I bought yesterday is
really good, actually pretty good quality
for 500 pesos, which is around like $10.
And it's actually like really comfortable.
I'm not wearing it today.
Because I was wearing it yesterday and
got pretty dirty needs to wash, but
well there's so many like cool little
things, dresses again, underwear.
I am.
I'm lost.
It's like a maze here.
Yeah.
Literally a good maze though.
Yeah.
You're not trying to find the exit.
You're just trying to find the
next thing you purchase.
Gonna get through the obstacles.
Thank you, brother.
Okay.
All right.
Roy asked somebody about the,
uh, the basketball jerseys.
And now we're on a wild goose chase
trying to get through everybody
trying to find the specific store.
Hello.
Shout out sir.
What is he saying?
Shout out.
Shut up?
Shout.
Oh, shout, shout out.
Oh, what's your channel?
This is the way, man.
It literally is a maze.
I don't know how to get back.
Yeah, we're gonna come out.
Not where we started.
But as long as we end up with
the basketball uniforms or a
new basketball shirt, I'm happy.
Wow.
Oh, we're back.
We're back where we began.
Yeah, we are.
We are back brother.
You know where I can
buy basketball Jersey.
Mall 168.
Thank you brother.
I'm missing out on too many opportunities.
I had the camera down for like 30 seconds
and so many interesting things happened.
People yelling at me saying, hi baby.
Is hi baby,
like an inside joke in the Philippines?
Because I hear it a lot.
Yeah.
It's like, I think they find you handsome.
Oh, keep calling me baby.
Oh, we got fresh corn.
Hey brother.
How much is one?
How do you, how do you
ask how much in tagalog?
Magkano?
20.
20 pesos or $20?
No.
Which one?
20 pesos.
Um, I'll have one of your finest corns,
please, which one's the best one?
White corn.
It's like, it's like these ones.
Oh, okay.
It's a sweet corn.
Sweet corns.
Yeah.
I'll I'll have a one, please.
Would you, would you like one?
No.
So he peels it off?
He chucks it in the bag.
And that's it.
Is it warm?
Oh, it's really warm.
Very good.
What's your name
Brother?
Very good.
How, how many years have
you been the corn man?
Many, many years.
Many, many years.
Many, many years.
Very good.
You're from Manila?
Yes.
Ah, very good.
All right, let's try this corn.
Everybody.
I've had corns in many parts of the world.
This guy hasn't stolen from my wallet.
Like it happened in Cairo, in Egypt.
Um, that corn man, not a good
corn man, but this guy, because
he didn't steal from my wallet.
He's a good corn man.
But here we are.
Oh, it smells super fresh for this one.
This one's steamed.
So I guess down there, is it hot water or?
Yeah, it's hot water.
It's been boiling all in there,
so, oh, actually you can see in
there that you can see the water.
So that's super hot in there.
Um, It's just like it's
steamed instead of like, it's how I've
had before cooked on the charcoals.
So let's just get a big bite of this.
It might like squirt everywhere.
I feel like these are
gonna go everywhere, but it -
Is it sweet?
It's sweet, but not as sweet as I
was expecting, but it's kind of -
I feel like the, the inside's not sweet.
The outside, like when you
go for that first bite, it's
actually like really sweet, but
some, do you have like sauces
that you can put on it?
Or it's literally just corn?
- Usually
there's salt and butter, but he
doesn't have.
- Oh, he doesn't have it.
Yeah.
Do you wanna ask the other guy?
Yeah, we asked other guy.
Yeah we asked the other guy I'll give him,
uh, do you reckon he would have it?
I, I think so.
I'll give him
50 pesos.
Oh, actually I have a better idea.
Let's try the yellow
corn and the white corn,
25 for this one.
So I can try this one?
I can grab it?
My brother, I need to pay you.
I need to pay.
Does he not want?
No, he'll wait for you there.
And then we'll try the yellow corn here.
You have that.
That's fine.
That's good.
No, that's fine.
You keep change?
Yeah good.
Great corn.
All right, let's get a few more bites of
this and then we'll try the yellow one.
Oh.
Let's go.
Now we got a mouthful.
Still got your teeth?
That's done, then,
we'll try the yellow one.
Can I just grab it?
Yeah.
Good.
All right here
we have. Big yellow corn.
Now the yellow corn is the one
that I'm used to back home.
We don't have the white corn, but
oh, in here it's like super hot.
It's like a steaming kind
of like volcano in there.
You can feel it the heat.
And that's just been roasting in the.
Boiling over the hours.
Let's see this one's any sweeter
or if it's any different,
it's dripping like crazy.
Oh
Yeah that one's way better.
So much more sweeter.
These are good.
I love corn.
Because, let me finish my mouth first.
I was saying I love corn because it's super
sweet and it's actually healthy.
It's not like you're eating chocolate.
It's actually like a healthy snack that
you can have on the side of the street.
And how much was, this is 25, right?
Yeah 25
- Is the white one -
Because it's bigger
or because it's the color?
So he buys this per piece,
and this one he buys for, uh, like per kilogram.
Yeah.
Okay.
Very good.
I like it.
Yellow.
Definitely.
The better one.
There you go.
Thank you you can keep change.
Good.
Because your corn is better.
I give you more tip than the other guy.
Ah, nice little snack
from the side of the road.
You heard that?
What did he say?
He got 100.
All right we got to cross the road again.
The, the colored ones?
Yeah.
Wow.
Do you think he'll care if
I video, he might get angry?
No, it's okay.
Hello?
Are they like what?
They're literally just dunked
into food coloring or paint or?
Ah he just buys it.
There's all these in Australia,
we call these buggies.
I remember when I was growing up, we
had a few like buggy pets, like birds.
Well, no, we got like pigeons.
I think birds.
These are the interesting ones.
Pink, yellow, blue, green, different.
So what they, they die
because of the color.
No.
He definitely is not very, yeah,
he's he doesn't want to talk.
fair enough.
Um, so what do people buy them for?
For pets.
And then they die after five days?
No, no, after 1 month, 45 days.
Oh, okay.
Interesting pet choice.
I must admit we're gonna
keep walking this way.
Apparently there's a, another
mall called like 168 and there
we can get basketball Jersey.
So I'm really keen on getting.
Basketball Jersey here in the Philippines.
So we'll get the national team, we'll get
the national, uh, the national basketball
Jersey, and then we'll blend in with the
locals because they love the basketball here.
All right we made it into the mall guys or
into like the fake market area.
This reminds me kind of, hello.
How are you?
Okay.
Um, this reminds me of the market.
That's like underground
in Delhi that I was at.
I can't remember the name of it,
but it was like AC it's like fully,
um, like underground, hidden area.
They weren't too happy when I
was filming there in Delhi, there
were a couple shopkeepers that
are weren't too fond of me.
But we've still got a nice video there,
but people seem to be a lot more open
to the camera here, which is good.
All right we're heading upstairs.
This literally reminds me
exactly like the Delhi one.
There was so many levels to that one,
but we're looking for the Gilas Jersey.
It's the national team
here in the Philippines.
I think maybe they have it.
3rd floor?
- Upstairs again?
Third floor.
When in doubt, keep going up.
I'm surprised how hard it is to find.
It shouldn't be this difficult.
Yeah.
Oh, when something's difficult,
you're know it's worth it.
I don't see any basketball
jerseys here, Roy.
I see Jollybee though.
The greatest fast
food chain in the world.
Did you try Jollibee?
Yeah, I had it yesterday.
Do you like it?
Yeah, especially spaghetti.
Yeah, the spaghetti's the best, but
maybe I'll go yes to spaghetti actually.
No, we, no.
We'll buy the Jersey first and then we
can celebrate by getting Jollybee.
Love me some Jollybee.
Oh, look at all the -
Nike's here.
These are all fake, right?
Roy?
Yeah.
Yes.
So is it like, is this shopping, is this
legal like they're allowed to sell here?
Yeah they're allowed.
- Then they're allowed
to sell fake goods and stuff.
Oh, very nice.
Maybe we should buy a new
pair of shoes or something.
I need some runners.
Hello?
Hello.
How are you?
I'm fine.
What else do you have?
I am looking for a new pair of shoes.
These Nikes.
Do you have like big size,
like 45?
Um, alright, let me pick a color.
What do we like?
Here you have converse?
Yeah.
Yes, please.
45?
Yes.
Or do you have big 46, maybe 45.
You have?
Yeah, I try 45 please.
Oh she's going upstairs.
Climbing up the Fireman's ladder.
Geez.
It's where all the goods are.
How much would you pay for these Roy?
Roughly?
Like what's a good price.
Maybe around 500.
It's pretty good for like knockoff ones.
Oh dude.
These are so cool.
That is insane.
Kobe's.
Do you have big size of these?
Yes, sir.
Can I try as well?
45 please.
That is so cool.
Rocking the Filipino Nikes.
Oh man.
I hope they look good.
Right?
We can try on the converse and then
we'll try on the, uh, the Filipino Nikes.
Are they like custom made or
does Nike actually produced one?
That's such a smart idea.
Imagine if Nike came out with like every
single country in the world with their
national colors, but these are cool.
How much are these?
980 sir.
980.
Oh, she's coming down.
There we go.
Oh my shoes.
Have you ever seen one of these before?
No.
- Ever?
No.
So Kobe went to the
Philippines and made the brand.
Yeah, he's saying it's Manny
Paquiao's shoes.
signature shoes.
- Manny Paquiao he's like
in, he's like a politician now, right?
Yeah.
God, how times have changed
boxer turned politician.
Do people like him, like as a politician?
Actually, I'm not even gonna ask you that.
That's so controversial.
I don't want to have people
in the comment saying
Well, I will say yes, he is good.
He's a good man.
Yeah, he's a good man.
Oh, very good.
What size?
45.
- Amazing.
You went for so long.
You have to go.
You have to go and buy them from China or?
For context, we were here
for about 10 minutes.
Oh, these are perfect.
You know, I wasn't actually
expecting these to, um, to fit
nicely, but these actually fit nice.
These actually cool.
Now I can go onto the streets and
just get everyone beaten in basketball.
No, you're Manny Paquiao now.
So these are Manny Paquiao shoes
or just -
- Yeah, the guy said.
That's Manny Paquiao's
signature shoes.
How sick do they look?
They look so cool.
Yeah, especially this side.
They're clearly fake, but when
you're, uh, when you're speaking
of like around 900 pesos.
Yeah, like $18 or so that's
like the perfect little, uh, little
gift they actually fit really nicely.
This is actually, I'm stoked that
you saw these, but I'm only gonna be
buying 'em if I can get a good price.
You think I look pretty?
Yes, sir.
Yeah, they look awesome.
So you said, uh, 200?
No.
How much?
980.
Maybe I, I give you 950.
- 950 only
30 pesos discount, you can do a
little bit more, maybe like 500?
No  no.
Who is the boss?
He is the boss?
You are the boss?
No, I'm a saleslady. And he's a salesboy.
They are very nice.
I must admit, can we do
like 700 pesos?
No, sir.
Little less than.
- Less prices
900.
So you can do 800 then, right?
No,  not 800.
What about 850?
No.
What about
890? We'll settle for 900.
That's okay.
I am happy with them.
They're like really cool.
Got the Filipino colors.
Like that's the flag, right?
Yeah.
 
There's the golden stars on there as well.
That's so awesome.
Thank you.
Thank you so much.
Now all I need is a, uh, Gilas.
Yeah, um, Jersey and then we're
full Filipino basketball player.
Oh, it's okay.
I can just in the bag.
Perfect.
Thank you so much.
You can keep the change.
We do 1000.
You keep thank you so much.
Have a great day.
I am ready to hit some three pointers.
Boom, boom, boom.
All right where did Roy go?
He's gone.
Well, unfortunately we didn't get the,
uh, Jersey that we were looking for.
So I did make a rule.
I would be able to treat myself to
Jollibee after we got the Jersey.
So unfortunately, Jollibee is
gonna have to wait, which stabs
me in a heart in saying that,
but until we have that Jersey, we
can't celebrate with Jollibee.
So.
Gonna still hunt for that Jersey, but
we're gonna head back down on the street,
see if we can have any luck there.
Uh, and then hopefully we can have
Jollibee afterwards as a celebration.
Here's a couple of, uh, jerseys.
Maybe they have the national team.
Can you see it anywhere, Roy?
Wow.
Come here.
Hello again?
Hello.
I'm here for I'm here for one specific -
Oh, this one, this one
will be perfect for me.

We're looking for, uh, the, uh, Filipino Gilas.
Gilas Jersey.
No, not hello, kitty Jersey.
You have?
No, like for me, for me, for
me, big size, big size.
So there are bulls.
Let me know if you see Gilas anywhere.
I don't think they have, they don't have
the Gilas, but I mean, these Lakers

Good?
Yeah, I can try?

All right, everybody close your eyes.
Everybody close your eyes, stripping off.
I said, close your eyes, everybody.
Thank you know, luckily guys,
since I filmed the last series
I had like a two month break.
I was getting pretty fat, uh, in the
Sri Lanka series and the India series.
Because I had too many.
Too many cheese parathas, but since
then I've been at the gym a bit.
Oh, okay.
That looks beautiful.

Roy?
How much does Roy have to pay?
I'm not paying.
Roy's paying.
Hey, I'll pay 300.
You pay 300.
No.
That's foreigner price?
It actually is like
pretty good quality to be fair.
And it's so humid here in the Philippines.
They're like having these little holes in
the aeration, it's much better than these,
um, than these like cotton ones that don't
have any aeration or anything at all.
Because it's starting to get
a little bit humid here.
There's still blue skies.
But the overcast rain's coming and it's
starting to, uh, heat things up, but
you can do discount little bit cheaper.
You got some music in
the background as well.
I want a good deal.
Good deal.
300.
No, yesterday, yesterday I bought
two.
The owner would get angry
she said.
-  You are the owner though, right?
You're owner?
No, she's, she's just, uh,
She's employee, 400? 450?
Roy
I need your Filipino
expertise in bargaining here.
How do I.
You know, you can, you can
relate to the Filipino people.
How do you get a cheaper price?
I don't know.
Let, just walk out.
Okay goodbye with the Jersey on, good price.
Good price.
Another one, another one.
Yeah, no, I just want the one we
can do 450?
She's a tough bargainer.
Two pieces.

Yeah why would I buy that's the same price?
Dennis Rodman.
Two pieces, 500?

No, she's tough.
All right.

How much would it cost for like a local person?
I reckon 350?
Yeah.
Is this like good?
These is like, it feels like decent.
Pretty good quality.
So maybe that's why it's a
little bit more expensive.
Oh, look at all these
little desserts and stuff.
What are these?
Have you had these before?
Yeah.
What are they have?
Not sure for the English
word for it, but it's, kakanin.
Sweet or savory?
Yeah sweet.
Cassava cake.
You know Bibingka?
So like these are
different flavors, right?
Yeah.
How much is it for?
Can I try everything?
20.
Can I try like a little bit
for like 50 or everything for 50?
All right let's try these local sweets here.
Perfect.
Oh, it's like, what's it made of,
it looks like jello kind of.
Is that, is that cheese on?
Is that cheese on the top?
Yeah that's cheese.
Oh, all right.
Now I'm in heaven.
Oh, that one's purple.
Ah.
Blueberry.
- No, Ube.
I have no idea what these words
are that you guys are saying,
but I like the sound of them.
Hey bro.
Going good?
Oh, they smell, they kind of smell
coconutty I can smell the aroma.
I reckon this one's good.
Oh, these kind of remind me
of ones that I've had in Iraq.
When I was in Najaf, I believe
I had this really delicious,
sweet, uh, I can't remember -
was the name, uh, of it.
It was so good.
I ate like half a kilogram in a day.
No, not American.  Australia.
Rice cake.
Ah, oh my God.
That is so heavy.
All right, let's try
all of these right now.
Can I put here?
Okay.
All right.
Let's try this one.
So this one, I think
was the very first one.
Maybe we'll try a little bit of each.
So what's the name of this one?
It's so floppy.
Look at that.
So it's rice cake, right?
Sweet?
Very sweet.
It tastes coconutty.
If you've been to Australia,
you must have had Lemington
sometime in your life.
There.
It reminds me kind of the texture and
the taste of a Lamington, probably
because there's coconut in there and
on the top of a Lamington there's
coconut, but oh, that one's nice.
That's um, let's try this one.
This one, look at the colors on that.
Bright blue.
Yeah.
Look at that.
Blue, yellow.
There's like three layers in there.
And then you got, got like
the crispy bit up the top.
The name of this one?
Look at what it is.
This is such a funny texture.
Ah rice, rice noodles and rice.
Yeah.
Oh, right.
Oh.
I don't like that one.
That one has the weirdest texture ever.
The, um, sticky rice, the
bottom bit is that is so weird.
I don't even know how to describe that.
It's very, um.
- But it's sweet right?
It's sweet.
This one's a little more bland.
The other one was very sweet,
but this one doesn't have like
the coconut, um, kind of on top.
Look how, like, it's just like
the weirdest texture ever.
It's purple, what on earth
am I eating?
It's good to try out.
The local foods, uh,
regardless, let's try out.
We have, uh, oh, we got a lot.
We got two more.
There's this one, this one's
a lot more look at this.
This is like a purple block of chalk with
a black bit on the top, a lot less floppy.
Way better.
That is, that is number one so far.
That's called Ube.
Ube.
Oh my God.
I like that one.
Which one?
This is which one?
Which, ah, this one.
Ah, yeah, look are the colors on that.
Purple.
So such like a deep dark cup.
I really like the flavor or
that one again, given me kind
of like similar texture, similar
tastes to Aton back in Australia.
And then we got lucky last.
Rice cake.
Yeah.
And this is which one is this?
Ah, here, this one.
I have faith in this one.
I think this one's gonna be delicious.
You got kind of two layers,
sock bit there, a harder
crunchy, crispy bit on the top.
I'll try it out.
Wow.
That's completely different
to all of them more sweeter.
The top bit is really chewy.
And it's like, I think the top
bits been cooked a lot more.
It kind has the, um, the texture and
the taste to being kind of like more
cooked than the rest of the part.
So obviously it's like in the oven,
maybe in a pan, the top is a lot more
of the heat and that's how it gets the
crunchy bit on the bottom, on the top.
Sorry.
This one is what?
Yeah, I definitely like this one, the
most, the purple one, then this one and
the first one I tried, but this weird
thing, this, I can't even get it out.
doesn't want me, because I've said
so many bad things about it.
This one look at that least favorite, but
the other, other three are really good.
Delicious.
I'll save them for later.
Well, I'll save three of them.
The other one that I don't like
can go straight into the bin.
Very delicious.
Thank you so much.
That's okay.
You can keep the change.
Thank you.
All right, guys, we finish up
cheeky, little market hunt.
We got a few items.
We got the Lakers shirt.
We got the, the new, uh,
fresh Filipino shoes.
And uh, we tried a little bit of different
food and we're gonna make our way back
to the hotel, but we're gonna catch
another local, uh, form of transport here.
So I'm thinking what -
You said those tricycles, you
can hang on the back of yeah.
All right.
Like at the back of the driver.
Oh, that they have super cool.
There's so many things.
There's tuk tuks, there's big
tuk tuks, eight seaters there,
you got the, uh, Jeepneys.
You got electric little ones as well.
There, like big tricycles.
Uh, but Roy's on the lookout for
one passing by and we'll jump on
and head back, uh, to the hotel.
So let's get a ride and, uh,
tara na. We spotted something.
This green thing, it looks cool.
Roy's on the run.
He's on the hunt.
Hey brother, we hop in.
All right.
Are you getting in there?
I'll hop on the back.
Alright, sorry.
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
Goodbye little birdies.
All right ready to go.
This is so cool.
I'm you even get like a little
seat at the back here, so you can
just chill out, enjoy the ride off.
This is comfortable.
Oh, you can even hold onto these.
I just love how many different
forms of transport there are here.
People are riding tricycles.
You have different kinds of bikes
with attachments on the side.
Some of them have the extra seat
at the back for a passenger.
Some don't there's big limo.
Jeepney things.
There's little limo.
Jeepney things.
There's everything.
Look there's.
Golf cart.
There's motor device.
There's scooters, literally
everything you can imagine, you
can ride here in a Philippines.
So this is fun.
So he knows where we're going.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
And how much will it cost?
150, is that foreigner price?
We're only like five minutes away.
You can sit like this, face your body that way,
and your legs just hang out.
Oh yeah.
And hold there or here.
Oh, this is way better.
This is comfortable.
Oh yeah.
We're just going through the market.
We were walking down here before
you gotta watch your legs.
Whoa.
You might be hitting some
people from behind if you're
not careful with your knees.
That is.
So how many people can
you fit on here at a time?
Like -
Plus two there.
- Plus two here.
Oh my God.
This is good business.
Yeah.
Maximizing the amount of
patrons that you can service.
Oh boy, this is so much fun though.
He said eight people can be here.
Eight people like full grown adults, maybe
just maybe, yeah, maybe like a few babies
and little children in there as well.
But the best part is, you know, being on the side
of these, looking out here is you're
gonna admire all the different kind
of, uh, you know, fruit that they're
selling different kinds of vegetables.
You can, people watch all day.
You can say hello.
Apparently you can sit there.
And if you just pull it.
Yeah.
Can I go there now for bags?
For bags?
Oh, for bags, but you
can sit there as well.
I was like, Hey, I love
hanging out of moving vehicles.
So let me hop on the back.
Oh no, Jersey.
Is that it?
We wait, we can stop here?
Okay.
I'll leave my shoes.
We're just on the ride back home.
After searching for about 30 minutes
to find the Filipino Gilas
Jersey. He's gonna stay there?
Wait, here.
It was this one, right?
Is that it?
This is the -
Jersey of PBA, Philippine
basketball association.
It's not the national team.
Oh, but is the national teams over here?
Oh, I'm not sure.
Beause you're saying -
Bummer.
All right let's hop back in.
I thought we were lucky.
Thank you.
Ready to go.
I help on the back.
All right guys, we shall hold on.
Tight.
Grab on.
Hang on the back and, uh, enjoy the ride.
All right off we go.
Hey, this is super safe.
I'd never felt safer in my life.
Hello, kamusta ka?
Okay.
Very good.
People are pushing us.
all right, here we go.
Oh, this is incredible.
This is why I love traveling everybody.
You get to experience
things that you don't get to
experience in your home country.
And, uh, this is way better view
you get to admire all around.
You get to see the lake smells
are very, has a very strong aroma.
I'm not saying if it's pleasant or
not under saying it's very strong.
Oh, look, all this smoke up ahead.
They must be cooking up a
feast, but this is so much fun.
Hanging on the back.
We're not even going that fast, which
is good, because it's safer, but it's still
the exact same experience that you get.
It's more fun in the
Philippines, everybody.
And I can a hundred percent say that
statement is a hundred percent true.
I am having the time of my life here.
It is so good.
Look how beautiful Manila is
going through the back streets.
We're hanging on tight.
Oh look, there's big
bumps coming up ahead.
We gotta protect ourselves.
Whoa.
Up and over,
up and over.
Oh boy, this is fun.
I was just thinking one of the most brutal
things that could happen on the back here.
My feet are starting to
get a little bit tired.
I'm balancing on this, uh,
Ooh, little, uh, thing, but
imagine you lose your footing.
Foot goes down there.
Oh my God.
It almost actually happened.
Your foot goes down, hits the bottom.
And, uh, it gets caught
in between the metal.
That is a recipe for a, not a broken
ankle and obliterated ankle and
probably shin and knee bone as well.
So let's hope that not happen.
Let's hope that doesn't happen.
Uh, but I think we're coming
up to ongpin street, which
is where my hotel is.
So I think it's just over there,
but now we're on the main road.
This is where it's gonna get.
Interesting.
Hopefully there's no police around
that are gonna give us a ticket, Roy.
Yeah.
Would we get in trouble by the
police for doing this right then?
Yeah it's okay.
Oh, it's okay?
It's legal?
All right.
Good to know.
Oh, I love that.
I love this country that are fun.
Flexible with having fun and
allow you to do things like this.
Cause I can tell you right
now in Australia, geez, you'll
probably be going to jail.
If you were caught doing this, not that
this will be allowed on the road, cuz
you gotta be, have all these like checks
and stuff to make sure it's roadworthy.
But that's why I don't
live in Australia anymore.
I travel the world and uh,
enjoy it a hell of a lot.
It is fun.
I can sit on top.
How do I, how do I get up?
Wait.
Ah, up here.
All right.
All right.
We're on top.
Everybody.
We're ready to go.
Oh my God.
This is amazing.
It's not, uh, too friendly
on my butt, but it's fun.
Woohoo.
Yeah.
Wow it is definitely more
fun in the Philippines.
Everybody.
I'm having a great old time
with my Filipino shoes.
My Lakers Jersey.
Oh, this, honestly, this is
what I live for everybody.
This is why I love traveling.
I love the adrenaline of
doing crazy stuff like this.
And makes it 10 times better
when everyone around you is so happy.
So, um, so enjoyable.
So energetic.
It just, the vibes are
something else out here in this city in Manila.
Oh look, they got a
fair few people on this.
They got two there.
They got a couple in
the back or in the side.
Hello?
All gotta hold on.
Alrigh we're here.
Can you just hold that for a sec?
Brother thank you so much.
That was so much fun.
That was a, that was a great experience.
That was unbelievable.
I love every minute that,
so thank you so much.
You can keep the change.
Very good.

Thank you.
Have a great day.
See you, thank you brother.
That is great.

in Manila, going to the market
