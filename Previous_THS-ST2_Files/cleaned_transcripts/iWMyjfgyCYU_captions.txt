too hot for TV y'all too hot for TV
look at what I managed to do last night
broke my phone but I broke my phone
killing it on the dance floor so it was
worth it
okay so this little sausage with I don't
know what's on it bread or something
this costs five pesos it's just like a
meal
a small light meal and you could survive
on food like with no money here
everything's so cheap
dude I'm killing it out here
I feel like I'm becoming more and more Filipino
every day
okay so I haven't had a phone for almost a day
now and to be honest I kind of like it
I enjoy not having a phone
phones are bad for you kids they are
just a distraction
I can do just fine without a phone
so if I don't return your texts that's why
so whenever I come to a new country I
like to try all the foods all the special
foreign food so right now I'm gonna
check this spot out
have a feeling it's gonna be real good
hello world I am here in El Nido Palawan
in the Philippines
El Nido is the highest city in Palawan
and my last stop here I will definitely
say that El Nido is the most touristed
city I've been in so far a lot of
tourists which is no good and a bad
thing I prefer to go to places that have
a little less tourism but it's beautiful
and there's a lot to do and it's fun so
I like it. Right now I am a little hung over
so I'm gonna go rest and
while I do that.  you watch this sick video
also don't forget to smash all the
buttons
thank you
