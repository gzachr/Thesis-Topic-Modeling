We want to try the famous
Lechon meat
I read that this is something that we have to eat in Cebu
Two of them
are quite famous here
This is the house of Lechon
The other one is Rico Lechon
Now we are going to the Rico one
Later we will also go to a mall just nearby
to find just a
normal restaurant or food shop
To see if we can eat a lechon too
So we can just compare with the famous one.
Okay, it should be here because I just saw a sign Rico
But now we are just looking for the shop
Here
Is it this one?
Ahh right
Yes. We found it.
Oh look at that
We can see from the window how they prepare the lechon
And I think that this one here
They just, they just bring it
I think this is the whole
the whole animal here
Nice
Wow, the AC is strong
This is a big menu
And easy to understand actually
Yeah, there's a lot of pictures.
Yeah, and they don't sell a lot
Because the speciality here is lechon
So you can buy per kilo
and you have the regular lechon
So you have three per style
250 grams for 395 pesos
500 grams for 680 pesos
1 kilogram for 990 pesos. Hmm.
And I think the regular one, 250 is for 1 or 2 person. Okay.
So I think this is what we are going to take.
They
even have lechon feet
lechon head
spicy spicy lechon
So here what is it?
the whole one
Okay this is for party I think.
 Yeah. Oh you can even buy the sauce
I don't know what is the sauce. It's Sukalami
Maybe it's the chili
Spicy vinegar. Oh.
150 pesos
I don't know if it's expensive.
I don't know if you can find it in the supermarket
And there is something behind?
Sorry ah behind
Yeah, you have rice
you have seafood too
Ah, you have beef bulalo
for those
for those who don't want to eat pork
Thank you so much
So yeah, there are many choice actually.
But
as it's very famous for lechon
we are going to take lechon
Good for two? Okay, so one regular lechon
Is this coming with a rice or not? No. No rice.
Rice is seperate
okay, okay, so perfect
So, one plain rice
And one garlic rice
Ah, you don't have garlic rice? 
So many customers
Almost done on everything
No problem
Okay, it's fine. So, two plain rices.
Nice
Yeah. So, we order some lechon and vegetables with rice
Oh this is nice. I think this is all the pictures of the celebrities that came here
Oh, I know this guy
This is a famous Youtuber
I guess that this is the owner of the restaurant
because I can see him on almost every picture
Here
Here too
Ah here too
Do you know who came here?
A celebrity
A celebrity I know?
Yeah, it's not like a celebrity celebrity.
It's a c'est Youtubeur
YouTuber?
Filipino YouTuber?
No, no, somebody you know
American?
Yeah
Mikey?
Not Mikey
Mark Wiens
Not Mark Wiens
Ah Ranger..?
hmm so it must be really delicious here
This restaurant is really nice
We feel good here, has a good vibe, good decoration too
with a strong AC
and you can see
people cooking actually
preparing the food
I saw another star
In the picture
Ah, another star?
Youtuber star or..?
No this is a star
A real one
But  I don't know if you will think about him
because it's been a long time we
didn't talk about him
in France anyway
He's Asian, American or French?
I think he's Filipino actually
No I know he's Filipino
Willy Denzey?
No no he is Lao
Filipino?
Yeah, I don't know what is the song already
Hm? He's a singer?
Yeah he is a singer
Filipino
He was very famous, everybody knows him.
I don't know
I think he was going out with one French girl.
She was also a singer
Thank you. Thank you so much
Nice. The plate just came.
Okay so here we have the famous lechon here
Ooh, the skin looks really crispy.
And here we have the
Salad?
Eggplant? Eggplant salad.
I guess this is the rice
Yes steam rice
Oh, it's really hot
Ohh nice
And the French singer was also really known in France
Back then?
Yeah back then
Ahh, was he
was he with?
Lorie?
Yeah, Lorie, Lorie
Ah you know? You know then
Yeah yeah, I...
Billy something?
Yeahhh
Billy Crawford
Oh, there is even Billy Crawford here
Ah he came here?
Hey I think he lives here now
I think he lives here now. I don't know
This is a really nice pot. I really like it
It's nice.
Okay, we can try the lechon now
It looks super delicious
The skin
looks really crispy
The meat looks really like fatty
a big piece of meat.
There is actually a lot
we try the meat first
No skin. No skin
Only the meat
It looks super crispy
and the color is really beautiful too.
I am going to take this
Pretty good
It is
Yeah it's good too
I like it
It reminds me when we
the first day we came here in the Philippines in Manila
Our first meal
was a lechon too.
Oh yeah, in the tiny shop
The experience was totally different.
I think that it was a canned food and then she
just like fried the meat
But here, you have the actual meat.
I think I I prefer this one
You think or you're sure?
But actually it's different
For me it's different, I like both of them
but here yeah
it's the true meat
But I like the taste of the canned lechon too actually
But yeah, so it's really interesting to have
different kind of lechon
what is the meaning of lechon actually?
I don't know
If you guys can tell us in the comment section
I want to try the combo
of the meat and the rice together
Maybe it's better
I really like how they cooked the eggplant
I am quite surprised by the portion
of the lechon that we got
It is not that expensive
So yeah, pretty good deal
I just remember that they they gave us that
Let's try this one
Maybe we can put this one in the other one
So we can try both of them
A little bit spicy
Not too much but I like it
It's a little bit sour too.
Yeah I really like the sauce
Maybe it's the sauce that they sell
I think this is the soy sauce.
We'll see.
Soy sauce
It's better with this one 
I have to add more sauce
This is really good.
Ah yes with some vegetables
I feel that you are cold.
I can see that you are shaking
Yeah it's really cold.
Ah you can see it?
you are shaking
But it's okay
Yeah we're almost finished
You can see the wind here
You still have
one skin
I kept the best for the last.
We don't even know what it means
Instantly better
Now it's like blurry
Ah yeah
ah there is the smoke?
We paid a total of 695 pesos
and I think that it was
a good value meal
It's not that expensive and you can really eat very well
We are happy that we tried that.
Where should we go now?
Now we are going to a mall just near by
Ayala mall
I think this is one of the most famous one here in Cebu
I guess
We'll see
Wow, I have the impression that here is really
a lively part of Cebu
There's really many restaurants and a lot of people too
Many cars too
Have to look everywhere when we walk
because sometime you have sidewalk but sometime you don't
So you have to share the same road as the cars and the motorbikes
So it's a bit
a little more challenging
to walk
But it's the funny part.
Oh I think this is the other famous place to eat
for the lechon
House of Lechon. Taste Cebu.
Wow, this is pretty huge
and I feel good inside the mall
The AC is not too strong
Many shops that we know
like H&M
DIY
DIY reminds us of Malaysia actually
Wow, there's a lot of people here
What's going on?
We are really impressed by the mall
We know that there is another big one
SM city Cebu
We wonder which one is the biggest?
We could not find a lechon restaurant in the mall 
so we are going to look for it outside
Ah the area around Ayala Centre
is more modern
with high buildings
and there is a lot of condos too around
and we also noticed some offices
like company like
we saw Amazon sign, accenture, grab
maybe here it's more business district?
I'm not sure but
yeah we saw another
another side of Cebu and it's really interesting
and I also noticed that the
Jeepney
is kind of different
from the Manila ones
here it's looks more like a
like a van
Interesting to see
that can be different between
Manila and Cebu
It looks like there is a night market here
We can go and see
Unlimited!!? But we are not that hungry.. haha
We didn't stay very long at the night market
it looks really nice but it started raining
and just before going
I just took an avocado drink
look nice huh
cheers
So we found a nice restaurant here
It's called Ayam..
No. Not ayam
Ayer, ayer lechon
Ayer lechon
so we just wanted to try
one that is like
not famous
yeah not really famous for
I don't know if it's famous or..?
Maybe it is
Maybe it is yeah
But we choose this one just because it's near our hotel actually
But anyway it's just like a simple meal
It costs only 127
So we just wanted to
just to know what kind of taste we can have
in a normal lechon restaurant
they gave us a sauce also but I will just try
just like that.
It's quite good
It's a little bit too salted for me
I think it's vinegar with a bit of chili too
The same?
yeah it's kind of similar
But this is more sour.
Okay let's try the skin now
Mm. This one is quite good
it's very crispy
and it's not that salty
compared to the meat
So yeah it's quite good
If you have to choose only one restaurant, which one will you choose?
Rico
Rico lechon
Yeah I have to say that Rico is better
you can feel that
here the meat maybe it's a little more dry
and it's too salted for me
Rico is really tendery, juicy
and it's not too salted
And the sauce?
and the sauce also, Rico
Thank you for watching and see you in the next one :)
