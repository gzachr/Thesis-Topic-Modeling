in this video I'll be giving you 17 things you 
must do in Siargao this is your Ultimate Guide  
to the beautiful island in the Philippines the 
island is located in the south east of the country  
and is an absolute paradise and is known as the 
surfing capital of the Philippines you will most  
likely arrive at the Del Carmen Airport in 
Siargao Island and once you touch down there  
you'll get a shared minibus to your hotel this 
costs 300 pesos per person if you are located in  
general Luna if you don't know me I'm John I spent 
over two weeks exploring the beautiful Tropical  
Paradise of Siargao and I'm going to give you 
so much valuable information so before we start  
just please hit the Subscribe button it really 
does help me out so let's start with number one  
and that is come to Siargao wake park the Wake 
Park is located just a 15 minute ride from the  
general Luna town and honestly it is one of the 
funnest activities you can do on the island the  
Wake Park has literally been cut out of the palm 
trees and it looks so insane especially at Sunset  
even if you're a beginner or you're Advanced they 
take anyone and honestly if you've just started  
like me and Emilia had you can even stand up 
in your first session it was also insane just  
watching the pros do their things with their 
flips and all their tricks Emilia absolutely  
killed it out the wakeboarding I think I still 
need some practice though he did say I was a  
bit of a pro so I was quite proud of myself it is 
such a cool sport and we kind of want to do more  
of it now let's move on to number two and this is 
probably one of the biggest reasons people come  
to the island and that is surfing there are so 
many different surf spots all over Xiao gal right  
up into the North and also down south there are 
so many different surf lessons surf instructors  
surfboards to hire whatever you're looking 
for you can find it on this island if you're  
a beginner Surfer or an advanced Surfer there's 
different waves and different beaches you can go  
to which will fit your difficulty or whatever 
it is now number three is an epic sport where  
you could do big rock jumps and you can chill on 
the beach it's such a cool spot the name is like
I've tried pronouncing this thing a hundred 
times and I still can't do it so please forgive  
this spot is absolutely legendary and is so fun 
that you can only go here at low tide look up on  
the Internet and look when the low tide is you 
have to walk around the side of the beach and  
then you go to these Rock pools and you'll see 
locals and other tourists jumping off the Rocks  
into the water and it is pretty deep and the 
water is so blue and super clear the best way  
to get to this spot is by scooter and once you 
get there it's an entrance fee of 50 pesos per  
person I think there's also a parking fee of like 
10 or 20 pesos as well if you want to jump off the  
Rocks I would highly recommend bringing water 
shoes because the rock is super sharp once you  
finish jumping off the cliffs I highly recommend 
just chilling on the beach is a beautiful beach  
one of my favourite in Siargao also I don't know 
how to say Siargao sharagao shigal what is it I'm  
really struggling here I've said it too many times 
now the next spot is the palm tree Viewpoint again  
this is a super popular spot and you can kind of 
see how many palm trees are on shower girl there's  
basically a big flat layer in the middle and just 
gazillions of palm trees it's a cool spot to take  
an Instagram shot it doesn't take long maybe 
like 15 minutes there and you're pretty much  
done this isn't the only spot there are so many 
different cool tropical palm tree roads a long  
Siargao so stop off take some photos get those 
Instagram shots if you don't already follow me  
on Instagram because that's where you get the live 
updates for what we're doing and yeah why haven't  
you already moving on to number five and that is 
Cloud9 this spot is super cool and it's basically  
one of the best surf spots in the world so if you 
want to watch the pros then you can there's a big  
broad walk unfortunately last year in Typhoon 
Odette it actually got destroyed so they're  
currently rebuilding it but hopefully by the time 
you get there it's back to what it used to be the  
waves there are super super large so if you are 
a beginner maybe stick to the smaller waves but  
honestly it's such a cool place just a chill on 
the beach loads of people gather there at Sunset  
and it's just a great atmosphere apparently to 
get into the Cloud 9 area you have to to pay a  
hundred pesos per day per person but that money 
apparently is going towards building the broad  
walk also at Cloud Nine you can rent loads of 
surfboards there's loads of surf instructors  
if you are a beginner so the next place you have 
to go to in sagao is the cave pool and this is a  
much less touristy spot than other spots in shout 
out and I highly recommend it still because it's  
super fun it costs 100 pesos per person and 
that comes with a guide but also you should  
probably tip the guide on top so this activity 
goes through a cave and you can actually see  
Bats inside and then at the end you can do super 
cool jumps and go on a rope swing this spot is not  
far from some other spots which I'm going to be 
telling you later in the video the number seven  
is a super cool activity which I think is a must 
and probably one of the top five things you have  
to do on the island and that is sugba Lagoon this 
place is like no other it's like Roger ampat in  
Indonesia it is absolutely beautiful the water is 
so clear it's just like a cool jungle fill almost  
like mountains in the sea it's awesome there's 
also a super cool jump spot where you can go up  
the dive board we went on a private boat and I 
think it costs like two thousand three thousand  
pesos for the private tour I will check that and 
put it down below you can drive there by yourself  
or go on a Land Tour which does loads of different 
spots and that will be a cheaper option for you if  
you're on a budget we rented a paddle board and 
paddled around the islands through the water and  
it even rained and it was super tropical and just 
epic epic Vibes one of my favorite spots on the  
island definitely check it out moving on to number 
eight this activity is one of the only places you  
can do this in the entire world and that is swim 
with jellyfish we just got into a Jellyfish lake  
and we're surrounded by jellyfish which is crazy 
and no you're not gonna get stung these jellyfish  
are actually stingless and so you can touch them 
and they'll literally touch you and you don't get  
hurt I don't even know why this is true but it is 
super cool and such a weird experience honestly  
getting in the water we were pretty scared we were 
like are they gonna sting but it's all right it's  
good fun but weird the Jellyfish lake is located 
in sahoten Cove and so you have to do that as a  
package tour I'm going to be telling you about 
southern Cove a bit later in this video right  
let's talk a little bit about transport and how 
to get around if you're looking to get around the  
best way is buy a scooter it just gives you the 
most freedom and if you want to rent a scooter  
the best way to do that is to ask your hotel they 
might rent them themselves or they can point you  
in the right direction we rented ours for 400 
pesos a day you know if you're on a bit more  
of a budget you can probably get it for 300 pesos 
a day so if you're not confident on a scooter you  
can use the classic Filipino tricycles which 
are super cheap and a great way to get around  
and again if you want to do the tours you can do 
land tours and that prevents you having to go on  
a scooter if you're not confident on a bike don't 
push yourselves be careful and wear your helmet  
number nine come eat dinner at Kermit they've got 
amazing cocktails amazing food and even better  
dessert you are not going to be disappointed 
Kermit is a resort and a restaurant and honestly  
it has some of the best food on the island if you 
like pizza if you like pasta then you're going to  
be in for a treat we had an amazing pizza at this 
restaurant and also we tried like this seafood  
linguine pasta and it was Unreal I think it might 
have been the best pasta dish I've ever tried  
they've also got cocktails Gym Bar they've got 
a big old Pizza Oven they've got everything so  
if you like food check it out also if you are 
into yoga then you should do the yoga sessions  
at Kermit Amelia did them and said they were 
super cool with an epic area where you can look  
over their new pool spot number 10 is a spot which 
doesn't have many tourists on it and there's two  
epic beaches near super Lagoon now I'm gonna 
be honest I don't know how to pronounce these  
so please give me a break but I'm gonna give it 
a go for you pamo round Beach which is actually  
part of the super lagoon area and then Kawahagan 
Island and these beaches are absolutely beautiful  
the Kawa Kawahagan island is actually has a 
sandbar and it is super beautiful super clear  
blue water and honestly from the Drone it looks 
even better from both of these beaches you can  
actually eat and there's a restaurant so you can 
have a full day there chilling and you can get  
boats here from the Dell Carmen Port now moving 
on to the next one number 11 this spot is super  
super popular it is like the picture of Siargao 
and the spot that everyone knows about before  
they go and that is the rope swing to get into 
this spot it only costs 20 pesos and it is super  
super fun Unfortunately they don't have the rope 
swing anymore but they've built this like wooden  
kind of jump spot and so you can jump into the 
river but be careful because it is not actually  
that deep on the river it is super cool just along 
this River because there's palm trees either side  
the other thing you can do here is actually get 
a little boat which is super low to the water and  
you go to like this secret little Lagoon and 
once you get there there is like little pigs  
there to go on the little boat ride to the secret 
Lagoon it costs 500 pesos for the boat now moving  
on to number 12 this is a place I promise to tell 
you more about and this is so Sohoton Cove this  
place is magnificent but do be warned it is a 
far away from General Luna I think it took us  
like two hours to get there and then it's like I 
think it took us 3 three hours to get back because  
of the wins and stuff so just be prepared for 
an uncomfortable long ride on the boat and you  
will get wet so maybe bring a waterproof bag 
it costs quite a bit of money especially for  
Filipino standards and it costs 2700 pesos per 
person this obviously includes everything so all  
the fees all the transport as it is very far but 
is well worth it this is where you get to go to  
the Jellyfish lake which I told you about earlier 
and you basically go on a little boat tour around  
the island you also get amazing buffet lunch with 
so much food you won't be able to eat it all and  
then you go to a couple of other spots as well 
we even saw a little Stingray which was pretty  
cool even though this trip is quite expensive I 
do recommend it swimming with the jellyfish going  
around this Raja Ampat kind of area it is so cool 
and worth the money I'll leave a link down in the  
description to go on that tour now I'm going to 
recommend somewhere else that you should eat if  
you're in Siargao and that is Kurvada's this place 
is always super busy and honestly when they run  
out of food they run out of food it's basically 
like a buffet style place and you can choose so  
many different food Filipino food but they also 
do like pasta they even do brownies there is so  
much choice and honestly I don't know how they do 
it but every dish just tastes so so good the other  
great thing about this place it is super cheap 
and affordable so if you are on a budget as a  
Backpacker then I recommend coming here now number 
14 is not a super cool thing to do but one of the  
things to do is to just chill out at the end of 
the day you are on a super chilled surf Island  
Vibe so if you want to just go to the beach you 
just want to chill out in some of the super cool  
cafes get smoothie bowls all day then you can 
do that don't feel like pressured to always do  
loads of stuff whilst you're traveling because 
honestly traveling can be quite exhausting now  
this is probably the most popular tour to do on 
Siargao and that is the island hopping tour the  
Philippines is famous for its island hopping 
tools that this one is super cool and quite  
unique so each island is kind of different first 
of all you've got Naked island and if you don't  
know no you are not naked on that island it's 
just bear there is nothing on it but sand is  
basically a sandbar there's also Daku Island and 
Guyam Island and highly recommend checking these  
out because it is cool who doesn't love island 
hopping in the Philippines having an epic buffet  
lunch you're gonna love these islands now number 
16 is head right up north to the untouristy part  
of the island once you go past the rock pools on 
the island there's not as many tourists the locals  
are super friendly on help you out this island is 
covered in palm trees and you'll be able to go to  
beaches and be the only ones on them there's 
one beach you should check out is that that is  
Algeria Beach right up the north west north east 
and then there's also a waterfall which is the  
only waterfall on the island which we didn't go to 
but I think you should if you're there for quite a  
while now number 17 is the last thing you should 
do in Siargao but I'm actually can just give you  
loads of tips also there are loads of hostels in 
shower gown so if you're on a budget there's loads  
of surf hostels and places you can meet loads 
of people also don't worry about ATMs there are  
loads of ATMs on the island also remember shower 
gal isn't super developed but it is developing  
fast this is going to be the new Bali hopefully 
it doesn't go too far because this place is so  
so beautiful right now but hopefully it won't be 
destroyed by mass tourism guys if you've got any  
questions about shout out please leave them
