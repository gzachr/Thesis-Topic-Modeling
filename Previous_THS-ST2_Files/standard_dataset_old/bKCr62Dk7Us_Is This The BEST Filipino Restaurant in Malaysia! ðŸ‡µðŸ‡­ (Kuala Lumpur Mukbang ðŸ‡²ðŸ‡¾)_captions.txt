it's been about a week and a half since I've
been traveling in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia
and right before this I came straight from
the Philippines and to be honest the first week
that I was here in Malaysia I was craving
Filipino food so someone actually recommended
me to go over to this Filipino restaurant
called Mabuhay Laguna Restaurant and mabuhay
means welcome I did learn that from you guys
so I'm heading over to the restaurant right
now it's a Sunday today and apparently they
have some type of like parties and celebrations
going on Sunday
this is also one of the few Filipino restaurants
here in kl city
apparently there's not too
many so I'm gonna go check it out and eat
my Filipino dishes
so with Malaysia having some of the best food
here in Southeast Asia honestly I want to
say it should be the food capital of Southeast
Asia but there definitely will be a lot of
controversy along that
if you put the restaurant up on Google Maps it'll direct you over to this this building right here
but that is the old location however
if you just turn around with the bright colors
this is Mabuhay Laguna Restaurant
so apparently there's a church around here that ends at
12 p.m on Sundays so it gets kind of crazy
so I got here at 11:30am just because I want
to be able to get a seat inside the restaurant
so they also have rooms here where you can reserve for parties 
there and
here which is cool
so if you have like a birthday or something you can reserve here
so that's ronny
this is his restaurant
oh what do we have here
this is spring spring rolls
what is inside of this meat?
what's inside it like beef or chicken pork
and that is the sisig
sisig is the cheek of the pig
is there a big party today?
sorry? is there a big party today? 
they have some type of functions you know
oh this is probably chili
I love chili and garlic
like the
oh this is really good
and this is a small little shrimp shrimp yeah
this is behind the scenes
hi
how are you
wow
is this like every single dish
just for every dish these
oh this is before adobo
and this is for water spinach
these are also proper Filipino desserts and
snacks here as well 
it looks familiar
oh my gosh there is a balut I don't know if I can have this again
this beautiful lady is eating here like a
balut
balut
this is her first time she eat it
first time she eat it
just just taste the the soup
soup first soup first soup
just taste the soup the soup
it tastes like egg oh my gosh 
i'm not looking at it
so here is also where i guess people come
and sing after church service on sundays
and already you see people sitting down and
in the next 10 or 15 minutes or so I think
more people will be showing up
oh so the table is also reserved for me salamat po
okay so this is the menu
literally got a couple of pages here with
specialties
there's a lot
and this place is also really good for families as well
you got some silog menu
rice egg and noodles
I got myself a celery apple juice
they offered me beer at first but I was like
I could not have beer this early so
and they also have a western food menu option as well
I'm kind of feeling some sisig to be honest
so I might go and order
oh my god there's so many things
sizzling sisig
dang should I get the pork or the chicken
okay I think I'm gonna get the sizzling sisig pork
I definitely want steamed rice with that
oh and they do also have local dishes here as well
but I just want my Filipinos dishes
as a starter I might also get myself
what is this embutido
deep fried Filipino meal I might give myself
an embutido or
so actually all the workers here except for
the owner they're all filipino
so fyi to that
i think they're a little bit busy right now
but I'm just gonna wait and then place my order
so yes I've decided
I will get the sizzling sisig
I don't think I've actually had uh a dessert or the starter dessert like an appetizer in the Philippines so
I guess the first time I'll have that is here
in Malaysia
there's also a lot of posters here
parking is more fun in the Philippines
bananas from the Philippines
rocky roads are more fun in the philippines
generally I think the point that they're trying
to make here is that
it's just more fun in the philppines
even though i'm not filipino I can just tell
that the people here it feels like more of a
community and I guess this is where all
the philippines hang out on the weekends
i do want to order before the crowd comes in here
I don't know how many people will actually show okay but let's see
ate
I'm gonna get the sizzling sisig
sizzling sisig pork
okay also
embutido
what is the difference cause they say they're
both
do you have a favorite like which one is better
no what is this one
oh tofu
okay i will just get the embutido
yeah i'll get that
oh yeah can i have steamed rice
it's exactly 12:00pm right now so church service
is over
and there's going to be a lot of people
showing up here
so I'm walking up the hill to go up to the church
and I kind of want to see this like all the people coming
and how many of them actually will come down over to the restaurant
the flock is coming
they just ended church service up there
uh don't hit me please ah
so this is where all the people are coming
down from church
and it has to be no more than like a two or
three minute walk down to the restaurant
just right across the street people are coming into the restaurant now
but I just kind of wanted to see that
see there's already a lot of people who already showed up here
and i think that's for me
 steamed rice and one steamed pork minced pork
salamat po thank you
I actually never had this meatloaf over in the Philippines before
mm it smells good
they're getting a little bit busy right now
but I need my spices
can I get the uh the chili with the garlic
and soy sauce
yes thank you
alrighty so I got all my dishes
I got the sizzling sisig with the pork
oh it's dripping
I want to show you guys
and then i got to embutido
I've actually never had this before but
there's there's a meatloaf uh starter here so I got that and of course my rice
and I did ask for some chili so I'm going to go and ask
the chili
and then napkins
yes that so
the first thing I always try to do actually
is to take a first bite of the food without
influencing it with any of the sauces
so sizzling sisig
wow
it tastes like the one just in the philippines
oh it's so good
the dish is not complete unless they have
my sauces I'm so annoyingly particular
can I get the chili garlic not powder the pepper like the that
the chili garlic soy sauce
yes thank you
yay yes
salamat po thank you
do you need this
you know how how many peppers I'm gonna
put down?
a lot
alright let's see what i can do here
honestly he gave me a spoon
but I might just like dump it
alright so your girl got herself a big bowl of pepper
soy sauce
I do want garlic but I don't want to bother them again
I'm just gonna make this make all together
I will say though I think Malaysia has spicier sauces than the Philippines so
Malaysia spice reminds me the most like Thailand
and Thailand spice was honestly perfect for me
let's see ah i'm so excited
okay I'm gonna steal someone's napkins actually
be right back
okay I just stole somebody's napkins
okay so I took a bite of this sisig
that is crack
so good
alright this meatloaf they also gave
um
it smells like a sweet a sweet spicy sauce
also so
let's try this
it's like a sweet meatloaf
what is that inside
it looks like a spam or something
but it's pretty sweet
it's good
but I'm going to for sure eat this with pepper
it's good
so actually here in southeast asia in general
when I first would ask for chili
I would just say pepper
and in america
this chili
the red chili here
we call this pepper
I guess it's because the name of this is called
Thai Bird's Eye Chili
but there was actually one time where I went to a restaurant
and I asked if I could have pepper and he gave me like the pepper flakes
and I was like oh no not that one
but it's funny
oh
thank you
aw she gave me a whole thing of tissues instead
because i just asked a random table because i didn't want to bother them
meatloaf is good with the dipping sauce that they give but
I like my food extra extra spicy with
everything
yum the sisig
I think
the meatloaf with the dish is like
adding a good finishing touch
I asked the owner I was like what percentage
of people here are filipinos and he said
more than 90% of people who actually come here
and dine in on sundays are filipinos
if i were to compare dishes
because I've never had meatloaf in the Philippines
I don't know how to compare it but this sisig
is really spot on
it tastes like I'm really in the Philippines right now
 karaoke?
is it loud?
okay so I will tell them
that they can put it on
because I think a lot of people do come here for karaoke
and I don't want to be the reason why they don't enjoy their weekend
I wonder if they sell chili bird eye with
Thai Bird Eye Chili in the U.S
because this has been a part of my diet for the last six months and I don't know if I can eat food without it
honestly it's amazing so good
I think my spice tolerance has definitely
gone up
it was already pretty high before I came to
asia but it's definitely more now
I will say also proportion
this sisig is probably good for one
meatloaf if you're here with someone else
that you can share it
but it's really good
I'm really glad I came here
it's like
also before I ever came to the Philippines
I've only had Filipino food like twice in my life
I don't know why I never really came across
um as a dish that I was curious to taste
but I'm actually really excited to go home
and try out all of the foods from all the
countries I've gone to and I actually see
the difference
I think my time up here in Southeast Asia
is still TBD but I have a better understanding
of when I have to go home
and yeah
what a journey
what a year it's been
like I've been here for the last six months
and I think it finally
has occurred to me that my body is slowly just wearing out
I'm not posting as much as I was when I first
was here
um I find myself more tired every day and
sometimes I just want to do nothing but
sometimes it's also difficult when you enjoy
creating content a lot
but you know that you should give yourself
a break sometimes
yeah thank you
he was also saying too that usually when people
sing karaoke here that they'll stay the whole night
I don't know if I will be able to stay the
whole night but
I want to definitely see it
and now I totally understand why people here
in asia eat rice in the morning
at first I was like
I don't know anyone who does that
but I get it now
this sisig is really really good
it's crack
like I could probably eat this every day
there we go
karaoke
I'm like sitting right in front of the music
so everyone's kind of looking at me now
so I guess the karaoke goes whenever someone
wants to sing and that was cool
it was just like this girl was singing
and then the whole entire restaurant just
kind of like stopped what they were doing
and was watching her sing
that's cool
almost all the tables are full
that's crazy
I have a feeling here maybe you can fit like
40 people in the main room, 50 maybe?
i'm also trying to eat slowly
so I can have everything
this is a random side note but
I was talking to a couple of locals not just
here in Malaysia
but in other countries like Thailand and
they were saying how they miss food from home
like the home is in Asia
and in the U.S they tried to find like local
Thailand food or something and they were saying
how they just weren't able to find food that
tasted as good as home so they opted in for
Mexican food
and now I totally understand why because Mexican
food they use a lot of lime and everything
is so flavorful
it's interesting because I think being here
in Southeast Asia has made me appreciate my
country more
and everything that is there
not just the food
but just like the people and opportunities
and the lifestyle
they also took the chili away from me but
I kind of want more
if you are here in kl city
there's a lot of a lot of type of food restaurants
and dishes to try
like all over the city but
if you are looking for Filipino food
Mabuhay Laguna Restaurant is a good choice
not only is the food here really good but
there's also a type of community here
so if you're here and you're curious I would
recommend coming here on a Sunday
try to get here a little bit before noon because
starting from 12 o'clock it gets a little
bit more packed here because the church service
ends and people just end up coming here straight
directly so
this is probably the last time I will probably
also have Filipino food until I get back to
the states to be honest because I'm hopping
over countries
so in the next month I'm actually going to be
going to three other countries so
it's going to be a journey
but if my body doesn't wear out
I hope to make more travel vlogs
uh at a at a pretty good pace at posting them
everything was so good i'm so full
thank you oh my gosh I shouldn't have taken
the last two bites
my stomach is going to expand
this restaurant was also reviewed by Time
Out Magazine in KL
ok so
i was abrout to leave and then i saw someone
order this dessert
so this is called a halo halo
and i've never had this before in the philippines
but apparently this is the filipino version
of ice kachang
so i don't know where ice kachang originated from
but it is dessert and I really needed something
sweet so
okay ice cream
stir?
the bottom?
halo halo
what is this brown thing?
this is uh how do i call it
it looks like jelly
like jelly worms
it tastes like jelly you know jelly
oh yeah i was right it's like jelly jelly
this is uh egg pudding
egg pudding
and then that's mango?
no that's
like a jackfruit
oh jackfruit okay
so egg pudding
egg pudding
I will
jackfruit
so actually I had Jackfruit over in Vietnam
and I got an allergic reaction
i don't think i could eat it but I'm probably
gonna eat it anyway
okay he said to mix it but I just kind of
want to eat it without mixing it first
wow what is this
okay there's beans at the bottom
okay beans and this like jelly
this kind of tastes like a Korean 빙수
so 빙수 is basically a shaved ice with like
condensed milk and fruit and chocolate like
this so
I guess this is the philippines version of it
I also asked for no sugar because in Malaysia
I swear this country loves sugar andn everything
has sugar in it so I'm just trying to not
have as much sugar because I don't really
generally like additive sugar so my body is
just reacting to it a lot
it's a very like good end taste for
dessert
try the egg pudding
yeah it's good it tastes like egg pudding
it definitely will have a sweeter taste obviously
with the sugar
but this is like perfect perfect
I think this is also something you can share
with two people
but let's see if finish it
okay i'm a rebel
i just ate the jackfruit
i don't really care
wow the jackfruit here is really good
I'm so incredibly full
I probably finished like half of it
I can't stop but really last bite and I'm
done I cannot
oh my I'm so full
that was good
finito
finished
this is ronny
he is owner here at Mabuhay Laguna Restaurant
and he has educated me everything I probably
now know about Malaysia
