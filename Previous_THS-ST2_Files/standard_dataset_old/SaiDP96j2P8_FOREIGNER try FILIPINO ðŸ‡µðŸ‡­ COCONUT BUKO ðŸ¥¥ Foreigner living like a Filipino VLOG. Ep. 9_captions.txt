Good morning from the Philippines.

Pick buko, because only father knows how to pick buko. Young coconut right
Before only grandfather he knows, but unfortunately he passed 
away. So father he can do it now
Wow, already!
very quick very skilled

Another one. So this is like half 
liter of water inside or more one liter
One liter. wow so if we don't 
have water we can drink this that's good
How is it?
Refreshing yeah actually it's a little bit 
cold.
Yeah it's cold even it's on the tree 
How is it?

I put some here
You finished all here. You're very hungry! Delicious!
Coconut
This is my lunch
Are you sure?
It's delicious as well with the sugar
But this buko is not so juicy because it's 
not brown. Now it is only young, green. 
It will be more juicy when it is brown.   
There is not milk yet, only water.
But when it comes to brown, there will be no taste the water.
