Hello and welcome back to my brand new channel
I was destroying everything
how come
every time that I start to record
something have to happen?! 🤨
okay
let's do it again
hi my beautiful people
Here I am my name is Lucia Sinatra I am
a singer songwriter performer and vocal
coach but first of all I am i singer
yes and I want to react to the beautiful
and most talented people on this earth
from the street to the big stages at the
moment we are doing big stages because
you know it's more easier I have a lot
of talents that I would love to share
with you that probably nobody knows we
are going to do the super reacts about
your face sounds familiar kids to t
empty boys what does it mean t auntie
please let me know! okay we are going
randomly
what they did to them! 😊
Oh
they are great dancers
okay I have to say something good it's
it looks weird to me watching kids
dressing like girls and have this
attitude but it's amazing it's a
showtime, right?
okay let's go on they are cute they are
super cute I got it
but I want to go on with other
performances but I want to go on with
other performances but I wanted to be
shocked okay now they are doing jessie j
ariana grande nicki minaj BANG BANG
oh my God let's see what they are doing
here
live is very hard
this guy sounds like
Ariana a little bit ..Wow
where did they find them?
okay what I
think is that all the stage stuff and
the costumes are very distracting from
their talents they are very talented
they also have have attitude and swag
and .. Wow let me go on and
check other performance I want to do
it in this okay
noway! Lady Marmalade 😍
Aguilera pink and Mia
I love this one
yes the costumes for sure just because
they are kids and they are male are very
distracting from the talents they have
it's fun but if you only hear you can
feel the talent if you watch you will be
distracted
and also you know what they actually
made a good job with them they cure a
lot the details of the video and they are singing it with high heels
I want to hear AGUILERA
what's HIS NAME? what's name of this one? Wow
yeah got it
yeah let's got one other performance
The Supremes can't hurry love or Boyz II men & Mariah Carey ? ..yes this one
it's very distracting the costume but
this is the format so .. it's fine
I don't know how the kid will do the low
notes because it's very hard
the bearb!
do Mariah Carey's parts is very very hard
because she keeps switching
from chest to airy and head voice so could be struggling for for him
Exactly this guy is notconscious of what he is doing because Mariah Carey used to switch from chest
to airy to head voice in one phrase so
it's like
and it's very very hard technically and she used to do her great runs so
okay here too: 🎙🎙🎙🎙
let's see what will happen
okay nice let's switch to another one
ABBA MAMMAMIA Three Tenors "Oh sole mio"
let's go with this one
perfect pronunciation perfect this is not even Italian this is a dialect
they are perfect
L'aria fresssca like Napolitano
let's remember these are kids 11 12 years old
this is something wow!
Carreras Domingo & Pavarotti
they are so so so cute they are fabulous
next reaction of TNT boys I will do it
with my son because he's 9 years old my
son likes Jackson 5 and would be nice to
see his reaction to them and you know
what it's very hard to sing
in this range for a kid I mean this opera
lyrical classical way to round the voice
is not so easy and you should have a very
strong diaframma sometimes they were
breathless but they did a great job
great! The customer this time
didn't distract me too much probably because I know a lot this performance
done from the Maestros this was a very
very great super super react to tnt boys
I love them I'm a huge fan they are 11 and 12 years old let me know their names! 🙏🏼
they are born to be on stage yes they
are !!
Beautiful people for this video is
it I am so glad that you spent your time
with me and TNT boys
from my studio
to all of you ciao ciao
