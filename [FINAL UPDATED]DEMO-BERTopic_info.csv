do like one of them will be really savvy I think like the DJing things and then they put the thing to that level would be like that I love I you be surprised a lot of the times it just is their own mixes This is the highest level Yeah that is yes yeah and that was something I was very impressed about like you know Obviously the Philippines has a very high pedigree of singers and I think worldwide They they have been known and now you know even more than ever it being known as some of some of their best singers and power vocalists In the world and then it turns out as well that theyve always been known in the dance community as Some of the most respectable yeah well classeddowns Yeah I mean I know theres like the job job Ill walk you the job of walkies Yeah Im familiar Ive seen some of their work Theyre awesome They went viral so much in like Yeah they have like masks Yeah yeah But yeah thats all I knew basically and then when we did the Filipino dance special we sort of understood a bit more But I guess I took that that podcast more like learning more about the culture cultural side of dance Because I was very intrigued to see you know a singing is such a part of the culture Perhaps is there other forms in which art has translated itself through a history or and its culture and obviously dance It seems to be a huge deal about it Thats amazing though but yeah I wonder how like how they come about about the mix of the I reckon they have someone I mean it is a very music savvy industry Yeah So yeah some of the dancers cant but Id imagine come on It has to also be like I think like what makes you bring to the competition also has to be like Its huge deal right Its a huge element I would think that they would thats also something that you judge It probably goes in this order Choreography right Yeah performance music It has its the top three Yeah its the top three most important I dont know where they criteria is in the hiphop international but listen listen I will think that thats a huge deal and the plenty of like you know good good I dont know what would you what would you need for this like a DJ Yeah you would have to yeah you would have a DJ Im good producers in the Philippines So Im sure they can fuck I mean they won right so they cant help with something clean Usually in dance battles like in smaller scales than this you have a DJ that plays their own mix Yeah I see that movie just dance Oh my god Thats the only thing I know not Ive seen YouTube videos as well Okay Do you know those YouTube videos to go viral Yeah they go like you what Nobody does Everyone said who I wonder why hes gonna reply and then I dont know that I dont know what was next the video We always cut that oh because its the best moment Maybe they reply was rather Unclimactic yeah if its not in the video what do you win just respect And money sometimes yeah Yeah yeah depending on the competition like the most Depending on the competition Depending on the

should have took it over to the porch to plug it in Thats full charge but you know the batteries Yeah That goes to help him Okay its about James is here This is the finished product We just put the sand and the dirt and the euro at the bottom and put the rocks here so I can turn in And I got a nice wide turn Looks good Were just going to get packed down as we turn in here Its a good job James So now what were just going to do is start here before he takes this Hes going to go all the way down clean it up the greens and break it up the brown leaves and the garbage Im just going to come back on this side here all the way over here all the way down I just spend the rest of his day to day and then tomorrow probably So and then Ben had like or Ladies show up here just before I walked out here with James I was like uhoh But fortunately for me theyre with the theyre from San Antonio Municipal Office The barangay that doing the health census like we do in the States Theres like eight of them show up and they come and they start walking on the land over there and going to the Kubo Come and ask them questions Im like well Im like see no coyote And then they said oh sorry were from the barangay were from the health department Were what did they say profiling I was like profiling You know Im thinking criminal profiling Im like what What did I do Its just a driveway Just sand and rucks But anyway it wasnt that its just a census just happened to happen today Still no wiki the bulldozer guy even though he said the message was coming today So probably what Im going to I dont know Im thinking about if hes not here by this afternoon my first thought was just to message him say just never mind You can come and get your payment for what youre done I just dont want to be strung out like this I dont like it Most people dont like being strung out You know okay whenever whenever whenever Theres nothing wrong with us expecting you to be here on time Theres nothing wrong with us expecting you to be here when you just say youre going to be here We live in the country by choice We choose to be here You know we just want to respect you and want you guys to respect us Our time is just as valuable as your time you know for the Filipino people Its just sometimes frustrating but Im not upset I just going to debate whether or not Im going to move on without him and do it with shovels I just keep this delay again going on Theres a couple of the ladies in the tricycle Okay byebye Theres two of them Theres a whole gaggle up over there on my front porch I dont know why it takes so many to all ladies So well see I just thought it odd them showing up the same day Im doing all this So who knows Maybe somebody went over and said hey the foreigners putting dirt and sand down on the highway which I wasnt Im just putting them on the common way into the house So thats probably the problem with them Weve been over to the barangay several times getting several clearances several requests Weve told them every time were over here and no ones ever come out in the past year So now that were living here maybe they decided okay because weve already hooked up electricity trying to talk to the water company This is by now hes going to go pick up Sabrina for the lunch hour So anyway I still got a whole bunch of people over there', 'Bella very busy Good morning Another day another dollar Okay today Im going to start with installing the street light Just over the veranda We need to get that done Okay So lets do that Lets mark the position And also I want to say that one of my neighbors has got a light that goes into our face here Very high position But what Im going to do here Im not going to put like this like most street light are What Im going to do Im going to put this way Opposite way because I want the light to go on to my house not in the neighbors house And I got to put in this corner here of the house So that should eliminate all this area and that area as well Like I always say lights is like a fence So I installed this this is my tool this is going to use Im going to probably predrill a little bit because those posts are very very tough Mahogany very hard to screw things in And Im going to use a set of theyre really panel roof screw with a washer And I will do plenty plenty strength there I know where Im going to put this on Im going

standing out here in the back door Over here is where they took some of the sand So thats my S sand that was here from before Glad we finally got a use for it They still got some work to do because theyve been focusing there on the septic Because theyve been focusing the efforts here So the plan is here since we got our water here Were going to go one line straight out towards there Theyre going to dig a pit out there concrete it leave it bottomless And any of the filtered water from the three chamber septic tanks Going to reach this way out there Now then to the creek in that direction Passed our water source on that side And then thats where its going to settle in Theyre a little research here And a lot of people here locally do it that way And it functions very well Again like I said I expect three and a half since its so big Maybe I could probably go up to five to six years if theres no problem before we pump it But well see Thats why we have the openings here Well put the lid on so we can pump it in the future It needs me Okay Let me see what else updates I can get here Oh yeah I see these days working the edges now Now its standing Im jumping high I have one Starting on the edges so were getting there And thats the root one And well follow the way all the way out to here The edges over here Over here So they got able to edge it out here And were going to do the grout later on The layout J is working Looks like the column area Maybe in the back lets see Lets follow the young man Is he going to make the column Okay Theres cutting over there and hes doing the placement here There we go Looks like some cover Let me cover some of this a little bit here Still that more to do Let me go back over here Hopefully I dont know There tomorrow maybe theyll be done with all the edges here So process they got a measuring cut measuring cut measuring cut At least theres two of them up here now And well see how theyre going to do it And were going to do the same And were going to do the same And were going to do the same And were going to do the same And were going to do the same Were going to do the same And well see how theyre going to do this with the railings here Get some new bother See what they have to do Measure it Cut it Semito rip it over and put it down Tap it if need be Thats why it takes the time consumption there Were getting there so I think its probably the mall So shes pretty straight out of way to go We got the younger the younger the older the more much time its done the more I bought that So its a great time to come to Florida We cant really step out of the noise Back in the year Okay cool your ferdinand Just in front of with him Hes cutting these pieces here and its going to go up here This is a before look and Im sure you guys have seen it before And come down And look at the little stuff that I just did And its done But Im going to go to Florida again Weve got beautiful Beautiful Im going to start this Its a nice work for it But now making the cut And doing a larger one Thats a good thing Oh beautiful Thats cool Im going to do that without an eye protection Im going to ask the question to make sure we got enough panels

bus Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Setting flutes off the school This song they always sing This is the one This is one of the Theres like a set few wherever you are youll hear specific songs in the Philippines and karaoke And this is definitely one of them This is one of them Im thinking things yet but Im in the beginning but Ill send it in like When we fade in like a little tiny little place A little village in Port Barton And we were at the top of it Our room was upstairs And The neighbors Here karaoke All day All night Im singing this But hes a lot better', 'Sothas Asians are great at singing And love to sing Yeah Yeah Yeah Actually Totally Oh yes Thats true Not me Yeah Oh I like to

after all this time Im still into you Wow Good voice I might sing Not good But I love to sing them Okay Youll take on that Yeah I mean weve mentioned this Very very often Especially in the past And something that is super super common here Are dedicated video karaoke Yeah but also just people walking down the street singing Yeah just wherever you go Outside you will always hear somebody singing randomly Sometimes its just the How to say bank Empty or like God Anybody Literally anybody So thats one of the things that I think its a truth Im not a great singer And I dont like to sing But sometimes when we drink We like to sing along especially Mike Yeah theres actually a very cool vlog Where we were in Baguio And we were drinking and singing While we were grilling with a few locals Its quite awesome well link the video right here', 'Yeah this is my first time actually reacting to Filipino music And honestly it was just dope I love all types of music If I had to pick a favorite I think white rabbit was my favorite The aesthetic everything singing I loved it out of The third one BGYO had a nice message in it Sometimes I was a bit confused Im not gonna lie A lot of the time something was happening And I wanted to say about something else that was happening But something else was happening was confusion But it was fine Dance with me was just grubby like that is the issue just like a song you play at a party That was just some good music I enjoyed it I think its pretty clear like Im about to add all of these songs to my playlist I think its an absolutely amazing genre I love the fact that a lot of the songs are really meaningful The music is actually good And the song just always gets better and better And then youve got the amazing dancing and the vibes This music is just amazing The Philippines never fails to surprise in a good way And Im so happy that I got to listen to these songs today And theyre just absolutely amazing I like that second being in the most Oh yeah that was really cool I think I like the melody the most from this one And then I like the dance from the first one the most Yeah thats true I like that too I want to learn that But the visuals from the second video Yeah But theyre all really good like theyre all making me think like why I find a very interesting one And I really want to add that song in my playlist Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah it was really nice Okay which one did you like the most I think the second one The second Yeah Because I loved the music video so much And I really liked her voice when it was like a high voice I think I liked the first one the most Because the song the dance the guys Everything was of a And I was actually vibing with the song Second one she was really pretty like Jill And the last one just gave me some cape vibes But the guys I prefer the guy in the first video Oh yeah In the last video there was a guy looking in the mirror And I was like Stop saying things for the tattoo Yeah So what are your thoughts on the piano music I didnt expect actually to like it that much as I liked it And I didnt expect such a creativity in music videos All of them are Yeah I think theres more versatility in the music than like Kpop Well Im trying to compare it to Kpop Because I feel like I know Kpop a little bit better But like I feel like Kpop is very focused on the visual aspect of the music video And it seemed like a trend that I saw in all three of them Is that they like really cared about like this cinematography and like that And stuff like that In terms of the music though I would agree that theres like a lot of range between the three Like theyre all different genres I think its also because they like purposely chose three different genres Just to like show the different kinds of vibes that you can get Something that I also really liked was I feel like theres songs Well like some of the first ones that I do have like good meaning Yeah the first one was like This dance like its drunk And then the second one Its like where am I Like yeah like I need to find myself And then the third ones like the your own light The your own light The your own light I do want to do that Honestly I really liked it I didnt know what I was like Yeah I didnt know what I like to expect but I really enjoyed it Im a very big fan of the second girl I think shes like it makes sense that shes also an actress Shes so pretty Shes so beautiful God were not talking about the other one Were just standing over her Im always so straight']"

hours But yeah once youre doing a bunch of other stuff and then you do an obstacle course like every little obstacle even every little part of the obstacle is just going to feel super miserable am recruits have to complete a kilometer Rucksack march They havent slept in over hours Even worse they will have to carry kilograms of gear on their So kilos with you know kilometers doesnt seem too bad but again you have to think with the weather you know possibly the environment their boots might get wet their socks might get wet Once your socks are wet then your feet are going to get torn up And of course theyre going to be super like destroyed At this point theyre like probably walking zombies because theyre too tired and they probably cant pay too much attention to whats going on They march as a team but its an individual assessment am For Recruit its as much a mental battle as physical pain I feel better having like a reporter there on a camera Theres less than two hours left but the strain of kilograms is showing It hurts Oh man kilometers The march comes to a halt But these exhausted recruits dont know whats coming next It has all been a ruse For the most feared test yet escape innovation is about to start Oh jeez Its an exercise where students get a chance to feel what its like being caught by the enemy Recruits will be held captive and treated And theyre going to be able to get the chance to get the chance to get the chance to feel what its like being caught by the enemy Recruits will be held captive and treated Recruits will be held captive and treated as prisoners of war Thats bad Its a reality that could happen in just three months when they go into real battle Sure So in the Marine Corps theyd play like small mental games with hiking You know you would go maybe kilometers but when you hit kilometers when you get to that finishing point you start going a little bit further And just that small thing starts messing with people But this is a completely different level And again you can imagine theyre super tired at this point Theyre super disoriented and all of a sudden theyre going to be like a prisoner So man its crazy how they do like different levels You know you have like no sleep You know youre hungry youre tired and not all of a sudden youre a prisoner Right Robbed of their vision their binds their position to maximize pain Yeah it looks like it We dont do this to traumatize our recruits We do this to remind them never get caught by the enemy Because the enemy will show no mercy on them And eventually theyll be killed Scout Ranger recruits have endured nine weeks of physical hell But nothing could have prepared them for this Escape and evasion For the next hours recruits will be subjected to various forms of torture The aim is to make them fear capture I experience a big land a cagulet we dont have to be afraid of anything We have to be afraid of the enemy Its like the enemy is afraid of the enemy Its like theyre trying to kill us Its a matter of luck Its like a war But its like a war Its like a war Its like a war Its like a war Its like a war We dont have to be afraid of the enemy We dont have to be afraid of the enemy For recruits its a brutal lesson in survival I think your loyalty to your country is really being tested You will realize you will give information to the enemy once you experience pain Its been hours since the recruits were captured What happens during this time is top secret Yeah Not fun I can just imagine that It was really one of the worst experiences if not the worst experience of my life', 'Do it in honor of those who sacrificed their lives for freedom Masid proudly presents the battle of Yulhton a story of how Filipino troops Brave a sea of Chinese soldiers during the Korean War the

were blocked by a platoon of Filipino soldiers situated on a hill overlooking I see you know shooting from the hell that worked well Wow good strategy Commended by Lieutenant Jose Artyaga this platoon refused to yield held their ground This gave Lieutenant Artyagas company commander Captain Conrado Yap Enough time to mount a counterattack The counterattack successfully extracted the trapped platoon

years actually youre barely man what are you talking about years yeah yeah so first time here was and let me tell you back then the city was completely different yeah I say undiscovered okay um Manila was the place to go at the time in Cebu was um this littleknown area of the Philippines where it was like up and coming IT park for example had nothing but Playing Fields nobody was there that was like one building wow um so A lots changed in years as you can imagine yeah and the reason why I keep coming back is because Im married to a Filipina we just cant get enough of the Philippines obviously the lifestyle here is what draws Us in year after year because winter sucks um and we dont want to be there for longer than we have to definitely as much as possible we come here um especially during winter and we just tour around we go to places like Palawan ball um and also neighboring countries but if youre a traveler and you want to go somewhere that is easier to live in because you know youre American and you dont want to just go to some place that is a degree flip I think Philippines is a great fit like thats what drew me here because that its a good Englishspeaking country it has a lot of the same familiarities that youre used to so its a good jumping off point if you want to live abroad and still feel like youre connected to your home country got it man thank you so much now did you meet your wife in the Philippines or in the US I met her here okay yeah I came here for vacation because I I didnt even know Philippines existed um yeah until the vacation it was because a coworker saw my desktop with my desktop had this you know really pretty white sand Blue Water picture okay thats where I want to go one day and she quickly said you got to go to the Philippines yeah um and she told me all about it and you know she had family here so she said you can meet my family um you know theyll show you around so I did that I took advantage of it um and it was a great decision because Ive been coming back ever since thats incredible man all these positive things anything negative or anything that could be improved maybe in the Philippines of course no countrys perfect oh yeah yeah theres lots of it Im not gonna sugarcoat it yeah vacationing here is very different from living here um so if you plan on being here for like a month or longer you should definitely do your research there are lots of good Facebook groups for foreigners looking to relocate so I would definitely check those out um because theres going to be a lot of adjustments Im not gonna lie all the Comforts youre used to in the US um youre gonna have to let that go and you know very quickly you can get bogged down by some of the negatives so it takes a lot of um courage and determination and fortitude to come here and stay here yeah and get passed through all the negatives um and some of the negative just to name a few um traffic is a big one uh youre gonna get stuck in traffic a lot especially if youre here living here yeah the commute is gonna be um its gonna be a pain yeah um Im not gonna lie and then also theres a lot of um really negative people who have been living here for a long time like I myself have been living here for a long time but I managed to find ways to stay grounded yeah and positive which is kind of hard to do because uh the government the bureaucratic BS um daytoday grind of living here um youre gonna have to put up with a lot of red tape and just getting the simple things done is going to be difficult internet if youre like me and youre in the tech world and you need to work from home uh best believe you are going to be dealing with a lot of Internet issues and let me tell you I struggle for a very long time to get some stable internet going yeah uh but in the last few years thats been changing so fiber optics has been um becoming more and more of a mainstream option for a lot of folks here about it so luckily I think thats finally turning a corner okay and uh tell me if you could describe the Philippines in just one word I know its difficult but its kind of the Philippines in one word um one word or one phrase one statement um I would say fun but dangerous you know some people like danger and last question are you a Celtics fan Celtics um I was a Celtic fan lately I havent been watching sports but you know I get asked that question all the time Im telling you because Im tall yeah um if youre tall be prepared to be asked that question like five times a day yeah are you a basketball player all right man

uh what about dating so whats dating like in the Philippines compared to the US uh I want to say its kind of like the same where like women still want you to be like financially stable yeah they want they prefer doing with a lot of money hypergly but the thing is is that out here you can have like a little bit of money and still be considered Like You Know Rich yeah as opposed to in the states women want you to make like half a million its getting pretty ridiculous these days right you need to play in in the NBA to accomplish yeah I know right were all living in a fantasy world right I think yeah well thank you for sharing that what about any discrimination have you felt anyone looking at you in like weird way or um yeah I mean Ive gotten some looks uh but I think its somewhat natural I dont take it as offensive because um I think Ive Im like the only uh minority that Ive seen out here other than you of course uh but normally if I do see a foreigner theyre normally

food', 'food']","['Well I mean since you mentioned that right like you have business you youre a chef or a chef So regarding like Nigerian food and Filipino food Im very curious to like from you know a chefs perspective is a cuisine more or less like the same on par But before we go into that I want us to move on to our second meal which is be called Express So would be called Express Its made up of like coconut milk which brings a sense of delight to the sharp notes of chili pepper and baguon in the classic recipe So the contrast is longcreated its wellbinding richness and tastes for the dish And it also is arguably one of the most popular Filipino dishes So I knew in Niger a person eat already like spicy food Yeah So the reason why I love people Express is because its spicy in my opinion So I want to like he thinks it as well So just Ive tried Biko Las for a while and this is one of my best Filipino food just because its spicy Yeah So Im trying to make it spicier the better Make it spicier you automatically like it Yeah So just this one pretty clear because theyre all theyre like spicy Its easy can be spicy Yeah its easy because its also spicy but this is very good Oh its good Right Maybe its easy can be spicy Yeah Yeah But I think yeah I think Bikos Express is my most favorite like spicy food You know the shine just really its different I think maybe also like the coconut milk I mean yeah coconut milk definitely has like especially rice At least for me yeah We have rice over there if you want to add it Yeah We asked a question earlier about the difference between Nigerian food and Filipino food So the difference is Nigerian food are more spicier like pepper you call it pepper you have a lot of pepper down food and Filipino food are good and delicious Just that you guys have a lot of sugar it was a bit dishes and I cant do Yeah thats the staple Like we dont have like they do add was it called sugar and some dishes like I think its a different type Theres some different kind of stuff Yeah its a little longer People dont spike it Lets spike it you know Ill never forget it Like like no The foods are good Trust me just that Im not used to number two Hand sugar in my food Like the difference is the sugar and the spiciness level because I do sense of Filipinos and some of them like I dont want to be spicy Yeah I dont want to be spicy They get I think thats the difference but they are all good', 'Out of these two I dont know if its a starving or what Im telling you right now the food in America I feel like cannot compare to food in other countries Because like America is the one of the most like unnatural processed food like country I feel like in the world So the fact that like the people that I bought this from I bet you they grow all of this naturally And they dont use any preservatives or like growth hormones in America We might be wrong about that but I might be wrong Yeah This could just be a knockoff There might be people that come to me like yo thats not it But like from what she told me like she knew what she was talking about Yeah Okay so I think my alltime favorite are these The Oh is it so good The lumpia The lumpia will be I

around Philippine you know from what I taste on the food side out of Oh The ice cream was amazing Im a little like I think I would buy you guys About the beans There were beans in the bottom Yeah I dont think I would ask for none of that stuff on the bottom The ice cream was fire though I can probably tell that the ice cream was like amazing But all around out of out of I would never even have guessed Weve never had Philippine like traditional Filipino food up until now I was my first time Maybe we have in the past and we never knew we were eating it But like One place in Chicago Illinois

morning guys welcome back to my last tour Its a very early Ish start this morning Its locked Its locked Today like we said last night we are heading to a new island and that island is where I think you all know very well Its become very famous for a lot of photos online Its possibly the best sand bar in the world from what we see and that is Kalank me and island I might be pronouncing it wrong Weve actually booked our tour through a dive school next door to us You can book it Theres a lot of locals at there as well but they all offer it for around a thousand pesos Its entry Its got to be the most expensive island to visit to enter even I think its for a reason it is incredible We actually paid about pesos extra each to do it with a dive school but that includes your lunch entry fee the lot So we have our towels two towels for the day Actually next door to our hotel is where we booked it Its sea explorers so were going to go there now Its actually a dive centre and there is everyone getting ready for their dive I still dont think I could ever do it even if I had a padded ice Thats coming next year Im definitely going to do my paddy next year Im so excited I think they said I can do it in Batangas so Im thinking maybe in the new year I think theres a few paces that you can do it But we have a big boat I think theres more people on it now today which is even better for us because we were really worried that it wasnt going to go ahead The sea is very rough so we might have to put the camera away We are all checked in Weve just got to wait for the small light shuttle boat because its a bit rough today Weve got to go in that Its taken us round to the bigger boat because the big boats cant come here Theyre not getting stuck on shore which happens to us when we arrive on our ferry from the mainland But its here Weve ran to the front like up a little school children because theyre all excited Im sure we might make sure that we can get to a bit where its going to be like a dry enough Its quite a big boat that you get to go on I think it just takes you around the corner of the island to where the sea isnt as rough So its absolutely huge You could pretty much live on the air right The other boat was super bumpy but this I cant feel the waves at all Weve had to retreat inside a kitchen area of the boat It was extremely rough Well take on quite far the waves are just taking an overview Ive got a faculty which is actually going everywhere as weve been Were just sitting back and enjoying the ride I think its an hour and a half and hopefully quick because everything is getting so thin You need to see the size of this boat though Weve got a smoking area a slash kitchen area at the back and then it leads all the way through Weve got the captain weve got a toilet over there Theres about seats to this side There is an inside area which we may have to go on if it gets rough You come all the way to the front You have the front of the boat comes round all the way down and then the same all the way to the other side This has got to be the biggest boat weve been on Definitely worth it for the sake of an extra pesos You get to the island so much quicker', 'Now its almost sunset time Its probably pm And the sunsets maybe in an hour hour and a half So what a lot of people do around this time around Las Cabanhas are coronacoroncoronbeaches They go get a good seat for the sunset Which is probably going to be good Its a clear day So hopefully we get a good sunset Weve got a few good spots for you But its really incredible Its definitely what you want to do when youre around these beaches here All right So now were going to walk back And this is our path This is our road here To go back Oh look at this view We got it right here guys Youre not going to be able to see it as well as us But that genuinely does not look real And I think were going to have our sunset over here So if you see right here theres a restaurant right on that corner So thats a popular spot If youre on Las Cabanhas that everyone goes and gets a seat now for the sunset that were going to have in about an hour And they start there Start their holiday Start their booze and start their eating But Im also a big fan of coronacoroncoronbeaches And Ive said this in other videos But coronacoroncoronbeaches over there And theres a place called Panorama which has a great view of this as well And its perfectly designed for watching a sunset as well Just like this one But this of course is going to be a perfect spot for it Look at that It just doesnt look real So I was telling you this a few days ago when you were talking about corona And I said I prefer it here Because you get this from where you can get your restaurants and hotels And you dont have this in Koran Koran town doesnt look like this You have to take a boat and go somewhere to get used to like this Exactly You cant go to the Philippines unless you have halohaloh And a coconut So were going to try our best combined halohaloh and a coconut Can I get halohaloh inside a coconut Ill put it in the rice Its too hot Its delicious Im happy to pay Okay I will want also I will be out of two So two halohaloh is in a coconut How much would that cost for halohaloh in a coconut Oh yes Delicious Its a little amount of pot Oh okay Are we doing something secretive Okay thats fine Thats okay So unfortunately we cant watch her make the halohaloh because her boss doesnt want us to see the secret halohaloh recipe But thats fine We still get to eat the halohaloh But this is absolutely mandatory in the Philippines So lets rate this one and see how good it is It will be good Oh Oh We have a beautiful Of course Thank you Whats your hold this one Okay Were taking Were having a photo shoot You want to You want me to Yeah Hey Im going to hold back short coconut Thank you I dont think on any of my videos Ive ever eaten thats not true I ate halohaloh in one video a year ago And everyone got mad at me because I didnt mix it Halohaloh means mix mix I think in Tagalog right And so what youre supposed to do is mix all of the ingredients before you eat it Usually halohaloh is served not in coconut So we got it in a coconut The ingredients are I dont know what Im going to say ice cream probably Flakes of coconut some sort of shaved ice Corn Im now founding all of these gummies Weve got red and green Christmas colors All right weve got banana mystery ingredients We couldnt see what she put in here but thats all I see so far Yeah So Im going to do what Im supposed to do and Im going to mix mix Halohaloh mix mix it And when you eat it on a hot beach you got to be quick So it doesnt melt too soon Lets go ahead and get a bite with all the ingredients with the ube ice cream the coconut the pieces of corn Oh we got it Its good Its really good Once you get the shaved ice the ice cream and the coconut flakes in there the corn if Im honest its a little odd The corn flavor with the anything else Lets get a piece with the banana in there and the mango Mango thats nice Oh yeah thats different Thats a game changer And then a banana one now I like the mango bite Mango is nice right Mango is really nice with it Hello this is Masarab Masarab thank you very much sir Masarab hello hello Thank you Do you have a straw Yeah I have Okay perfect I want to drink this Its too delicious not to drink this Mmhmm Mmhmm Now it is officially a milkshake A purple milkshake with coconut mango and bananas Enough messing around Did you spill anything No And I got a

behind us But Karon Karon its still very nice at Karon Karon but the actual sun is right there So would you like to go here for the actual sunset or Karon Karon So you have seen those spots already right Yeah So what do you think of the place over there It was nice It was really nice but I dont remember seeing the actual sun Well lets find out Okay Jump on the bikes Okay', 'so as you walk around the island youll see little rocky coves very beautiful of course theres a little bit of garbage in the island and they may love it and thats something I can be managed though if people just pack in

to help other people around them And theyre always giving you food always giving you food every halfs you go to Theres some sort of snack or fullon meal if they can They just they love to help other people Theyre so generous even though they have so little They because they have so little when they have they give what they have they give to other people And theyre just so concerned about you And theyre so cute Theyre so shy They are terrified to speak English and mess up But they theyre so friendly especially to Americans They love Americans They love the white skin the different hair colors Theyre fascinated by freckles I dont know how much now like because Americans have been there for a while but theyre just theyre so cute and friendly They love them Theyre so amazing And definitely like one of the best parts of the mission is getting to know the people and the culture there and really embracing the culture thats there Because I feel like sometimes its easy to just want to like no I have my culture you have yours and try to keep yourself separate But I personally loved that my trainer was like no you need to really try to adapt to our culture and like try to take on our culture And I think that helps me a lot because I understood my investigators at a deeper level and I was able to help them more because I was willing to really understand and live the way that they lived', 'But I love Filipinos They are so funny They have this really funny sassy sense of humor that it takes a little bit to understand and to find that their jokes are funny But after you start to understand it they are hilarious and theyll make you laugh And they love making people laugh So its great The culture is great The Filipinos are the best I think in the world They have because their third world country theyre very humble and very nice And because theyre also humble and they live in such humble circumstances theyre willing to share the world with you And even though the world may not seem like a lot to somebody coming from out of their country its a lot to them One of the cultural things is Filipinos will never eat the last thing on the plate Like if you have some food out theyll never eat the last rice Theyll always leave it for somebody else because theyre caring and theyre thinking of others Same thing if you come into their home and you look thirsty even if they dont have juice or something theyll go out and buy some juice with whatever they have and share it with you Theyre the nicest people Theyre an Asian country so of course they have a lot of respect for their elders And Ive got a lot of that Asian culture but theyre also third world so theyre very very humble and very respectful and all they do Theyre just the nicest people ever', 'The culture is

very humble and very respectful and all they do Theyre just the nicest people ever You dont really get your door slammed in your face ever because theyre so nice You will have people turn you down and especially in the city it gets a little bit more people are a little bit more busy so theyre a little bit more edgy and theyre a little bit more harder to get into the home But with Filipinos you almost always get a first appointment Like when you knock doors you almost always be able to walk in their door The problem is this is the second and third time They are so concerned about your feelings and how you feel They dont want to turn you down so theyll either just hide or avoid you and try to like not make contact rather than tell you up front like hey were not interested in the gospel right now Theyll just be like oh you know thats cool but I got to go to my grandmas or whatever and theyll make excuses and theyll be very polite so sometimes you have to kind of feel that out and kind of feel where they are and just kind of understand where theyre coming from because theyre theyre too nice to say no basically theyre just really happy That can be a really good thing for missionary work because sometimes like theyre just so easy going that when you set appointments you can go and you can have those appointments in their great but sometimes that becomes a bad thing because then they commit like if you ask them like oh will you read the book of warman theyll be like yes of course Ill read the book of warman youre the best dont read everything and then you come back the next day and theyre like so did you read and theyre like oh I totally didnt and theyre just committing basically to help please you and to help you feel better about yourself not because theyre actually committed to doing anything which is very nice and very polite but also kind of makes it a little bit harder to read them and understand where theyre coming from and theyre pointing at you so its theyre really nice really good people but sometimes you just got to work with them and kind of beef just straight and be like hey look we dont like your person you have feelings how do you feel about this and theyll be honest']"

bitterness from the char From being grilled From where that sugar has caramelized Oh my goodness Look at that Super super tender I actually think this is pork This is not beef These are pork steers Oh

try it but Im scared at the same time So this is blood sausage stew I was you guys I know a lot of you ask for crispy pata but loot and all kinds of other dishes Unfortunately right now do certain circumstances with everything going on in the world You guys have to realize a lot of options or dishes and a lot of small you know family own restaurants are going to be a little more limited And the crispy pata and those type of things are a little bit harder to come by right now But rest assured I will make another video in the future with all the other dishes I have yet to try But I thought it would spice it up and be a little adventurous today trying something that Ive never had before Morecia Morecia Oh mom said this is called morecia and Spanish This is blood sausage Now camera it looks brown You guys are promising its black in person All right Very yummy Hey What What Oh my God Oh my God My mouth is salivating so much What Oh my gosh Hold on Whatever that meat is is super tender The

'dating foreigner', 'filipino woman']","['So as what they say we are entitled to our own opinion However if that opinion becomes a judgment to others thats when it becomes a problem Most Filipinas have a fear of being judged particularly with other Filipinas Now if youre dating a foreigner here in the Philippines some people would think that you are dating him because of his money Since most of not all Filipinos have this perception that if you are a foreigner then youre rich If youre white then youre rich Most Filipinas dont want to be thrown with statements like only desperate Filipinas are dating foreigners Youre only dating a foreigner because you need a visa Youre only dating a foreigner because you want to get out of poverty Youre only dating a foreigner because you want a western passport Youre only dating a foreigner because you want financial security Youre only dating a foreigner because you want his money Youre only dating a foreigner because you want a baby with blue eyes Now these are the most common statements that Filipinos will throw at you if youre dating a foreigner here in the Philippines Especially if youre a younger Filipina with an older boyfriend Some people here will really look at you from head to toe while judging you in their minds Its sad but thats the reality Lets take for example when you were able to build a house When you were able to buy a car or when you have a nice bag or when youre wearing something expensive or when you go eat and offense your restaurant and you have a foreigner boyfriend or you have a foreigner husband People here will judge you Theyre gonna say ah you were just able to achieve all that because of your foreigner because of your foreigner husband because of your foreigner boyfriend There are only a few Filipinas that can really take all of these judgments', 'Okay so now that these are established what are the signs that you need to stop pursuing a girl you like immediately Okay listen some men find it hard to distinguish between a Filipino whos not interested in a Filipino whos playing hard to get She may or may not like you but youll never know unless you really open your eyes Look out for this following signs and stop pursuing your Filipino immediately When she replies to text DMs and emails with closed answers let me break this down for a moment Dont mistake this for the popular passiveaggressive letter K that she sends you when you send her something I mean the girl doesnt even respect you enough to write a full okay at this point Please note that shes merely entertaining you and things are really not how you think they are If a girl is not interested shell do everything she can to stop the conversation in its tracks Dont entertain that Number two when shes always busy respecting a persons priorities is important especially if youre not in a relationship with them If a girl has a lot going on in her life she may not be ready to date However a woman who is genuinely interested in you will likely make an effort to adjust her schedule to fit you in whether its for brunch dinner or any other activity you have planned Number three she agrees to date but cancels last minute You may begin to notice that something always seems to come up right before your scheduled date What is understandable if the woman has genuinely scheduled in conflicts If this has happened multiple times its time to take a hint She may not be interested in you so its best to stop pursuing her Number four shes always on the When are you getting When youre together Now in this day and age of smart phones people are almost always glued to their phones but this shouldnt be the case when youre on a date If you notice that the person youre with is more interested in their phone than in spending time with you its a clear sign that they care more about whats happening on their phone than being present in a moment with you Unless you can take photos of her and post them on social media or live to your date youre pretty much used to this to her at that point in time Ive seen this in our year too many times in restaurants around BGC and mostly they are older men dating young Filipino women If shes showing this sign stop pursuing her Even if shes young and has the greatest beginning body dont let yourself get her Number five she never picks up your call when you call first Look you can come up with all the excuses in the book when a woman never answers your call Its simply because theres someone else who has her attention Its either that or shes up to something she doesnt want you to know about How come she never answers your call in the first attempt Mind you in the previous points we talked about how shes always on her phone when shes with you If you cant put on her phone when shes with you when shes home and alone shes most likely have her phone calls by or with her So not answering your calls when you call is a downright shady move If youre not lucky she wont even return your calls for days at a time Which brings us to the next point Number six if the girl youre dating has access to technology its unlikely that shes unable to receive or read your messages for a day or longer Its more likely that shes choosing not to reply or engage in a conversation Dont make excuses for her behavior If she is active on social media and technology savvy she should have time to respond to you That is if shes interested only if shes interested When you begin to know these designs its best to stop pursuing her right away Number seven shes feeding you left overs and I dont expect you to take this pointer literally If shes entertaining you just enough to keep you interested but will not commit to anything meaningful over a period of time Ill tell you straight this girls up to no good Women have a way of giving men just enough to keep men coming back by giving them scraps of attention You manage just to keep you hanging on because shes probably keeping you as a backup until she finds the one You know when someone breadcrumps another person they give them just enough attention to make them think they like them but thats all Its just crumbs Dont entertain it Youre being used as this point Number eight she sounds uninterested So indifference is a telltale sign of lack of interest that is easily recognizable You can usually tell when someone is unenthusiastic by their glassy eyes monotone voice and general appearance of boredom when you talk on the phone or in person These are definite signs that shes not interested If shes showing these signs shes probably not rejecting you because she thinks its too much work It might be best give this Filipina a break and move on Number nine she never initiates anything Now maybe it may not be apparent to you initially because your feelings of love or lust are clouding your judgment but over time you may begin to realize that she never initiates contact with you such as texts calls or making plans to see each other This realization may leave you feeling that if you dont reach out first you may never hear from her again Number ten she blows hot and cold This situation can be confusing because sometimes she appears to be very interested in you but other times she seems this interested Its possible that she enjoys attention from you when shes showing interest but when shes distant she may be receiving attention from other men as well Number eleven she always has to check her schedule Now if you ask her to hang out or go on an official date and she frequently responds with a line Ill check my schedule and see But then conveniently forgets to let you know thats a sign you should take the hand She may not be interested in using this as an excuse to avoid turning you down directly Number twelve she avoids physical touch Now if youre sitting on a couch or walking alongside each other and she makes sure that she keeps a distance between you two I mean she doesnt initiate hugs or any other physical touch She doesnt like it at much okay Even if lets say Filipinas are traditional and they dont like public display of affection thats true But if she really likes you shes not going to constantly keep the distance from you Number thirteen she prefers to see you in groups She might have actually said yes to hanging out with you or to a date but she always wants to bring friends along or she invites you anywhere that you can be sure there will be groups there She does this because shes trying to avoid hanging out with you oneonone', 'Women on Filipino cupid certainly arent getting

divided opinion on what a Filipino truly looks like To some Philippines is the diverse race highlighting the ethnic diversity of the Philippines with naturally kaya mongi Filipinos beautifully darker in agredos lighter skin groups such as the mestizas and Filipino Chinese and many more groups with distinct features that encompass a single race To other kababians of ours being Filipinos defined by having big doublelidden eyes brown kaya mongi skin and notice which are labeled as po which isnt really something to be ashamed of In fact its often heard in the number of Filipino songs Media and even books for school kids tackling the Filipino identity which all equate to the idea of a homogenous physical appearance of Filipinos However if we were to say that the Philippines is a truly diverse country such as the United States Brazil or Singapore we must then question why the term FilipinoPilipino which is roughly translated to very Filipino exists to describe the appearance of your average one If we look into this map by the Harvard Institute for Economic Research created in we can see that the Philippines apparently isnt as diverse as our neighbors such as Indonesia Thailand and Malaysia to name a few But we also arent as ethnically homogenous as Japan or South Korea which are the most homogenous in Harvard study If we were to look at the closest census of the Philippines at that time an overwhelming majority of of the Philippine population in the year were of ethnic Filipinos a term that was used to describe the ethnolinguistic groups descending from AustrianAsianspeaking migrants such as the Tagalogs Cebuanos Lumads and the like The most significant foreign ethnic minority at that time were the Chinese Filipinos followed by the mixedestesos However its important to remember that ethnicity like race is a social construct which simply means that it was made by people to supposedly make sense of things we find difficult to understand So next time a foreigner says that a Filipino celebrity or even people like you and me either dont look Filipino or look very Filipino remember that a Filipino can look like this This this and a majority of us still look like this But in the end were all simply beautifully and wonderfully Filipino', 'Hello my name is Ariel Im from Singapore So growing up in Singapore Im interacted with a lot of multicultural people So a lot of people from various parts in Southeast Asia Ive obviously met a lot of Filipino people So a lot of them to me I can easily distinguish whether from I can kind of distinguish if someone is Filipino someones from Cambodia or Laos or Indonesia But in general there are some traits that I would say are quite telling if a persons Filipino Firstly in my opinion I think Filipino people have very dark hair So they have very dark eyebrows very dark typically black or dark brown And they also have very thick eyebrows and thick hair So thats one of the physical traits that I use to distinguish The second thing is that obviously because when Southeast Asia a lot of people are quite tan And a lot of Filipino people Ive met are quite tan as well They also have more distinct features that I would generally pinpoint as Filipino physical traits So a lot of Filipino people that Ive met have a rounder kind of heart shape face where its rounder to top and point here at the bottom So they have very sharp chins and very round faces A lot of Filipino people also kind of have rounder noses like more button noses less of a high nose bridge but more button noses But I think one of the most telling signs is obviously all Asian but they have quite Eurocentric features So typically when I see an Asian person but also they dont look completely Asian I would kind of second yes And a lot of them that Ive encountered happen to be built you know', 'Ill actually go from the panel The Filipinos as a people its just like its not diverse Maybe its just people like lack of knowledge but for me Filipinos in other countries around Philippines they have common features People from there it is similar to the Filipinos My name is Ran What contrasts in Thai In terms of energy In my life in the UAE Ive met a lot of Filipinos In my opinion Filipinos have a lot of common in general either in their face features their skin tones even in their morals Theyre interconnected people Like really if you find a Filipino have a darker skin tone or a brighter skin tone they all have the same skin tone in my opinion Also for their eye shape their nose mostly they look alike Sometimes I have hard time differentiating between a Filipino and an Indonesian but they look really alike But in general in my opinion I find Filipinos have a lot of common Even in their morals theyre so friendly and kind Its a rare thing to find a Filipino fronting in your face or not trying to help you']"

doesnt happen George I use my own towel but you get confused but youre not you can Im really George you know earlier we were saying about how George is forgetful he forgets where hes put his own towel he forgets which towel is his where hes the trait of being very forgetful Ive George its not you know and that is why George thinks Ive used his towel but its not Im his my own towel here we guys we have come out thats all wrong dont listen to that weve come out now to an area Ill think about third one there is one before getting accused of lying and weve come back to an area now I really really like you know around the festive walk area its kind of like I dont know it feels like a bit more modern theres big lights and stuff loads of restaurants theres a restaurant over there that we might try out the sea being called farm to table so Im guessing they do like me I may maybe state or something I kind of wanted to find a guitar shop because Im doing a bit of research for the music channel guys so Im starting so George is thinking he wants to start doing covers or like maybe some of his own songs he writes on the swell okay pepper and yeah what did you do anyway we were joking around its a full video genuinely is it something youd like to be in it maybe let me know let me know I mean this probably wouldnt happen until we kind of it would be a lot easier to do this if we have a base here so then I could set up like a studio room and get some nice recording equipment and buy some new guitars and stuff like that so it was kind of like a random thought and I would just do it for fun just as a hobby um whoever wants to watch can watch you just more be for me to be honest so having a little wander around now if theres a guitar shop here I would check it out but look at this this is this is so nice here it looks like theyve got almost like Christmas lights up you went in this one of these restaurants Ill pretend again wait will we probably in pain no I shouldnt have been coming oh no I had the big feathers in the headband and stuff and I was covered in stuff yeah um we went into the restaurant up here after that uh met loads of your guys here as well I havent loved that yeah look look at this its nice the other side of the road here on the festive walk weve got this whole street here and theres more cafes restaurants coffee shop lets go on and this looks nice

vampire In life she was a caring mother and wife who wanted to give the best life to her family One day she signed up as an overseas Filipino worker and moved to Canada to care for sick people One of the patients there was dying from an unknown disease later on before his dying breath the patient went in and bit Maria passing on his vampiric powers to her She accepted the power without knowing the price that she would have to pay Maria returned to the Philippines where her hunger for human blood began to grow She could contain it no longer and eventually killed and cooked her own two sons After that Thats terrifying That stuff actually bothers me Like it Like not necessarily the cooking and all that kind of stuff but the whole fact that there are crazy people out here in the world that do kill their children and then Thank you for clearing the air that you dont like dead children No no its not that Its just I got two kids And when something comes out in the news about somebody killing their kids Its sick Its super depressing It really affects me I deal with anxiety And when I see my kids I cant just stop hugging and loving on them Because I I know its They got to know that Theres people here I want them to know that I love them more than life itself Right Yeah no its crazy how She became an asswang A Filipino folklore creature that feasts on humans Her husband returned home to find what she had done and flew into a rage He attacked her and slashed her face with a bowler knife She managed to escape though and now locals say that if you ever see her lurking in the shadows youll know its her from the huge scar across her face And then its up to you to start running Nothing like a nice gory one to end it on but shall So she let her husband live Yeah I suppose Well it

in Tresse is very cool Oh okay so thats the white lady Thats the ghost right The ghost that was represented in the first episode of Tresse right I think thats who that is So I hear this white lady only attacks men that drives caps Taxi taxi caps It sounds stupid Huh I dont know if they mentioned mermaids in the video that I watched of Filipino mythical creatures These creatures remind me of Greek mermaids you know in the story of how do you call him in English I know him in French you know or Ulysses or something in English where you know theyre on the boat and mermaids get around the boat and start singing in their beautiful voice And so Ulysses and his men get completely drawn by these mermaids and they almost got killed by them You know like their ship I think was going to be was going to sink because of the mermaids Im not sure you know like this is very hazy I used to follow Greek mythology when I was a kid but its been a while So I dont remember it correctly But yeah all Im trying to say is that these mermaids remind me of the Greek mermaids Oh nice I have to listen to this one again By day Im an ordinary gal By night Manana gal Manana gal is really scary man Oh burning right Wow he went all out huh I really appreciate his dedication Hey Hey Hey Oh okay So he made this rap song around the time when Pacquiao was about to fight Floyd Maywe What happened to my bee No dont worry The characters in this video are mythical and are not true Mabuhai Except for the dwindee they are real Go Pacquiao Wait wait wait wait wait wait he forgot about the ticbalang right Isnt the ticbalang that baby Thats scary baby that ugly baby I think thats what it is He didnt show the ticbalang I think the ticbalang is very important man Its so creepy The ticbalang Wait ticbalang', 'But this is now were just going to wrap it on a list of fun cultural facts for the Philippines Filipinos have a ton of superstitions For example Whistling at Night will turn you to a werewolf For formal occasions you may see Filipinos wearing traditional barons for men and Maria Clatta or Mistees addresses for women There are many other traditional costumes and customs for the other ethnic groups Too many to cover but it goes everywhere From feathers coconut fibers hair dresses tribal tattoos and so on Its being a witch Filipinos dominates major international beauty pageants with a grand total of victories at the Miss Universe Miss World Miss International and Miss Earth competitions Basketball and boxing are the most popular sport by far They have the oldest basketball league in Asia and the second oldest in the world after the United States And come on we all know Pacquiao The Philippines is the leading nation to train and export nurses abroad Its been said at one point every Filipino has their Should I just drop everything and become a nurse moment in their life crisis Thats a fact Ive had those And the word Balik Bayan means returner or returning family It is used when someone comes back from an expat worker abroad You might hear the honorific title of Paul or Opal Bambam and Merl Every Filipino on every island in every region can tell you Filipinos are obsessed with karaoke The first karaoke machine was actually patented by a Filipino Roberto del Rosario even though some Japanese do it So that was pretty cool He patented it on the same Yeah like the way Balik Bayan is Besides taking modern cues from American pop they also have traditional style Insurance include things like Guadalajapi Gilitang Guimbal Gubin and Togali In addition there are many different styles of dance But the most famous one considered the national dance is Tinikling A dance done between two pairs of particular bamboo poles that are clapped together as percussion tools And the dancers must bring their feet in and out in the spaces before they get more tripped Yeah lets do more Objective note we do have to talk about some of the controversy Cutting The Philippines is beautiful but if you were picking up with current events they could have actually created issues that made headlines We dont sure if you could quote that Cutting Human trafficking whether in the sex industries slavery or organ smuggling has been a problem in certain areas And even though antitrafficking acts have been passed by the government enforcement has not always been on par The drug trade has also been a major inconvenience for decades affecting millions of people in the country This has led to the new controversial laws instituted by President Duarte which encouraged the public to seek bounty in exchange for hunting down drug pushers many have died in the process And finally you have the Morole Conflict an insurgency in the predominantly MuslimMindinale region which sought to take parts of Eastern Malaysia and break away through conflict The fight has been going on for nearly half a century and now its just ending at the turn of the st century Kind of For what is worth though in the Philippines everyone is family at the end You dont have to be related to anyone to call someone atte or kuyya Theres even a word by a nihan which means something like helping one another through community spirit without expecting anything to return In any case weve got to finish off the segment with history Austronesians tribal kingdoms and saltinets This guy came to the islands Catholicism comes in Lappu Lappu and Magellan dies in battle So fast history So fast history Weve finally become a colony of Spain The Galiant trade British Philippines And then

is experiencing a massive innovation The chart does absolutely not like its funny because theres no reference to like what these stand for And its just theyve sprung up They have them color coordinated to the countries and stuff Yeah but it has no relevance to what hes saying at all I think its hilarious Im up in the last few years The region is experiencing a massive innovation boom from super apps block chain enabled games and revolutionary financial services In the midst of all these where does the Philippines stand in the age of digital startups Well currently what we first must know is that the country has indeed experienced massive growth in its startup ecosystem in According to Core C in just the first months of Philippines startups have raised well over million dollars during an antithetical trip from This comes from as the Philippines ended as the fastest growing internet economy To be fair it makes more sense to do it during a Right but to be able to maintain and continue to grow A lot of companies obviously died Right but I feel like theyre talking about tech type stuff like apps and stuff that are going to boom during Yeah and he did just say its fastest growing internet economy of Southeast Asia Yeah so that makes sense to me Yeah and you guys are on your phones a lot so Exactly very useful So its even more Yeah so Anami in all of Southeast Asia posting a gain of well over from Wow As tech startups leading the way into the year they have taken the opportunity and pursued a brighter future for the country These have led to digital businesses landing on Forbes Asias to Watch List These are famously known as Chat Genie a multichannel commerce platform Cloud Eats an advanced Ghost Kitchen Food Delivery service platform Keleber a platform for job seekers or companies looking for talent And Paymango the FinTech startup used by thousands of businesses and partners with global payment services There are now a wide array of businesses in the country with firms reporting over organizations operating receiving million dollar funding Whats driving this growth for hunger in the tech industry is what was brought in during both the lockdown and the rise of entrepreneurial ship in the country The COVID pandemic has brought in a sore in massive necessity and interest for the digital world The Internet economy which had doubled from to is even still expected to grow fold by at an estimated value of over billion dollars A report done by Google stated that digital merchants or small and medium enterprise sellers have become one of the most tech savvy people in the country using a wide array of digital services from payments insurances marketing and so much more This drove tech startups like the ones mentioned above into creating services and products that would then cater to both these digital merchants and consumers Furthermore previous initiatives brought by the government have also pushed this agenda of going digital forward These are the likes of the Philippines Innovation Act which aims to fast track development in startups by providing them funding', 'How big a countrys foreign reserves are One that is often misunderstood and missed out on when said since talk about it This is also a big part of why the Philippines is not at risk for territories when it comes to foreign debt People say that the country owes too much money to foreign lenders such as China and China even at times Japan Yet they forget that the country also means foreign reserves adequately enough compared to its foreign debts But to truly understand how important the Philippines foreign reserves are you must first take a look at the first key data point According to the World Banks data which shows what is known as the total reserves in months of imports meaning how much reserves a country has relative to its imports shows that the Philippines has the highest in all of Southeast Asias regions As of the data the Philippines has about months of total reserves in months of imports Thailand for instance has only about months of total reserves in months of imports whereas even via Are we winning Were winning Were winning for months This is also a nice data point that showcases how much the Philippines can absorb in the case of a downturn For instance we have seen several commodity shocks in recent months where oil and gas had seen prices skyrocket This has caused a strain on Philippine importation but it was adequately met due to considerable foreign reserves Furthermore imports aside another key aspect that shows how robust the countrys foreign reserves are is due to external debt The data set of the World Bank which calculates the total reserves as a percentage of external debt is the second factor here Because foreign reserves are also what is being used to pay the external debt You borrow in US dollars you pay in US dollars The risks here are likely disastrous Foreign debt has crumbled several economies globally The Philippines crisis in the early s was even a historical case related to its foreign debt Therefore the need to have larger foreign reserves over its external debt is necessary As of the Philippines has about of total reserves as a percentage of external debt higher than both Vietnam and Indonesia and only behind Thailand This is an important factor in understanding that the Philippines is actually in a better position when it comes to adequacy in foreign reserves It is also worth noting that foreign reserves play a crucial factor in a country The larger it is especially compared to its foreign debts and imports may suggest that the country can be more stable There were more than several cases in history other than the s of the Philippines crisis that caused a downturn of events when it comes to foreign reserves One very big example is the Asian financial crisis where economies from both regional blocks of Southeast and East Asia sought tremendous capital outflows This wrecked governments two private corporations declaring bankruptcies and financial institutions because their foreign reserves had gone empty This led to the likes of the international monetary fund', 'Many nations around the world In some cases however there are also some nations that have taken on too much debt yet survived an economic catastrophe such as Japan But these special cases may not always be implied in every country that would face such a disaster Do take note however that while debt is often known for being a notorious instrument it is still an actually the single best reason why the modern world has developed to where it is today Because it allowed many countries to invest in infrastructures businesses and so on Finally one of the factors that needs to be fixed is the countrys tax revenue which is not generating enough The tax revenue to GDP ratio is a basis to see if a country is generating enough taxes from its population The Philippines in has received just percent which is a figure far lower compared to the rest of the world Its Southeast Asian counterparts such as Vietnam standard at tax revenue to GDP of percent Interesting Thailand at percent and the best development nations from Europe are upwards of about percent That was not a way The Philippines is very much lagging in its tax revenues Theyre actually higher than Malaysia Indonesia and Singapore in the region This might however be due to Malaysians Singapores having lesser tax implementations in them Whereas Malaysia does not even have its own value added tax and Singapore with very low taxes Wow Further there are also many countries with special circumstances Oil rich countries do not need to rely on tax revenues as they gather enough money from their exports This however does not seem to apply to the Philippines Hence it must turn to improve its tax revenues This is done by closing down loopholes for tax evasion While a controversial topic it has been found to be a big issue in numerous ways throughout the archipelago nation But it could also be through as we have mentioned increasing productivity and improving businesses and national infrastructures Finally government revenues and expenses are also steadily growing every year This is a result of the economic growth it experiences More tax revenues and more need to service its country By the end of total revenues are slated to be trillion pesos or billion dollars much the same as last year But taxes and spending are just projections and are not always right But even after generating this amount of money government revenues are still far short of how much they got in Where did it receive trillion pesos which may imply that the country is still trying to catch up from the COVID economic crisis in More over the next few years The government is still not generating enough money Its budget for in the coming years is going to rise higher If the government revenues do not pick up it would force the government to raise money via loans But anyway these are just some opinions and do not dictate how the economy of the Philippines should work But do let us know what you think Thanks for watching']"

of school and go to college Our budget will need to be looked at And it may change Maybe less maybe more Maybe the same Well have to see Obviously with a budget you cant stick to it forever We didnt set a budget for the next years of our lives You have to review it every year You have to go back on what you spent Yeah And see the areas where you can save money Thats what were doing right now When costs go up you need to make sacrifices You need to make changes Either that or you need to find a way to increase your budget Which we can do So as your budget can change you also do need to have savings if possible If youre under budget one month dont just spend it Save it for the next month If youre under the year if your budget even is out thats great If you have money left over even better They call it saving for a rainy day in the UK What that means is basically you dont literally save them for a rainy day Theyre saying that when things are good save money for when things are bad when times are bad As when your healths good youre not spending any money when its bad You might spend a lot of money So save what you can So the moneys there if and when you need it when times want so good So thats what we have involved in to our budget Not a month by month by budget So year by year we have which is around And thats what we stick to Some months we go over some months we go under But it has to even vary even with the cost of living and inflation going up Its okay Our petrol has gone up as weve changed our car Weve got a more practical car now for what we need But its not as economical And I said a bit early we didnt have a car at the moment We will cover this in another vlog As this is something we feel is probably very important for foreigners especially moving here Why should you buy a secondhand car not a new car or can you trust a secondhand car in the Philippines', 'And now we are going to go over our bills and Ill make sure that all these numbers are from the screen to compare it to the average bills First bill is housing We built ahead of time and therefore our mortgage is zero so we dont have a rent and we dont have a mortgage Second one electric bill Oh Second bill is electricity where averaging a month So a little over peso with the exchange rate right now but we have solar because we bought solar and paid for it in advance so our electric bill should be is what were using for kilowatts but were only spending Now when net metering kicks in that number yeah January or February when net metering kicks in then our bill should actually be zero So then the first two bills that we have will be zero Third one is How do you say that Internet Yep exactly Internet Okay and we are averaging will we spend a month Fourth year fourth year when And we I dont know the programs but we have three options out here for Internet Yeah Yeah we got the fastest one I know that And two one eight and two four And two two Oh no two two we have Yeah there is three different Internet options out here because we do have fiber where we live So yes we are spending a month or peso but that is getting us the fastest Internet there is and its unlimited Your cell phone bill is bill Yep Whats its vibe Well were actually spending less than on our monthly cell phone Oh yeah because were using bank band We have unlimited load or not unlimited load We have unlimited expiration on our load and we put in on each one of our phone and that was like three months ago Food dash home Food dash home yes Food Food yeah Okay so we do zero shopping at a grocery store so I mean we go to Robinsons for nothing other than Splenda which is going to last forever pretty much but yeah I mean our food cost is averaging or its costing us about So one week itll look much higher because I will buy kilos of mangoes I will buy pineapples pounds of beef sorry kilos of mangoes kilos of peanuts and then Im chopping it all up and then its stored away in the freezer and we have quite a bit of food So we have been here since weve been here were averaging Were averaging a month to eat at home Food out Yeah Food out food in food dash out Yes no I like how youre saying that its very professional I like it I like how youre saying that How I say it Food dash out its funny Yeah I just read what you wrote Yeah no youre absolutely right Okay take out food or eating in restaurants Were spending an average of a month If anything were getting like an entire chicken and its costing us a little under or when we go to breakfast rice is peso and then its what peso per egg Yeah I mean Im spending you know or or you know I mean well usually spend total when were going out to places like that because again we live in the province we dont live in the city Theres no Dunkin Donuts Starbucks or McDonalds or any big name that youve heard of for at least an hour and a half So when were going out to eat its very very cheap for us Transportation transportation Transportation Transportation I like your accent better than mine so Transportation Okay were spending an average of a month and that average is over the course of months So when I say that one month it will be nothing because I had a full tank of gas and I drove once a week and I didnt move the province and its going to last me forever And then the next month well go back and forth to the city once or twice So its averaging out to about And Entertainment we put down a month or about pesos Heres the thing we wont use any entertainment for one or two or three months and then well be in the city and well go to the movies and then were going to spend more than So were averaging but most months we live in the province As far as entertainment theres no movie theaters or malls Yes you are as entertainment That bill I didnt put down here I need my other Oh thats free I have two other screens in the office That would need a bulk to go over that bill But anyways okay next one honey Water Water Water Water Water Water What No With a tea Water Water Water Water Yeah Okay never mind Okay you win Nope thats fine Were averaging or a little bit less We have a well and we have a holding tank so we can average However were also hooked up to the townline and with the pool and things like that or even gardening we end up using it sometimes just so were not dealing with the holding tank issue or anything like that but its so cheap Its you know like I said its Next one would be Visa Visa So for me only right now for the first year my visa is free So as a valedine coming into the country with a wonderful Filipina Oh yeah I have a oneyear visa free So I havent spent any money on that but again thats one thing that is going to be factored in later on because my visa will run out and then Ill be working on my citizenship or already am But anyways right now for the first ten months I have for visa fee MASS DENTAL and insurance Oh like they may see it Yes I like it too Okay so we put down to be safe I have one medication that I pick up which would be most of that Well see a dentist soon to get a cleaning Yeah I dont need but you need a food Excuse me I do not need Okay whoa Time out there Okay Im years old Ive never had a cavity in my life So yes Im going to go get a cleaning and get a checkup again but never had a cavity and I dont plan on having one Miscellaneous Miscellaneous So we are budgeting or not budgeting but were spending an average of a month of miscellaneous but this is the first year that weve been into the house so thats expected We do have a lot of oneoff purchases which is not included into our monthly budget because as far as building a house you have to buy a couch you have to buy a furniture So if you guys are interested in seeing a video on a final what it costs for the house we can do an updated video on that but buying a fridge or putting in a garden its not a monthly cost Were not going to budget every month to buy a new fridge Were not going to budget every month for extending the walkway for example or widening the garage or things that weve done the first year of moving into the house which we expected So that money is coming out of the house budget for the total house cost which were still way under so thats fine But either way right now or not right now for the last months our average is is our total monthly cost for a slip here in the Philippines', 'its cold now if it would be a win buying us its not cold theres no rain as you can see weve had loads of rain the last six days or so weve not been able to go and do anything at all so we thought wed make a video today we go for our budget its exactly six months anyway so were in a good position to do so to be able to do this we recorded everything wed spent kept a spreadsheet day by day week by week month by month we updated it we recorded it we adjusted our budget where we needed to but we were quite surprised with the results you might be too so were coming to the next one which is water now if you have a property you can have a water supply as here like the UK we have a water supply its a means fed water comes in off the street comes into our system and we have a responsibility for all the pipe work on our system you might not know that you have a responsibility for all the pipe work from the main road also as we found out as you do get leaks from time to time but weve bought a few confession joints so whats called coupling yeah coupling yeah we bought confession couplings and its a case of going out finding a leak splitting the pipe and fixing it its quite common when you live in the Philippines to have a leak the pipes are used theyre not buried and theyre not great quality to be honest they do split quite often and quite easily but batter our water so we allocated pesos a month is that too high its at the budget we thats what we said is a budget before we came before we came yeah that was too high yeah that was equivalent of around UK pounds now in the UK our water cost was around pounds a month so we fought with knocking half just under half pounds so weve actually spent on average a hundred and thirty pesos a month which is about two UK pounds so thats very reasonable very reasonable well under budget luckily this is just a means water drinking water will come on so thats in our food budget but weve very surprised with the water here weve got a great water pressure really high powerful when theres a leak now and then it never drops we dont use our water pump all the time only if there is like water leak like the water is slow yeah you know if it only if it ever drops really but it never drops and thats as a leak even with other houses here its never been low enough that its had to come on so anyone has been a outright leak its had to come on thats obviously affected our electricity from time to time over the six months but were in a position where we think were on top of it we can resolve it quite quick and quite easy because Ive got our hands dirty a little bit but the water here is very reasonable in cost I wouldnt say its clean you can drink it some people the local people drink it but because were not used to it so we have to buy our own water for drinking but you can drink it if you get a filter system in place which were going to look into doing it would save us a little bit of money along the way clean up the water']"

than I did in the States Alright without wasting time lets get into it So any experience thats lived in the Philippines can concur with me on this The reason we can live better in the Philippines and in the US is because of the low cost of living in the affordable loans For the same amount of money for the same amount of money youve spent in California New York Chicago in any of the major cities in the US We dont live in the area of those though They have luxury in the Philippines Before we move to the Philippines we lived in Chicago And as you know Chicago is not a cheap place to live So our monthly expenses would reach up to over per month A lot Congratulations you played yourself And thats not DJ tell us but thats a lot more than I think the average person would spend in the United States unless you did live in one of those cities New York sometimes are renting a onebedroom apartment Its just like absurd Like New York San Francisco LA those three cities in particular like known for having absurdly high prices for housing So well see Obviously if this guys rep in k a month hes gonna be able to get some good stuff Chicagos probably just a little bit below those cities and housing as well Its hard to spend it being how expensive the city is And nowadays especially with rising costs you would easily blow through that And also keep the mind that its an entire family as

problem with the age gap the extreme age gaps is conversation Really when Ive even dated women that were I dont know in their s and Im the conversation is a bit lacking Is the bedroom good Sure But how far does the bedroom take you if God willing I have another years on the planet And the conversation is basically nonexistent The woman is not a particularly perfect English speaker that has a lot of knowledge of a lot of subjects and yet shes kind of more looking at TikTok and kind of just concerned with what were eating that day And theres no intellectual theres no deep conversations about an array of different subjects People say oh you dont know what youre talking about who comes to girls for intellectual conversation Well I dont come to girls for intellectual conversation But the truth is after spending about a few weeks with a woman that doesnt have a lot of knowledge outside of the latest TikTok dance it gets a little bit dull Theres probably no reason to be hanging around each other at a certain point Now if you want sort of just someone for the bedroom by all means not just off out enjoy your last years the way you want to enjoy them And if youre compensating the woman financially and shes compensating you with some of the best years of her life I am not against it I totally understand it but know what it is And for me its always nice to have a partner that you can have those long conversations with because at a certain point in our lives were not going to be spending hours just doing bedroom activities You want to be able to discuss other things current events cryptocurrency the stock market pop culture whatever it is that floats your boat sports whatever A yearold woman in any country isnt really going to have extensive knowledge or a lot of intelligent back and forth banter and things of that nature when it comes to an actual relationship and a best friend and a partner for possibly the next years So if youre looking for sort of just a bedroom girl and youre okay kind of just feeling alone and just playing on your phone or maybe you got a buddy in town or something that you can talk to about those things by all means knock yourself out But if youre literally spending all your time with that one person or youre on a vacation or youre doing this even a year or something you will find yourself bored and you will find yourself feeling alone especially if the English isnt great This goes in any country I experienced This is my Thai exgirlfriend Their English is not that great and on top of that their intelligence and their conversation is just simply not there', 'Thats forward a little bit So this woman has a couple of boyfriend through high school and even in college And what happens is she gets hurt You know she gets brokenhearted You know it happens to the best of everybody She gets hurt She gets brokenhearted So all of a sudden you know she kind of puts that masculine mask back on again right Because a masculine person cant get hurt The masculine energy is strong right So we dont want to be hurt So they put that back on What hurts Oh man it does Then they see their friends getting married and doing this and doing that So then they say hey you know what I kind of want that family thing You know I dont need a man but I kind of want that family thing I want that husband I want whatever anybody else has on Facebook Okay So she then puts that feminine mask on again to attract that man and then eventually husband But meanwhile what the husband doesnt know is this She is writing a book and its not men are from Mars women are from Venus No no no no The title of her book is women are from Venus I know my man is from Mars but once were married it wont take long for me to make sure that he permanently relocates to Venus and never goes back To Mars To Mars Did you show me how this works Its pretty basic really You just put your arms through here and then your head through here and bring it up So once this man has been married for a while maybe they have kids maybe they dont Hes kind of been in Venus for a while right I didnt realize I had to tell you every time I want to take a dumb life So now these two people are married right After she wrote that book and then shes followed that book to a blueprint Like her mission was keep him in Venus Shes done a pretty darn good job of that right Make sure to call me right when you get to the hotel not like that conference in Phoenix Do wait two hours for you to call me Yeah I was the keynote speaker I was late to the podium Still Yeah youre totally right Im sorry Everybodys heard this term somewhere out there in the world Happy wife Happy life I think the same person that wrote the book I just talked about wrote that I do begin I miss you Because one day while residing in Venus because thats what makes his wife happy he just doesnt feel like himself So he says you know what I need to go back to Mars for a little bit You know its just maybe a day or maybe a week I just need I need to go back to Mars I need to be there But as he makes this suggestion to go back to Mars the wife at this time then says you know let me remind you of something I dont need you I want this marriage I want what we have but I dont need you If you think you need to go to Mars then you by all means go to Mars But let me tell you something When you come back there will be no sex Youll be sleeping on the couch Thats if Im even here when you get back So then the man has a choice to make Its like holy cow If I go to Mars Im going to lose everything that I love If I go to Mars but if I dont go to Mars Im going to lose myself Is he all there Like mentally I think so Its just an odd guy Its kind of weird I mean should we be worried No No No No Tracy didnt mention that We shouldnt let him gamble or drink too much Jesus hes like a remnant Its an obstruction to shit So this man is in a pickle You know he has to choose between two things If he goes to Mars hes going to lose everything he loves Everything hes known However if he doesnt go to Mars hes going to lose everything he is Hes going to lose his soul And a man with no soul My eyes will be dead', 'I mean I was just going to add that I think its important to just in general be confident about who you are and what you bring to the table just before you even date because I feel like the source of problems in a relationship come from insecurities and you know doubt right Which is stem from insecurities And I feel like if youre confident in yourself youre confident you know who you are and what you want right Im not saying that you know you should be picky or anything like that Like go out meet people go on dates get to know people really like you know understand them Dont just make you know first second judge Dont make judgments based off like snap judgments right But if youre in a relationship and you realize that you know youre putting in more effort and it just Theres a lot of red flags and stuff You can go ahead and you know decide and like oh it seems as though theres a lot of red flags here Im going to go move to a different country or a different different country Because Im assuming the flags are planted in the country of the person youre dating right Like you know Liz you know our country So like lets say Im a country you know I have a much of red flags planted on me You go you know what Im going to go to a different country It seems like theres a lot of red flags here Right I dont know if thats going to catch on But But like because I think right now were talking about relationships and stuff but like more so just dating No I feel like more people are justcopy like dating Its kind of hard to find someone whos actually looking for like a serious relationship And with dating apps being such like a big thing now theres one more tender I dont know whatever the fuck out there is Its kind of like weird when you act to meet someone whos like investing time and effort Effort is a big thing where you know you dont even see anymore And Hensers is like cultured I noticed when it comes to especially with like I cant speak much for like Filipinos because I dont I dont really They a lot of Filipinos not because I dont want to but just because like full Filipinos Because I dont know the situation never presented itself But Ive noticed with foreigners though theres like this I dont know if you guys can agree Theres this thing where youre like oh theyre just foreigner How do we hear for too long Youre my very programmed that you know this is just like a hook up or a fling And whatever happens happens I think for you two though because you guys might have bumble right So how did you guys know that oh this is more than a hook up I mean I think I think that starts with me you know I hate to take the claim I hate to take the fame and all the glory here I wont go back Well discover that later But I mean I went into it like I was on Bumble I was on Bumble because I was bored and also lonely right Like everyone else who goes on dating apps right This is everyone okay Im not special here But I mean I always approach it with that like if Im gonna go and actually spend the time to go and swipe and meet people I dont wanna just be like wasting At least for me I didnt wanna spend time just looking for hookups and stuff I would go for people who I felt like oh I could actually see something more than that Now if I ended up being a hook up and didnt have anything else past that you know thats fate right I didnt look for that And I feel like generally speaking now at least from all the dudes Ive talked to all the dudes theyre looking for hookups Theyre not looking for relationships And thats why a lot of people cant find relationships Its not just the dudes that also girls right Some people go on the dating apps because theyre looking to satisfy their urges Theyre looking to satisfy their urges Theyre you know theyre horny All those reasons right And its easier right And its easier right Because theres other people on the other side who are looking at the same exact thing Its a transaction right You go hey Im horny Youre a horny You know lets meet up right They just send you up text You know this is according to my guy friends right And then that happens just like that right And so I think that a lot of the problem is that like dating apps have become synonymous with hookups Its not like theyre not synonymous with relationships Because I feel like if there was a different you know vision different you know whats the word Im looking for Different impression upon the dating apps I dont think thats the right word But it still gets a point across And then people would be finding more relationships Because people are still finding relationships Theyre still getting happy and stuff Some of them start from hookups right And some of them start from like bar get together and stuff But so people are still looking for them Its just that when people are on like an application and their whole you know gold areas for hookups youre going to end up with a lot of hookups Thats just sort of the nature of it right']"

spend', 'spending', 'pesos month', 'cost living', 'expenses']","['Now the biggest thing affecting rental prices here in the Philippines well theres two things two big things that are affecting rental prices The socalled pandemic of the last three years where millions of tourists went back to their home countries And because of travel restrictions tens of thousands hundreds of thousands of condo units hotel units resort units have been sitting vacant for these past much of these past three years Now were seeing a few more people here in Seaboo City weve got the big January weve got the big large Synologue Festival going on So theres quite a number of tourists who have come in from various countries America Korea various countries But not nearly as many as in the past before the socalled pandemic So there are still thousands perhaps tens of thousands of units sitting empty If youre looking to rent a condo apartment a house its all available The important thing to you is to understand your budget and to control your budget and to spend within your budget Because if you dont trust me youre going to find yourself youre going to find yourself in trouble financially Ive got over a thousand videos up Ive done a lot of videos of condominiums of subdivisions what do you get what do they cost what do they rent for what do they sell for And you can go through those videos and a lot of that was prepandemic So oftentimes the prices are lower lower than they were previously And there are motivated there are some motivated landlords who will negotiate there are some who will not negotiate who want the higher prices So its up to you to stick within your for you should be able to get a very nice studio condo or at least at the very least and average a good decent one bedroom condominium for instance There are cheaper units that you can find even in Seaboo City ask the locals that you wont find them online usually And if they are online theyll usually go very fast at the very low cost Anything below say pesos a month will probably get caught up pretty rapidly Generally what you need when you rent a condominium apartment theyll ask for one months rent the first months rent and two months security deposit Now thats not always the case but thats very common here So if you rent a place for or lets say pesos a month you would have to come up with three times out of mold pesos And this is a cash economy still so you would have to come up with that in pesos if youd have to go to the bank several times perhaps to get that amount Another cost related to your housing your rent is electric and water is usually not included in your rental price And my observation and experience is that if you use a fan a lot Ive got a couple of friends who use the fan and know where very little air conditioning And their electric may run pesos up to pesos You know two to if youre very frugal with your electric usage And Ive talked to people who are up around for electric for maybe a one bedroom two bedroom And I run into a guy who once had a one bedroom square meters less than square feet And he ran his he liked it cold and he ran his aircon constantly day and night and he had to bill about pesos Now while Im talking about rentals also theres another fee that you may incur and that is condofees Now generally my experience is condofees are usually but not always included in your rental price Its important that you understand that and get that clarified ahead of time Because condofees can run anywhere from a low of but theyre usually closer between and Its more common in the higher end units even up to pesos per square meter And that can add up to several thousand pesos extra also', 'Alright so like I said this is going to factor in three different things that will make a big impact on what someone is spending So that being said Im going to go over the average cost And Ive gathered that together from every YouTube video on people living in the Philippines Ive put them all into different spreadsheets I have pie charts and graph charts looking at it So I can see the averages the highs and the lows We compare it to what were spending So well keep that part brief because thats not what were spending So I dont necessarily really care Alright so first one is the housing Is the housing So that is averaging for foreigners in between and And I know someones going to jump in and say they spend You cant We know people that spend And they have a bed and they have a shared CR with other people So you can do it for much less than that But most foreigners are going to say they want to be in the three to range I definitely know people that are in the to range If theyre in IT Park or Makati then they have a nice condo with a pool and things like that So thats the average for that The average electric cost for foreigners is in between and Now again I know people that are spending or a month I also know people that are spending to a month So it varies a lot based upon how big your house is and how much you prepared in advance Internet thats averaging Yeah its averaging thats a get go Its averaging I know people that spend or But you could obviously spend more than that for example Telephone The average Im noticing is around Definitely plenty of people online that they spend in between and Some people spend or because theyre on it all the time or theyre texting or using the Internet on it We use the no expiry so its by gig so it depends how With our load yeah And were rarely using our Internet when we leave Yeah we only use that when we leave Its been I dont know two months now and then I still have gig in my data Yeah its been months since weve loaded our phones and we put on each Yeah Food home like oh yeah food Food slash home so she actually read it correctly But anyways food home were talking about your general grocery bill The average foreigner is spending in between and a month Plenty of guys said that the average is or can be I should say in the range and plenty of people for larger households whether buying everything at a chain grocery store and they have kids they are spending to a month Yeah it depends Me only want it to one slice food and rice of course Im okay with that but him he wants more meat of course I have two breakfasts for example and shell have one egg and a small piece of rice or one toast and an egg So its Coffee Food costs can vary a lot and I think we all know that So next one Theres a little peanut butter is moving Yeah theyre like a half a person for a third Thats how you can say okay well go to food ash out food Food ash out Whats that You dash No no youre right it is food ash out because Im referring to take out food and eating out at restaurants Okay Those numbers are averaging around a month but that is a huge variation When I say that I have a friend who doesnt spend a month because he never goes out to restaurants I know other people that spend a month because they eat out at breakfast lunch and dinner and they live in the city So thats going to vary a lot but is the average for what foreigners are spending Yeah you eat a lot Youre going to add a dash to everything or no No theres more transportation So car again Yeah tricycle So transportation again its going to vary all over to is the average range Again thats put together through all the YouTube videos and all the forms and all the people that talk to is to Now Ive talked to people that spend or people that spend because they walk or they take a tricycle once a week Whats that Doing the church Right I mean a lot of local Filipinos will get a tricycle once a week because theyre just going to church and they walk everywhere else I know foreigners over here that spend a month on transportation because they have a car payment which Im not going to get into whether I agree with that or not But either way thats going to make a huge difference in what a cost you to live over here Oh like it depends when you do make it Its not wise to get a car because its always traffic and its better to take a tricycle than you know wait for traffic and car to part Yeah its a surprise to be that foreigners buy a car living in the city I wouldnt want to deal with the parking and the accidents with the car When we go to the city we park it at a hotel and we dont touch it for days because well take a tricycle or walk over Yeah its always traffic and its all hard to find a parking lot Yeah its very small unlike US very wide So you have nothing to wear about parking and your car is safe too Yeah but again I mean the average is you know to Some people spend I wouldnt do that myself but anyways Next one Entertainment You said that pretty good Okay Entertainment Yes okay People are averaging to I think thats a little tricky to average because a lot of people are factoring that in with going out to dinner and things like that because for entertainment were not spending much But I mean if we lived in the city I guess it could be higher Water Water Yeah the average is to A lot of people are paying zero because they have a well Visa I was surprised but it varied all over the board depending on the type of visa people had But people were saying and the average was coming out in between and a month I think is very high in my opinion but some people were spending that and they were getting a visa every month I mean every days and they leave and they come back and things like that And meds then Oh dental and insurance Yeah abbreviations But you know meds dental and insurance the average for that is about Now a lot of people are going to be spending zero dollars because theyre just theyre not dealing with any of that So thats what Im seeing for an average And then we have Miscellaneous Miscellaneous Okay Miscellaneous Everyone is budgeting and averaging about and which is going to be all kinds of random oneoff items whether its a present or a gift or you need to buy something for yourself or a phone charger you know whatever You guys I think you guys know what I mean', 'What is the cost of living in the Philippines Were gonna be honest were gonna talk about some of the factors that are affecting the Philippines in particular Youve got inflation at a little over the last I read walking through a housing subdivision over on Macid on Macid on MacTan Island at the present time and were gonna get into some real specifics and kind of a worksheet type thing So first of all what is your budget How much money do you have How much money how much income do you have on a monthly basis Youre not gonna be spending dollars or euros or pounds or whatever currency of your home country here Youre gonna be spending Filipino pesos So were gonna break it down into pesos And that means the varying exchange rates with your currency and the Philippine peso is gonna be a big factor on how much money you have here When I came here in the exchange rate was pesos per US dollar It is fluctuated and Ive done videos where Ive showed in the graphs for a number of different currencies Its gone up as high as about pesos record amount pesos per US dollar Its hovered around pesos per US dollar for some time and anyway Im gonna use the figure of pesos to the US dollar and figure out the average The average retiree gets about US dollars a month in their social security pension And I know other countries have different figures So take your figure rate it down get a pad and paper rate it down And multiply your guaranteed monthly income by Its a safe number It might go below that or whatever your countrys currency is whatever the rate is So times US dollars is pesos that you would have to spend every month If youre only making around lets say US dollars thats pesos You have to spend each month and I definitely suggest you dont spend all that money every month that you put some of that into savings Again were doing a worksheet for your budget Now many of the experts say you shouldnt should only spend around of your income on housing on rent housing payments whatever And of course in reality with the price of the house is going up around the world many people spend as much as half of their income But anyway lets take that figure pesos or pesos Whatever your peso income is per month multiply it that times to give you a figure and this comes out to pesos And you need to understand your budget you need to understand your limitations with your budget and you need to stick with your budget']"

cute See what I mean Theyre like tiny tiny little lines Orange is lemon Do you know what I mean Im excited to try this Thats going on the top Im still dressing mine Innocently that flavour just hits The food weve had so far in the Philippines is really flavourful It packs upon Very heavily heavily seasoned food That only touched my lips And I got a full hit of flavour Im having mine Im well Im having hot sauce with a side of noodles because unfortunately I need to eat hot sauce with literally everything I have Hes got an addiction An actual full blown addiction to hot sauce So lets try with the hot sauce Wow This is so nice Its only noodles and vegetables but honestly it tastes incredibly good The flavour is really good The flavour Ive never tasted the flavour like this That calamansis squeezy on the top Beautiful touch', 'Smells like vegan the meats food isnt it The meats amazing Its kind of like a Vietnamese menu isnt it Cool I want to share something like that Its like a chocolate Should we go on a hot oil Should we go on a hot oil on each table Yeah Wow If you ever come to this island and you see these culture club brand this is Brands brand He specialises in fermented foods Brands not here today but its nice to see that hes actually managed to achieve his dream get something up and running Weve just ordered a Vietnamese black coffee which comes dripping like this one of these special units I remember the first time weve tried a Vietnamese coffee was actually in Thailand because we havent been to Vietnam yet Vietnam is a place that we havent yet made it to isnt it We have it So now a list of places to go Yeah I think I hope were there in the next couple of years I think You can get to Vietnam quite cheaply from the Philippines if you can give yourself to Minina or a Seaboo So we are thinking about it I think its made in Minina but it goes from Oh is it The story would like it Yes The story likes all travel She likes all travel doesnt she Wait until its getting nice It would probably be like China or Japan China or Japan yeah Or India I dont know Yeah lots of places to try My coffee is almost ready I think its almost all dripped through now The last time Ive drunk avian it means coffee was in Thailand but Traditionally you have condensed milk at the bottom so the coffee drips into sweet condensed milk You can actually get a vegan condensed milk now which we saw when we went to Val didnt we Maybe an oatmeal isnt it Its hard to find Yeah that would be nice I have seen it on the sardine Yeah You could order some in It would be online Yeah Thats a look up there Yeah all my waters dripped through now so its ready to drink So Oh no no its no hot and tastes hot Its too hot for you Not bad Yeah Not too hot but its a bit really small It tastes a bit like a tungsty chocolate The food has started to arrive one by one and you can also have what youve got there I am going to be eating a bun meat Is this your first bun meat ever Yes actually And these are some cut up spring rolls And the means are still salad Salam alright Hello hello nice Thats my one And another salad with some options in it No its dumplings Its a bit far Get you out of your blanket Its time to wake up now Lets see what it looks like Time to wake up Hows that look It looks Its So I just want to try it Yeah Yeah me too We ordered all of the vegan options on the menu Its what the father of dumplings looks like You get these condiments with it Very fresh Look at that Lovely greens And Sasha has an amazing looking bowl over here A salad bowl with some tofu I think that is a lemon rice tofu Let me see What was the other option You can have it with spring rolls or dumplings Okay Everything looks super fresh Crunchy I have bought myself a coconut ice cream A vegan coconut ice cream Its actually really well served Its in a plate on a plate And its got like a leaf plate on top of a plate And its got coconut grains on top of it Its made out of full full full coconut Thats so I feel quite good Coconut milk What Coconut milk Just coconut yes Amazing', 'Were only on number eight So lets get on with it Im surprised this one is down on the list this far because this is a staple Pant seat Chinese influence in Filipino noodles And Ive had Pant sit in so many different ways but its definitely good Its one of those things You dont want to eat too much of if youre like me and you like food too much If youre somebody who stays active and youre in really good shape and you got great metabolism and you can eat all kinds of food and not gain anyway go for it For me this is one of those dishes I eat very very sparingly because I like it so much that I could really go overboard with it And they say every region in the Philippines has its own take on the quintessential Filipino food called Pant seat As I said theres a lot of variations Theres a lot of styles Its very cool And if you plan to travel around the Philippines you can kind of map your trip and have Pant seat at these different places and its going to be a little bit of a different spin on it So very cool Im surprised this is that far down in number nine on authentic food questcoms list of Filipino foods that you cant miss Lets move on Number Kinna la Filipino Kavish Again if I put you the name let me know about it in the comments because theres another one I dont think Ive had Seafood plays an important role in Filipino dishes and Kinna la raw seafood appetizer Its a ubiquitous dish prepared in all corners of the country Kinna la can be described as the Filipino version of Kavish Process of marinating fish dates back thousands of years Kinna la a sour cooking described the oldest method in the Philippines So as Im reading this I think I did experience something similar It was like a pickled fish I had in Ilo Ilo It was pretty good But this Im going to show you this picture Youll see its kind of interesting with the red onions and looks like theres cucumber in there Um it looks interesting Id be giving it Id it looks interesting I dont think Ive had it this way Id be interested to take a little forkful and see what I thought of it Let me know in the comments if youve had it or you make it or if you like it love it hate it Its another one of those dishes that I dont have a lot of experience with But if theyre putting it at number it says like we cant miss these dishes So I will definitely try it at the first opportunity Lets move on Number another shocker another shocker that this is not further up on the list because everybody loves lumpia All right and I think everybody knows lumpia lumpia said known Filipino spring rolls And again theyre prepared all different ways but similar The one that youre seeing right now Ive never experienced this one this way It looks quite different from the ones that Ive had Um the ones we get most of the time are a little little mini spring roll looking things with pork inside Very yummy And the dipping sauce is like a ketchup sauce with something Im not sure what goes in it but very very very yummy It lumpia is one of the dishes uh early again and early introduction to Filipino cuisine I had never had it before Um it is wonderful Im sure youve had it If youve not Im Im interested whos not had it If youve not had lumpia believe that in the comments because I want to hear that you didnt have lumpia If you havent you definitely got to have it because its fantastic out of this world lumpia is Filipino version of spring rolls They are derived from Chinese spring rolls and are believed to have spread throughout South East Asia with Chinese immigrants And again Philippines awesome has so many influences Spanish Western American Chinese uh Japanese lumpia I cant say enough nice things about lumpia Again something that I cant eat a lot of and eat all the time But when the opportunity presents itself I never pass up on an opportunity to enjoy some lumpia I need this to do So lets get on with number number Longanisa Filipino sausage from Alaska Fan another one fantastic I love the Longanisa I mean I cant say enough good things about that Its delicious Its yummy Yeah you see in some photos over right now No Filipino breakfast is ever complete without Longanisa The countrys version of pork sausage Very good Again leaving the comments Had it didnt have it Love it Hate it Love to hear what you think']"

format you requested', 'Philippines OK is New Quarantine Protocols for Travelers from Green Yellow Countries October th So lets go down here and just take a look Unfortunately we will not apply to most of you but for some of you Philippines on Friday started implementation of shorter quarantine protocols for international travelers coming from countries classified as low risk and moderate risk for COVID And you know its interesting because Ive checked travel sites and each country has their own list And they have different ways of categorizing countries And of course if like Fiji is allowing I think Australia is going to be on their green list Well thats where a lot of their tourists come from So theyre going to target people What generally theres a large group of people that come from a particular country And you would think the Philippines would be looking at that also but it doesnt appear so as we get down into their list Fully vaccinated individuals from green low risk and yellow moderate risk nations and jurisdictions needs to undergo facility based quarantine until release of their negative RT PCR test results taken on the fifth day So they got to stay at least five days and then wait a day or two or three for the results They will then be required to undergo home quarantine until their tenth day The day their arrival will be considered the day of arrival will be considered their first day Meanwhile unvaccinated partially vaccinated or individuals whose vaccination status cannot be independently verified or confirmed as valid or authentic by local authorities Coming from green or yellow countries will undergo facility based quarantine until the release of the PCR taken on the seventh day After that they need to undergo home quarantine until their th day Four in nationals are required to secure their own prebucked to combination of at least six days for the full inoculated Four in nationals are required to secure their own prebucked to

vaccinated abroad', 'Like in our neighborhood we can go a few days without seeing a cop You know theyre not stationed everywhere Right Theyre not hugging the block Right But we have lived neighborhoods where maybe you see a memory few feet True true Lets go Lets talk about it What do you think about the school that we protected No Because I think that every city can be safe You know you cant go anywhere Theres a sense of security especially in areas where theres a lot of crime going on in the Philippines Theres areas that we actually have presence of police officers The visibility itself is required there so that no criminal elements will attempt to do bad things The bad things in the area I think Im a cop But I think that security guards are more important because theyre not allowed to go anywhere Theyre not allowed to go anywhere So theyre also allowed to go anywhere You know theyre not allowed to go anywhere Theyre not allowed to go anywhere Im sorry Because theyre not allowed to go anywhere Why would you tell that Why would you say that It was a simple yes or no question I would Okay so like with officers you think when you see one you know the root of them is to protect and serve and give justice to the community and things are going on And another thing is so they can show the level of it I think this is another thing To show the level of intimidation to criminals who may feel like they can come around these parks at night on the mornings or midday To do something that doesnt need to be done to hurt still or you know do something that dont need to be done But at the end of the day again like the youth that said and Im looking at them as youve you know Im saying uh already young men theyre saying that they dont feel comfortable when they see officers with guns Simply because again not just for the criminals but just for society to stay in order Its also a level of intimidation And some of them are hiding it and especially like here when you deal with someone who may not like your kind you know thats scary situation Like if I choke in front of you or something would you help me or would you just watch me choke How long would it take for you to hit the radio Yeah Hello Youre not just doing what youre doing Youre not doing what youre doing but youre responsible for what youre doing No no no no no Youre not doing what youre doing Its a lot of friends who are businessmen Mostly because as most of the time the criminals the target is most likely to be a target of businessmen Of course if youre a resource you can just do what you want So prevention or you can deterrent is number one gun Whats your name I dont have a name I dont have a name I dont have a name for the criminals Thats right And you know you have a time for the criminals because youre doing what youre doing I do own guns I sell fire arms I have a gun I have a gun You actually got to have one of the own the gun Hey I would nice but for the same old bro I would think so I would think so Look at the background if you havent noticed Yeah now I feel like those type of guns dont need to be out and about I mean I do understand hunters Yeah theres not a hunting gun though Thats not hunting it Theres not Thats artillery What they needed for Those carry many magazines But what do what do our average person need that for Extraappression They dont They dont I dont even think an average person would have one Aint it illegal to carry one Yeah Its supposed to be illegal to have one like that Im not business yall Since I was a young boy because my father was serving the military And the reason why Im doing this is because we have training for tactical You can play games in the law enforcement or security guards That is why we miss more So you said guns like that You didnt say those are used for hunting purposes But Im just thinking a lot Like if there was a gun hunting with an AR bro theyll bleed right there Theyre food Yeah It wouldnt be no more like the animal would even be standing At all There would be pieces everywhere Hunters usually take like one shot Thats since Im many I dont know what type of plan it was They trained me They just needed to get a good shot at the camp And there were times when I was a person of security For the people who were in the camp I was safe because I was a man I was a man I was a man I was a man I was a man So I was a man A man I was a man Because if youre a man you cant stay there You cant do anything You cant do anything And you cant control yourself You cant do anything You cant do anything You cant just leave the camp in the Philippines So I think You cant leave me alone You cant leave me alone Because you cant leave me alone You cant leave me alone So youre a man You cant leave me alone Thats why youre a man I dont know I cant leave you alone What do you think You can leave me alone You can You can Connection']"

what has been being black in the Philippines in Well its actually an amazing experience Because Ive been here for not quite long but just a little while Its an amazing experience Because youre able to experience Amir Youre able to have a lot of experience positive and negative Especially as a black person You encounter a lot of racism Actually when I arrived here when I my first thing I entered in the cheap I saw some people like Carvin their nose I already observed actually I already knew this was a subracism But through the years and time was going on time was going on No what No thats the first time Ive heard that The Carvin the nose Like this Like I saw the video the other day of a man sitting on the airplane And he didnt like that He was sitting next to a black person And he was just like like maybe your belly smell is shake but Im coconut And everything else I got on here What do you smell like I didnt know they do that Like they cover their nose out of like they make it something like we stand Maybe look Well not one thing like stank We smell like some of the best smell of people ever Gaze Oh this is you and youre not gonna rock We aint gonna do anything else I got on Yeah we do smell like you know the richness of the rich Yeah you feel me But it always gonna smell good So you cover your nose I dont know what youre covering your nose for Yeah actually I are But used to it You know but its a I can say that I got used to it and actually became so normal And its been great experience What are some zero type that Filipino have on black people and where do you think it comes from Yeah first of all is that the perception that a lot of Filipinos have towards the black people It is for the fact of them thinking that in Africa I mean start by Africa itself Some of them think that Africa is a country itself When in fact Africa is a continent on which contains countries And that is the first one When they talk about Africa and they say that Africa in general they cannot distinguish with from Angola with from Ghana with from Cameroon They do not have that distinguish as what we have Unlike just like us Angolas as well When we come to the Philippines we think that every bad that comes from Asian goes to Africa to Angola For us youre Chinese Thats how we see you And they also think that Africans are good with basket ball As long as Africa you got the hides They see as a basket ball They dont think about you being a football player anymore Second least them thinking about you being a basketball player When they see what they want to But the Philippines number one in basketball So it makes sense They probably are looking for recruiters Or they probably want to play one at one at one You know Thats probably why I dont think the football is like a hype thing for the Philippines So basketball makes sense to him Say that Yeah To your ball say it Dont dont dont dont dont dont call your attention And also yeah its one of those that you see here in the Philippines But some of the stereotypes that Filipino have on black people And where do you think it comes from Well they usually see black people I mean yeah of course from TV from America And they see many things like black people are normally strong I think many people when Filipino actually when they see me they think Im a black American and Im something like that And yeah they ask where I am where Im from They dont usually know my country but I take the time to educate them when I come from my country from Angola But usually they think that Im a black American Yeah But they are very friendly and they ask me a lot of questions Im pretty much open to answer their questions Do you think the perception Yeah I think its because of the relationship and history between the United States and the Philippines especially you know because of some African Americans in their history as well So I think maybe thats why']"

well prejudiced against Japanese well not to be extended that I hate them No not that way But I got this well as a result of world war second Because well I guess I was here too young to understand what happened during those times But I think that what my relatives and friends and the people who were witnessed to that unfaithful occasion well they just more than justified the fact and I think Its justified for me to feel the same way because I know that my people suffered very much under that rule You still is prejudiced against the Japanese as you work Well five years ago that prejudice of mine was well slightly fading away But when Japans Stabberly refused to pay reparations to us Well the prejudice began to brew again But now I found out from close contact with Ureko and other Japanese that Japanese and Freddy to Pay reparations yet because as Ureko said Some of them and most of them even have to suffer the cold in the classrooms because they cant afford to heat the schools

sounds just like a cockney accent with an England and And I hope Im not conceded on anything better I cant copy accent in England You know most English people would shudder a little bit from the here But she very frankly told me that shes shuddered when she heard my accent I got feedback for that too Why did she say she did Oh I think she imagined that she said she really had to forget my accent

And the Negro women have a sort of reputation For being so beautiful A little jealous of them I guess you just envy us colored people I think so Is there anything corresponding to that Well I think so

especially these high society mattress Well even if theyve got already wrinkles on their face They still want to bleach their skin Suppose you meet one right now And you say oh good morning And you

difference you see Shes about very light here But you look at the arms and everything And the lower part of the body But jeez its just the Very great difference Its collared here But its very light

and his fleet show up to Manila meanwhile back in the US people are like Wait werent we just supposed to invade Cuba What are we doing in the Philippines now And the US governments like because the Philippines is a perfect hub for commercial opportunities in Asia And we think that if we dont take it Japan or Germany might take it Which would clearly diminish our geostrophysics advantage in the Pacific No they didnt say that They said we want to liberate the people of the Philippines Liberate the people you liberate will witness the honorable and decent spirit literally what they always say So thats really what theyre saying about Venezuela Like this year theyre like Ah we got to go down and save all those starving people in Venezuela We got to overthrow that government It doesnt end its the same thing over and over Spanish see the US arrived to the Philippines and theyre like great Were done So the Spanish military commanders ask to meet with the US military commanders They meet in secret and spains like listen I know were losing But we really want to save some face here We dont want it to look like we lost to the Filipino revolutionaries And Im not kidding the Spanish commander literally said that he would quote be willing to surrender to white people But not to the Philippines The US commanders like okay theres an opportunity here We said we were here to liberate the Filipinos but we havent promised anything yet So we would much rather it looked like the US defeated Spain instead of Helped the Filipinos defeat Spain much better for our brand said the United States So together the United States and Spanish militaries organized a fake battle a fake battle in which the US would fight the Spanish in Manila and the Spanish would intentionally lose and the climax of this whole theatrical battle According to the plan was that at the end the US would storm towards the inner walled city of Manila The last stronghold of where the Spanish are oh and the key detail in this whole plan They would not let the Filipino fighters the ones that had been doing all the actual fighting against the Spanish Join them as they stormed towards the walled city to deal the final blows The Spanish Empire and this would mean that the Filipinos technically didnt gain their independence It was actually the US who conquered the Spanish and then the Spanish are like oh can you give us million dollars for our troubles And the US was like yes sure So now the US wins the war and they', 'Oh okay So this is where things really heat up Its now Spain loses the war obviously And the US now owns Puerto Rico Guam and they claim the Philippines The whole Philippines The whole Philippines But the whole Philippines who have been fighting for their freedom for years are like no no no no no You just walked in here on our rebellion and conspired with the Spanish to make it look like you were liberating us No this is our country We dont need another colonized Yeah that is And this is where things really heat up The Filipinos start fighting again for their independence in this time against the United States It is a pretty horrible bloody war one that I never learned about in school It includes massacres of men women and children by the United States and hundreds of thousands of civilian deaths But the US eventually won And they established a government in the Philippines Back in the US the appetite for expansion continued to go down and people sort of just forgot about the Philippines They forgot that there was a war there One newspaper summed it up by saying Americans didnt know if the Philippines were islands or canned fruit But the fact that the US went to war and now owned the Philippines in addition to Puerto Rico and Guam So this baked a very important question one that hadnt been asked before Which is is all of this land America Are these people Americans This was a huge question And the answer to that question affects how we see these territories still today Okay so a few years after these wars theres a guy in New York City whos importing oranges from one of these territories Puerto Rico And hes paying tariffs on these imports because you know thats what you do when youre importing oranges from another country Wait a minute another country This guy was like didnt we conquer Puerto Rico and Guam and the Philippines Isnt that America The constitution says that you cant put tariffs on stuff coming from other parts of the US Like New Jersey cant put tariffs on like avocados from California So he sued and his case and a bunch of others like it made it to the Supreme Court So now the Supreme Court must decide is this land where we just won a war Is this America Are these Americans If they are do they get all the same rights as other Americans Do they get to vote Do they get to participate in the US economy without tariffs Like any other state does And honestly this isnt a question about oranges and tariffs The real question at stake here is is America the land of the free where all are created equal Or are we an empire No different than any other empire that scoops up colonial possessions in war and rules the people who are usually black and brown as subjects not fully a part of the country That was the question that was at stake And in this series of cases in the early s the Supreme Court decided that America was the latter Is the latter They created a new category of land called unincorporated territories where the people dont have any representation in the democracy But where Congress could create laws on their own particularly laws dealing with revenue which would not be allowed by the Constitution for states within the Union So in great revenues So thats totally unconstitutional for other parts of our country In other words unincorporated territories are land we control and exploit for revenue but whose people dont get to vote and dont get the right to try to like their own Were ridiculous So yeah ridiculous So how long', 'Okay so this is where things really heat up Its now Spain loses the war obviously And the US now owns Puerto Rico Guam and they claim the Philippines But the local Filipinos who have been fighting for their freedom for years are like no no no no no You just walked in here on our rebellion and conspired with the Spanish to make it look like you were liberating us No this is our country We dont need another colonizer Oh they know They know about this is a staged That battle was staged Well this is troublesome The Philippines just get involved in the conspiracy between America and Spain right This is shameful right The Filipinos start fighting again for their independence in this time against the United States It is a pretty horrible bloody war one that I never learned about in school It includes massacres of men women and children by the United States and hundreds of thousands of civilian deaths The US eventually won and they established a government in the Philippines Back in the US the appetite for expansion continued to go down and people sort of just forgot about the Philippines They forgot that there was a war there One newspaper summed it up by saying Americans didnt know if the Philippines were islands or canned fruit The fact remained that the US went to war and now owned the Philippines in addition to Puerto Rico and Guam So this baked a very important question one that hadnt been asked before Which is is all of this land America Are these people Americans This was a huge question And the answer to that question affects how we see these territories still today Oh really Interesting Okay so a few years after these wars theres a guy in New York City whos importing oranges from one of these territories Puerto Rico And hes paying tariffs on these imports because you know thats what you do when youre importing oranges from another country Wait a minute another country This guy was like didnt we conquer Puerto Rico and Guam and

rubbish rule How can you declare the liberty having such a rubbish rule Dont you guys think so We can create revenue laws stuff thats totally unconstitutional for other parts of our country In other words unincorporated territories are land we control and exploit for revenue but whose people dont get to vote and dont get the right to trial by jury So yeah the Philippines in addition to Puerto Rico and Guam remained unincorporated territories a place that the US could kind of just ignore without a lot of consequence They werent important enough for strategic enough to be considered to become states like Hawaii or Alaska Well theyre only saying things that suit themselves right This is insane']"

have any prejudice I hope I dont I know that a lot of Europeans think of the Asians For example as Rather lazy I see They still have that image No you dont Asian people We dont have good people I know that you dislike for example And Indonesia you dislike the Dutch there But they probably thought they were helping you They were not helping You mentioned that we are lazy We are not Exactly lazy But they didnt give us a chance And we didnt get Experiments to build our country Well Judy I dont think all Asians are lazy No please you understand me I said that was a general opinion Maybe not now I hope so A general opinion Well its sort of wrong to say that they are lazy Lets just say that they have got the very flat feet That they cant lift them up Because we have to consider for example The climate in most of the regions in the Asia Yes you are You cant just work with all the hot the warm climate around you Of course you always feel like finding yourself Or going to an air conditioned theater or something else that We are in its cold Its kind of right a different kind of joke Is there a difference in philosophy too that perhaps we in the west have And appreciated our wonder Well as far as I know it And well I think youve mentioned it in this program That Indians think that they should never saw in their hands And in the Philippines I must admit that Well were sort of inclined to get white collar jobs and swivel chairs Most of us do especially the new college graduates We dont want to work with our hands We want to have well big bosses and with pretty secretaries around us Thats the common tendency Kind of excuse Youre not broke that we are lazy Oh gosh now youve put me in a corner I was trying to give you an example You criticize the countries which you criticize that for example But I know the British when they started doing their colonization They tried to help the countries they were in But you think that we were betting on taking away your opportunities Well yes I think so I said I would give from a sample about the deaths that We didnt get a chance to be educated for a sample That was when the Dutch was in Do you think if the people in the colony get a chance to get free You will get them Oh now were going right off the surface My friend from Malaya is very glad that Malaya She has very proud and she felt that She felt that Malaya is going to be in the final of the next year Do you think that if you do that to the other places Can you Yes we will make them satisfied We hope you will make them satisfied Every country wants to be independent Thats only natural But there comes a point somebody to decide whether they are ready to receive their independence You go off on another long arm to wonder that Maybe we can have what Im sorry Ralph I was about to ask them what do they think are the most common Or the basic causes of our prejudice is it the mainly skin color Maybe Do you mean the Do you mean for example taking the American Rublin the South I guess taking the American side of it', 'Next but is that there are less rules you could say As in if you live in Germany you know what I mean Anything you would like to do whether it is making a change in your apartment your house your car whatever it is has to get approved Yes The rules they are multiple documents have to fill out That doesnt really exist there Okay stopping right here because there is actually a rule that also defines how your garden or how like your outer area of your own house should look like So if you have certain clans that are kind of like going over the fence to your neighbor its like a huge drama Its just like you cant decide on the color of your house You have to have it approved which you know its okay to have certain rules But its a lot of bureaucracy in Europe And it works quite well For example the traffic if you used to European traffic or American traffic people you know listen to the rules they do what they do I mean sometimes here its the opposite People just drive Theres no real indication where you turn left or right most people dont even do it And it seems like It cares In the beginning And I love it So far I think Ive seen almost one car crash but actually zero within seven months To be fair most of the time I stay within the city and the traffic here is regulated We get traffic lights all that But driving itself it seems a lot more relaxed I do take a scooter almost everywhere because it is faster than anything else Youre pretty much a pedestrian a cyclist and a car at the exact same time So theres your rules for you I wouldnt recommend doing that because you know danger is whatever So much more relaxed that you can just take a scooter that you just buy And you take it anywhere and then your regulations you dont have to fill out some paper Same with like a SIM card Theyre changing that right now over the next like four five six months But if you want to get a SIM card here you just buy it You dont have to get the middetails the information nothing like that You just buy it So much easier Second to last point everything at least Yes the rules are changing So dont take this a buy If you want a buy a Lambo As a random example you can walk there Its in the city If you want to go to a spa its in the city You want to go to a dentist You want to go to have food on a rooftop bar Everything is in the city more than what Multiple times So even if you have to walk a long distance which is kilometers maximum because thats the length and the height of the city that wouldnt even hurt you Its a bit easy Just a nice walk outside because its sunny In the worst case its rained and you take an umbrella and walk there anyways Plus the city has a bunch of cats One of like stray cats just normal cats

the Philippines Because of their victories the Philippines became one of the biggest beauty pageant dynasties in the entire world With four titles behind USAs Villainswell is and Puerto Ricos An achievement that we Filipinos should be proud of Now I know that some people dont like this concept of Pinoy Pride because they find it cringe or corny and all that Well someone has something to say about that The Philippines is home a very beautiful natural resources From the beaches the mountains but I firmly believe that the best natural resource that the Philippines has is us Filipinos We are the true heart and soul of the Philippines with the way we are hospitable with the warm smiles And we are the reason why the world keeps coming back for more No matter where the universe takes me I will always be proud to call the Philippines my home And no matter what happens I will always be proud to call myself Pinoy What does Pinoy mean What does Pinoy mean Im not sure what the question is

mode of transportation and most major roads and destinations are covered Busses are also available on the main routes So what is it like to ride on a bus or in the jeep knee Its because like if you ride on a bus here youre like nervous that youre going to die So and Im not saying its just bad people Its just most people like Ive never had an issue with our trains here but the buses are very very kind of like a different story Right Because our trains everybody takes them but the buses are very gross and creepy and I just dont take them so and they dont work very well But how good are the buses Like if we took a bus should we have to worry about anything or is it pretty much hop on do your thing go Right Thats kind of why I would want to live walking distance from most things Yeah Eater taxis and grab are probably the most comfortable options The normal taxi tarot starts at cents With an additional cents Now its really cheap One hour waiting in the taxi it will be Thats really cheap Thats really cheap Between minutes and an hour well often run between to pesos So less than How much would you usually make on a hour trip A hour trip Or a minute trip A lot of money Hey theres a key Or a one hour trip So a one hour trip so I would drive a lot of people from where I live to the airport which is about a minute trip which is a minute trip And I would make anything between and maybe Somewhere around that maybe to It just depends on how much traffic there was And what time of day and all those kind of things So about times that amount Yeah Oh yeah Easily BGC about to one way And a trip to the airport from either area will be about depending on traffic Yeah Is that weather without tip Yeah With over islands and some of the worlds greatest biodiversity the Philippines is a great place to explore and travel And from Manela is fairly easy and affordable Bus and ferry transportation is also efficient and very inexpensive Hello This is the life in the Philippines This is the life in the Philippines Shes all posing and stuff They are welcoming to different cultures And there is a large expat community in Manela as well Everybodys on their phone Yeah You see that Easy for expats from all around the world Its the biggest texting place in the world Filipinos are world renowned for their hospitality and their friendliness For more cost of living guides and traveling for many years Lets do', 'Breaking the piggy bank Now if youve entered the mall in order to pick up a simple toy for your child Get ready to hold onto your wallet Filipino kids generally dont have as many toys as their western counterparts And this can be one reason why In the west cheap Chinese toys are available everywhere for a couple dollars But here the same items can cost up to five times as much Oh For example This my little pony only cost seven dollars at that American Walmart But here the exact same toy is bucks Oh I swear Hey I kid you now I thought about that number Yeah Yeah you need to do the lot of I think the numbers Id be wrong point dollars for a pony for a pony Were gonna have to make a pony for a pony Gonna make a pony go buy a pony so the kids dont play with toys Literally like that much to the point where you know youre gonna price the tags all we are you just gonna Put it up Theyre gonna hold onto the toys Oh yeah I want to pay for you guys Maybe thats all you gotta still have thats why when you graduate high school So so far we made it through the mall Intrance right and then and are we looking at for shopping for our kids and thats kind of like the way she go on with this You know we make it and then we look for things for our kids And um yeah were gonna keep walking we aint gonna stop talking about the ponies No Im glad No no no touch Thats no toys that long we dont buy that no average Filipino kid doesnt have a bedroom full of toys true For the weeks wage for a piece of plastic The weird thing is that these toys come from the same place right China Which is a lot closer to us than it is to you So question for the moms and the dads and Philippines was up What age do you guys stop the kids from playing with toys Mmhmm you know Im saying because obviously its a thing Well we dont stop them Well they stop at their own we do Yeah that is true and yeah so thats the question What age do yall do they typically stop do they typically stop thats a great way to put it there So whats the reason for the big difference in prices Once again I have no clue But when I have a kid Im gonna teach him to play outside Oh why should yourself speaking of expensive toys if you try to buy a household appliance Dont expect to find one like youre used to Things like dishwashers and clothes dryers are often about twice as much as they cost in the West And lets you want to buy the little toy versions like this one which is completely made of plastic Oh yes These are the actual appliances Not something you find in the same department as easybake office With college now this washers a little on a small side but at least its only US Why so cheap because its a four model with a hole in the front window duh Not only are appliances incredibly expensive but you can imagine how difficult it is to get them serviced Most parts have to be ordered and good luck finding someone qualified to install them So its no wonder that washing machines and dryers are considered luxury items and even comparatively wealthy Filipinos just hire a housekeeper to do the work by hand So you can see million peso homes with clothes lines strong up in the backyard', 'So we found that our food costs are gone after the last For five months Not just for Christmas but in general by shopping in the supermarket rather than the public market Sometimes its convenient to go to the supermarket when youre going to the mall and then you just go straight to the supermarket Yeah especially when you go in there for a couple of odd terms but you end up buying other things For example for vegetables in the supermarket we dont ever recommend buying your vegetables from the supermarket A couple of reasons the prices is the first cauliflower and broccoli around plus pesos a kilo to Its much better Its still not cheap compared to what it was in the UK But where we are in LAT theres good supply of vegetables like that So its reasonable price We did find actually a manila that things are broccoli work A hundred pesos a kilo even Yeah its much cheaper Which means that Its absolutely amazed us how the food costs in different parts of the country Its a different based on supply Theres a big big variety of prices all fiberfilippines So again coming back to the budget just quickly our budget works for us in LAT Our budget might not work for somebody in Manila or Samu It does vary dont it depending on where you live Its far more loose in the province Yeah Not everything in there Not everything As you see the broccoli cauliflower is much cheaper in Manila We move into Manila We check the prices of the vegetables Some are much cheaper but here in the supermarket its much much per kilo Much more Yeah to per kilo But in the same supermarket in the very same supermarket but in Manila its only Its a big difference In our ideal world there will be a really good supply for all the supermarkets in the Philippines and they can supply every region at the same price That would be perfect but thats not going to happen any time soon So your best bet is to go to the local market and buy from local vendors local sellers the farmers directors you can Most of where we are theres lots of vegetables being sold at good prices very reasonable prices Thats the best way you can get your budget down for food Its shop local Its quite nice as well to support the locals Its not far to go It helps them out It helps you out And it keeps them going We buy our meat generally from the supermarket as its more convenient for us to buy in bulk The prices are very similar to the market The public market that is Theres not much differences there really Pork chops for example chicken breast chicken wings Theres the real theyve got a difference from the supermarket and the local market Weve also do a lot of online shopping but not for items mostly for food As if you buy stuff in bulk online you get some really good deals We find its much cheaper to order or youre able to walk online rather than buying on the supermarket Absolutely yeah Back if its more back if its much You buy you pay much more than the supermarket package goods Sometimes in the market you can get it for a good price but the supply isnt always there Easy to buy it for in a place like Shoppy or Lazara You pay a little bit of delivery costs but sometimes you get a financial purchase so its not much at all And you can stock up on stuff that What you call kitchen essentials for cooking for snacks ingredients Thats how we can save a lot of money and we do save a lot of money that way']"

idea what Philippines Or you never really thought there is Philippines its yours Youre honest yeah well I remember when I moved to China I lived in China for almost five years And the first time I met a Filipino Was in China It was quite a few Filipinos playing in the light bands And Im going to the bar I met some of them And thats when that could Philippines on the map for me And I started inquiring about it Finding out more about the Philippines And the Filipinos I met in China And youre there In conversation just the type of people I was So you have an idea already Of some Filipino personality view Can I say that Well I mean I met a few I mean were talking about maybe six or seven Filipinos that Ive met in China So you have really a little just a little Like idea I think the question for you I realized that Very easygoing people very easy to get along with So I kind of set my mind thats the kind of people they are Very simple very easygoing Wow take that again Simple and easygoing Anyways my question for you is When youre living here for two years now So how was it What did you discover about Filipinos Well the fact that everyone is very easygoing in general And enjoying a simple lifestyle enjoying the simple things in life You know they can just sit around the table and have fun And have a laugh enjoy a conversation So they can enjoy the simple things in life And we should really be appreciating and enjoying And another thing I learned about Filipinos If you go out you eat Its like doesnt matter whats the occasion they have to be food and a wife And make sure theyre right Make sure theyre right Right right is life So yeah thats not a thing thats very obvious you know Without any food on the table thats a very important part of the culture of the food here Yeah of course And I dont know other things Well like we have to I have to know like we do experience And also like a little bad sign You can discover something about Filipinos That sign But just be careful because were near the ocean I can throw you off I dont know what youre answer Youre first Right I mean I say bad things Spins you can avoid you should only be aware of We actually discussed that in a previous video When we talked about like crap mentality You know its the kind of they love to gossip And maybe you know rumour spread maybe Through gossip the information changes and stuff Yeah its spreading on Yeah they love to talk and Theres even a joke about it I remember it now Like if a single woman is eating like mango Green mango And then they will say is she pregnant All right Yeah that mentality Yes not a bad thing maybe is eating salt with your fruit Yeah salt of course Thats a yeah so you see a few strange habits that you dont see everywhere Like well green mango with some salt But then I realized that you can almost eat any fruit with some salt And so theres some strange things that you know I just dont like That I wouldnt do Ive tried it but yeah I dont see the purpose really But they like that flavor And thats just what they used to So its not a bad thing its just a strange thing in a way', 'So what are we talking about honey I just want to discuss about expectation versus reality Expectations versus reality of what Living here in the Philippines I mean what are expectations Do you have any expectations before you come here Did I have any expectations I did yeah Before coming to the Philippines All right yeah what I want to say is I guess everyone has some kind of expectations Before they move to a new place you have all these ideas And what you think its going to be like and what youre going to do But yeah the reality is always a little different Okay I dont know anything specific you can think of Well do you have like imaginations or ideas what the Philippines looks like Well I have come here to visit before So yeah before I decided to move here I did come and visit Grace quite a few times And its been a year prior to visiting her So we just came around to the guy Im losing you Oh we cant go through there We cant go through there I know And start there Few engineers later Youre saying Yeah you have ideas before you come and visit Philippines So yeah I said yeah we have been here a few times Probably like one two three or four months came to visit her But before that Before that Yeah you dont have any idea what Philippines looks like Yeah so but do you have like some ambition of it You expect something like its going to be Well sure when you hear Philippines is a tropical country And you see photos of Boracay You imagine all these white beaches And palm trees everywhere And the ideal tropical island spot So yeah if I had to refer to When I came When I actually came to visit you the first time I mean where Grace lives I guess In Kageando Aura I mean you have to really go out of the city area To find something With a white beach But here on the coast here You guys have seen the previous videos Theres no real white tropical beaches and stuff But I mean here is still very mountainous And beautiful trees palm trees and stuff like that So I guess yeah I guess in that way I guess you could call it a little disappointment Yes in a way that you expected these clear blue water And white beaches you know So in that way yeah when you came here and saw Ah yes only Grace Wow Im sure Lets have a look You look here behind us right Its a grey sand Its grey sand yeah its not a white beach And the water itself as well I guess Water itself yeah its not the blue clear tropical waters I think its a reason for it here I mean theres a lot of rivers running into the ocean Yeah its just close here theres a river And sometimes when its flooded its the mud pushed through the ocean Thats right yeah so I mean I mean the sugar swam there I have swam there before You did liar I did liar So yeah I could still enjoy the water I mean its not the ideal tropical holiday spot put it that way But you can drive like minutes away from here And find a white beach in Imi Tau Thats quite nice over there Its very cold its very cold Its very cold its very cold Its weird look at ourself right And here he is

appearance just my appearance it sounds like a normal normal bread but lets try maybe the taste is different oh theres a plain version that would be clever its inside its just too soft yeah its cheese no its plain oh wait those oh wait wait wait there is something here this one tastes like a plain actually let me try a second bite actually slide to one side only so the other half dont have cheese yeah but its kind of common its kind of common in the picture you see this ones okay but yeah for five pesos all right let me try the other one I want to get a review of Hope lets see whats this on top actually and that is brown sugar what uh no its like the the flower family okay right so the excess yeah okay how was it tastes like bread nice bread right how would you compare it with the other one I think it tastes more or less the same actually they taste very similar but um they are really fresh bread so I like it I guess one thing we notice in Manila is that when we buy try to buy fresh fat like the ones from two Market theyre not really fresh theyre like the ones that theyre very soft so like a sponge but these ones are fresh because you can feel the texture mmm tasty oh I see a cheese now is that cheese yeah see its only on one side so if you find the right side and you might miss out the teeth thats why its advisable to eat in the right person Im not full thank you how do you say have a good day um yeah youre gonna say Parliament yeah interesting experience yeah even I a local one its kind of hard to say right all right next destination lets go here first okay on this side all right so I think Im gonna give a break for the GoPro first just to let it cool down so Ill see you guys when we arrive the next destination Segment Trying Marikinas Everlasting pesos right what is this actually so this is the local dish of Marikina yes uh its composed of uh only in Marikina yeah Everlasting yes this originated I like the name Everlasting it sounds interesting why can you keep it for a long time or Everlasting yeah you can just put it on your refrigerator so thats why the name you can keep it forever its a kimchi you can just like slice um if you want to eat just

sense makes sense yeah okay all right so we can have like pizza okay sounds good all right lets give this a try Segment Eating Everlasting with Rice wow its like it is spicy not really not spicy okay but finally that one has like the tomato sauce yeah it smells like tomato sauce what was it I like it you taste I like it dancing when its good for you got a dance yes I see I mean it really makes you have the idea of the rice though now I see it will be overpowered but if we mix the rice theres five pixels yeah dig in I think that racing gives it a bit of extra sweetness into it so it makes a dish its like a mix of salty and sweet but its not too salty yeah so its just right I think really delicious the texture is like a meatloaf right right yeah okay she said that since its freshly cooked still kind of soft but once you like put it on the chiller and okay lets get hotter yeah yeah it becomes like tastier and its very tastier you said after refrigerated yeah so its meant to be harder yeah I thought its gonna be soft but its really tasty all right let me try to eat with the egg lets see if uh it makes a big difference all right just send that bite didnt have the Egg and I want to get a bit of everything so Ive got a rice in here too really just randomly like uh sketch the the ingredients or is it like in a pattern feelings feelings all right every day yep thats it just a mix of different texture thats why yeah I think all right its a good fish something new in the Philippines because Im having it its like Christmas in your mouth Christmas in my mouth yeah hahaha thats right butterfly what a candle here can be a birthday cake but yeah overall tasty experience all right cool all right anyway now lets enjoy this because its really delicious alright so we just finished the meal here this place actually called Cuisine which means the kitchen of twins because apparently uh they say their boss boss born to Twin and then they also have twin daughters so thats why its like a family in DNA twins but yeah overall it was a good experience trying one of the local Delicacies here in Marikina okay now its coming out naturally in my mouth you guys just now I keep pronouncing it wrong but yeah this place was visited by a lot of celebrities uh even TV shows at night okay I think right now Im already oh thats the thing I actually got some takeaways here maybe for a later try basically the lady just sent was saying the ingredients of this is made of mostly meatloaf um and then there is tomato sauce and there is garlic and onion and there is Segment Heading to Remys and Trying Puto green pepper yeah capsicums maybe uh not chili ones like yeah the green one yeah the green one so yeah Oprah is quite interesting experience I guess inside them I mean the meatloaf itself is tender and I think because its meatloaf so its already like processed meat so its meant to last longer I guess thats also one of the names why its called Everlasting as well all right whats the next destination captain as I said um I forgot to tell you that to prepare to prepare your stomach okay prepare my stomach yeah thats it I was not ready to eat so much today yeah so

one of these then lets try this this looks interesting I dont know if I can finish it but when I get home I can get Elena to try this as well I think would be quite an interesting experience but its made of rice yeah wow lots of our desserts and fruit here in the Philippines are made with rice yeah all right that shes on top thats awesome so this original uh this one is original plain this original whats different between plain and original well of course the plain one is like rice The Taste is like plain okay okay and then theres the original original one yeah right yeah with a bit of both sides and the Uber one and then thats the one with the sticky rice thats gonna be a very sticky meal gonna get like my CocaCola with me eat together okay all right thank you very much all right lets give this a try all right Ill hold this swap Segment Puto Taste Test that ones your favorite all right lets try this one first then its uh quite like squishy okay just come at the last one this one is more flavor its a little bit sweet so its nice but its not overly sweet quite nice again its like a jelly kind of thing interesting maybe I need some drinks actually oh is that always going to get a little bit too big actually I have got Ive got two pictures hold it for you oh yes please youre my assistant all right next one see thats the thing all these um flavors have a very subtle taste so its not very strong you can taste a little bit of that flavor but its not very strong so I mean is the difference is Im very subtle I would say for me thats still tasty I think Uber is actually more tasty than the last one I think because I like poopy in general all right this is um they say with sticky rice inside there is something here its like Jackfruit no its Jesus whoa this one has a very strong Taste of egg I dont know if they actually have egg inside but its just strong it has an egg taste like boiled egg kind of taste so its quite interesting I think um this one is better than the Uber one so its one two three no one two three all right who knows me the flame one is most delicious lets see hmm its plain but yeah its a good snack I think um when youre hungry in the afternoon you can just eat this one yeah its a good snack thank you yeah overall interesting delicacy yeah if you in this area then try this rice cake I would say yeah you want some no your turn yeah which one is your favorite personally this one in this one these two but I havent tried this one yet okay try this try this what do you think its like this one with a bit flavor yeah but I say the difference very subtle you know yeah it has Uber flavor but its not that strong yeah so whats your order now wait let me remember lets see lets see if your reaction is the same as mine ah this is one one yeah yeah I think same for me that ones a one can you taste like extra egg text taste then the texture which was better compared I agree this one is more like um like a jelly kind of thing more chewy so

into my sandmig light Okay So look I enjoy sitting at fillies bar on the perch and having some gentle conversation with the locals or the foreigners who are next to me I mean look I do despise those foreigners who talk crudely to the ladies who are walking by There are a lot of you know there are a lot of prosties Lets call them working girls in the area and they do walk by A lot of them do walk by especially at night And they want they want you to buy them Okay lets just put it that way And some guys here some foreign guys sad to say you know they ask some of the girls they asked to sort of

nothings happening there at night Anyway after my one beer there my one nightly beer Ill walk down walking street but this time I will head back home Now if I show walking street bid at night time you know Ill be demonetized here This wont make any dough and then I cant pay my rent Yes I know You probably realize Im a bit of a loner Im also cheap and I have no fun but hey you got to understand This is fun For me you got to understand theres seven billion people on the planet Okay everyone has their own definition of what fun is Okay another person will have another idea of fun that requires more money but you know right here what youre seeing here is my idea of fun I just like to relax you know talk to the guy next to me in the bar or just stare out the street watch the world go by Thats fun for me Im always deep in thought with something']"

friends asia', 'filipino', 'philippine', 'korean people', 'koreans']","['Hi everyone its Ryuk from Japan and today I got a request from my Filipino viewer to share my thoughts about this hashtag Cancel Korea trending now in the Philippines So Im going to explain to you about what this hashtag is about Cancel Korea hashtag started because a famous TikToker fell up porch Contravery her tattoo over the rising sun with a wartime army flag of Japan on her social media and some Korean netizens are really angry against her and sending her messages like Philippines are short poor and uneducated and Bella apologizes to them but however many Filipino citizens are really angry against nasty comments and expressing their anger towards Korean with this hashtag Cancel Korea Japan is really related to this Cancel Korea hashtag because Bella had a rising sun flag tattoo and this how it all started it made many Korean people angry and as Japanese Im really sad that this is happening right now in', 'Today even if both the Philippines and South Korea have experienced a similar past both of their views towards Japan have diveraged years after the war According to a study by the Pew Research Center in only of South Koreans have favorable views towards Japan Oh really Most experts believe that South Koreas distance towards the next country to Japan is supposed unwillingness to fully acknowledge the countrys wartime activities or make amends Remnants of the war such as comfort women and the rising sun flag are still present today and are big reminders to the Koreans of one of Koreas most painful moments in history As a response South Korea has worked hard to lift themselves up from the hardships of the past through reverse colonialism in Japan through the success of Kpop Kdramas and Kculture as the soft power and improving their consumer electronics which was once an industry hud by Japan On the other hand the Philippines and Filipinos up to this day have mostly positive impressions on Japan and the Japanese people The same study by the Pew Research Center of Filipinos have favorable views of Japan as a country making the Philippines their second sons future as a country Even if the Philippines was one of the worst hit nations by Japan through its occupation and World War II today the Philippines is made in Japan as a sign of topquality products the Japanese as clean hardworking and wellamounted people to look up to and Japan itself has become a wellloved travel destination by Filipinos in recent years and a country who has greatly helped the Philippines rise up through postwar time reparations and other major economic endeavors even up to the present However to end we pose a new question Are reparations remembering and moving forward the best way to support the comfort women who still owe antique for justice to this day Thats difficult question Oh you remain this difficult question in the end Wow Yeah well what do you think about it guys In my opinion I dont think those are the best way because I think even those son of victims is by money or is a reparation makes you forget about the past I dont think so Humans are not so you know our heart is not so easy dont you think so Whats important is not apology but its reflection reflecting about the past and never repeated the same thing staying in this state again People in young age know about it like Im not sure if you know what Im saying but Im not sure why they dont blame for the past I think thats what proper ideas should be these days And as for Korea or Chinese I hate in Japan Yeah thats true but I think its totally because of their governmental education You know economically or you know territorypoly in rival So yeah they make use of the past for the negotiation because you know every time we conflict each other they refer to their past Things really brutal done by different imperial jet beings So yeah theres government just make take advantage of victims Thats sacks but you know thats one of the strategy cannot be held So yeah Id do that too if I were them for the negotiations And with Japanese for educated people I believe its including me Of course we know about the history Some of them done by Japanese are really brutal Its not right We dont justify that but we never feel like that We have to apologize for that because its about the past like years ago Imagine like you know my ground ground darence down something wrong So I apologize for that Thats sacks right Yeah so like we just dont really care Like you guys when we see a country you know past doesnt really bother to our interest Yeah so this video makes me thinking this kind of things To be honest I didnt really like only young people were introduced I wanted to also listen you know opinion from all ages because you know it must be totally different idea They master how to do different ideas And where the hell Pinot voice gone Thats it for today Thank you for watching my video I hope you like it If you do make sure to like button and subscribe please So mata ose', 'Hey guys Jessica here this morning I woke up reading a lot of comments messages emails and emails from Korea requesting English to very fairly about this issue that arise from the so Pino Tiktokr Bella Port shes a lot of people shes a team right and that also led to the formation of cash tag cancel Korea in the Philippines asking for apology from Koreans and also I guess to raise awareness towards racial discrimination against the Filipinos When I first heard about this keyword cancel Korea I was like what yeah yeah I know I know it was such an surprising issue word cancel Korea thank you so much to those really aggressive about this issue as well to give you a summary of this issue yeah thats what started from the Filipina Tiktok star Bella Port and the netizens noticed that on her arm there was a thats what Im talking about thats Japanese flag symbol I hope you guys all know what the rising sun flag is all about and it is especially traumatizing for Koreans because that flag about a few stories during the forceful Japanese occupation here in Korea which lasted for about years so that flag is associated with Japanese imperialism and due to the imperial Japans mistreatment during that time of occupation the flag can be very offensive for many Koreans that is why we are especially sensitive about this so I took a look into her tattoo if it was really similar to that rising sun flag and I noticed that it really reminded me of that flag no wonder why many Koreans were reacting quite negatively about this I do understand where theyre coming from so Bella has made a public I see I think this is a fact Japanese have to know what she said was completely right absolutely right so let me explain about the rising sun flag a bit so that rising sun has a very good meeting for Japanese its called the kyo kujisuki in Japanese we call something celebrating like waiting is a good example we call it sunny day yeah harinoki in Japanese so in our culture the sun brings us luck as you can imagine our national flag its it represents the sun so now you know how important the sun is for Japanese but the flag used to be different it was like rising sun like she said why we changed it because people recognize that it is a symbol of impire Japan as you can as you guys know they colorize the many countries of Korea and if it means a one of it so of course people have that image for this rising sun flag especially Korean so this girls behavior you know showing the touch of a symbol of you know Japanese rising sun tattoo its going to far yeah now I know this went to such a big issue yeah I get it public apology regarding her tattoo she has said that at that time I didnt know the history but when I found out I really had it covered and scheduled for removal I am ashamed of myself for not doing my research I sincerely apologize in addition she said that please educate yourself and learn more about it because it came from a terrible history now its good yeah she learned the lesson she learned her lesson yeah she was just you know she wasnt really educated so thats why she made a mistake but now she learned her lesson so yeah thats okay great please learn from my mistake']"

Miguel isnt allowed to sell its Magnolia ice cream in the United States Thats because this Magnolia ice cream is made from a different company And essentially what they did is they used a logo and obviously a name thats very similar to the one youll find in the Philippines to market their product to Filipino Americans here in the US So the family that basically runs the Magnolia company here in the US its a Northern California family Theyre based out of Pittsburgh California actually up in the Bay Area And theyve been making Magnolia ice cream here in the States since So today were going to try this Magnolia ice cream buco pandan macapuno ube encased okay so flavor original Filipino style in an ice cream sandwich version So I premade these guys and I did put them in the freezer so that the ice cream wouldnt melt but now the breads a little bit hard But this is basically your Filipino ice cream sandwich I never remember the first time I saw something like this We were watching an episode of bizarre foods with Andrew Zimmer and he was out walking the streets of the Philippines and he came up on this cart where they were literally making ice cream sandwiches It looked just like this with a hamburger bun and they were just scooping ice cream in it They had a little bit of condiments and such but I dont have any of those today so were just going to eat them just like this So weve got the ube macapuno flavor which is lets see the purple yum obviously ube my favorite queers favorite and its got a little bit of the macapuno in it which is a young coconut Young coconut again here with the buco pandan flavor and this one has the pandan leaf flavoring to it so its kind of got that little bit of an nuttiness and then obviously the coconut flavoring from the buco and then weve got a queso queso over here So thats something Ive never tried before is cheese ice cream and this is cheese ice cream with a little bit of cheese in it so I am very much looking forward to giving that a try', 'So we have a dessert today called halohalo Man Thats pretty good Xiaoma Isnt that great Wow Whats in this Three two one whats going on everybody its Xiaoma And were back with

feels very different I cant believe its an hour away from Manila Its crazy isnt it Hour and Depends how fast you drive Yeah Yeah I dont think the dog needs nice guys Yeah really nice Again its completely different to anywhere weve seen before Yeah Maybe theres some similarities with the views But it does feel different It definitely feels different Yeah I agree And I think what makes it different is that it feels like quite far away from staff Although it feels like its kind of very different to anywhere else But then theres like the Yalamore here Theres like Starbucks everywhere Theres loads of shops like it I expected it to be quite a quiet place So And it seems this place was highly recommended to do the volcano trip And I figured itd be kind of like St Juliana that we went to And that was kind of like a halfway point Very small village with access to the tour Because we didnt really set this place a tour before coming here Which I like I was really nicely surprised Yeah yeah Me too I dont like knowing too much like Vegan We had the genuine reaction to that place Because we didnt research it We didnt know what to expect You tell us to go somewhere and we go there And then we figure out what its like for us to have So Best way to do I think I agree Is it so nice and chill doesnt it Yeah So nice Should we end off the vlog here Yeah Cool Thank you for watching today

Lets hear it for Lachon We all love Lachon You love Lachon I love Lachon I mean come on When we were there in the Philippines the last visit a couple of years ago it was like a combination of my stepdaughter the stepson my wife I and our little cousin We all have birthdays in November So we were all there early November and we had a huge party Plus it was around all Saints day So we had a huge party tons of food We sprung for the Lachon We had a whole Lachon It was the first time I experienced that It was very very cool and very very delicious We can get it here in New Jersey Its a special order If you want the whole thing Ive not done that We dont have that many people around us Unfortunately as Ive mentioned its just my wife and I So its really but we do get the Lachon Kuali which is the fried Lachon But if you have not experienced Lachon proper Lachon youre missing out Its number five I would think itd be higher on the list in front of that blood stew But nevertheless this is authenticfoodquestcoms list And they put it at number five Number six on the list Kuala Kuala meets doing peanut sauce I dont know if Ive had this I look familiar to me Youre seeing the photo right now It looks familiar to me I think I have but its not something that pops into my mind It says here with thick and creamy peanut sauce there is no mistake to save the goodness of Kuala Kuala It is another famous Filipino dish just recently made of ox tail However regional variations can include beef pork goat and chicken So they have it It looks kind of Kuala and I had stuff thats this color But I think that was curry that I had That was that color curry chicken So lets move on Number seven peanut bet Again it could be butchering this but it looks delicious Ive not had this dish Its on my list to try It looks fantastic But theyve got it at number seven Pinak bet is a Filipino dish originating from the Locos region the Ilocano meal The name of the dish is an Ilocano word derived from the term Pinak bet or shrimp or shrivel So its shriveled mixed vegetables in shrimp sauce This traditional dish consists of mixed vegetables such as string beans egg plant okra bitter melon and winged beans So it looks interesting It definitely does if not had it This is something and thats why this article grabbed me because this stuff on his list that Ive not had yet I definitely want to try So let us know in the comments if you have experienced pinak bet and what you thought of it So lets move along Number eight Now this I have had and Im going to tell you about that chicken in a saw chicken barbecue And they actually show and youre seeing it right now manganasal One of my favorite places to go into Philippines manganasal with the bottomless rice You heard that if youve not been to the Philippines yet and you love rice youre going to love manganasal I dont know how they prepare that chicken It is delicious Its the best oh its very very very good They serve it on the stick what youre seeing right now But they come around you know like in the US if youre in a cafe or a diner and you have in breakfast and the waitress will come around with the coffee pot More coffee sir More coffee sir Well over there at manganasal the guys got a big old bucket under his arm More rice sir More rice mom I was like what And they also have a couple of sinks in the back of the place and everybody gets up washes their hands before because you eat in this all with your hands They do have the silverware I did do American style and ate with the US But I did American style slash Filipino because I ate with the pork and spoon No knife And you need to learn how to do that if youre heading to the Philippines I kind of like well first time I experienced was like what is the knife But Ive learned now how to do it and I kind of like it and we like that here every day We put a fork and a spoon out and thats it and thats how I eat now Unless Im eating some good steak and in that case I put the steak knife out But yeah if its really good steak you should be able to pull it apart with the fork and spoon But yeah chicken and a salt Chicken and a salt commonly known as in a in a salt is the Philippines famous barbecue or grilled chicken It is from the Vesias region celebrated in Bacolid City where it is affectionately fared to as chicken or a monocon country Chicken and a salt Check this article out Ill put the link to the article in the description They go into a little bit more the history of each of these dishes']"

arent they What are you usually doing during the rest of the day and lightning I cover my head and my ears If I cant see it I cant hear it Its not there I thought Im the only one who was really good but youre a worst at this Its like when you watch the movie Ted you remember Ted with the bear with Mark Wahlberg They have a song about thunder Im not going to repeat it for YouTube Its got some offensive language in it But people laugh at that but people that hate and scare the thunder I know how you feel I really do And people here they unfortunately do die from thunderstorms Yes theres so many accidents house born or animals to get hit by thunder Its quite scary Hit by lightning Hit by the lightning hit the thunder The thunder is sort of In some ways when you see the lightning and you havent heard the thunder youve relieved Because you know its not going to hit you It was already hit the floor But sometimes it can come out of nowhere There was one time we were in the kitchen and it was instant It was flashbang It came out of nowhere There was no rain no warning Face sudden For me by far this is the biggest shock or biggest surprise weve had The biggest negative Its that Im now scared Not scared of everything Believe it or not the snake over here I actually like snakes Im not afraid of them I dont like the ones I can bite you and kill you but the big ones Theyre quite peaceful and relaxing to watch Believe it or not But Not for Jane But the thunder yeah by far that was the biggest negative so far They were other negatives obviously but again living in the Philippines Youre going to have good things youre going to have bad things We dont dwell on the negative on our channel The reason is why Why moan and nag and you know thats what you do in England Thats where we came from Everyone moans and nag Well a moment everybody but we used to We changed We left that sort of attitude behind when we moved here We wanted to come here and make a fresh start Not be negative and we didnt want to show negativity Unless we have to If it wasnt set obviously wed have discussed it Wed talk about it wed show it But theres no point being negative for the sake of it because you cant change things You just adapt enjoy get all your lives', 'Its really good and Im happy to see you again in my channel Im Sylvia and Im your host Before we even start this video Id like to tell you that my heart goes to all of those whove been severely affected by this environmental disaster which is Typhoon Rye Okay my heart also goes to the environment because this typhoon doesnt just ruin cities and homes but it also ruins the environment you know like forests and such Now having said that last week I reacted to a news video about this horrible typhoon A subscriber saw that video and contacted me and suggested that I react to another video called typhoon Odette right Hits Shiaragau Dina Gat Southern Late Table Hall and Sibu Bagyeon Okay but I thought that I wasnt just going to react to the video I thought that we should do something different here So I did some research and I tried to look up some organizations that can help with you know the destruction that this typhoon did in the Philippines And I found six I will put the links in the description and I will pin it in the comments So we got Palapino Workers Center UNICEF Center of Disaster Philanthropy Global Giving Local Lab and Kids for Kids okay I leave it at your discretion if youd like to help okay But personally I will give however much I can but for those of you who want to help but cant what were going to do is your job basically is just going to have to share this video as much as you can because the amount that it will garner in hours I will give that money as well to one of these organizations all right So the more its shared the more its viewed and the more basically money it will garner So yeah thats what I will be doing with the amount of money that the video will garner in hours Now you know everything but before we start consider following me on Instagram at Music Game News and if you have a preferred choice of these organizations that I should give the money to let me know in the comment section below because Im not familiar with all these organizations The only one that I know is UNICEF but UNICEF I dont know if it actually has anything to do with the Philippines but you know like Palapino Workers Center it has Filipino in it Global Giving Local Lab I think all the other ones are actual Filipino organizations so those sound more legit to me like I want to give to a Filipino organization So if you can help me out with that Id be grateful If I dont have any suggestions then I will just have to donate to any of these organizations', 'Alright lets get to the

Malaysians ass Show me the slow move I want to see the slow move Wow check out the scene You know it reminds me of capuera as well Interesting I just noticed Oh I just noticed The guy that serves the ball doesnt do it all by himself He has a teammate that sends the ball to him and then he serves it with his leg right with his foot Bam yeah He doesnt like throw it in the air and and serve his its nope Its a its a jewel thing Yo Philippines wins the first what do you call that The first set So there are three sets REJahn Regen That was a very soft shot They did not expect it because he didnt serve it very well Oh Bale My god seriously if the Philippines wins this game like Filipinos excel at so many activities and sports Wow Who got the point Who got that point I dont know oh Yeah the the the Philippines right Thats so cool He is so tall And he can he must be so freaking flexible a tall guy thats this flexible Its crazy Wow its actually very Whats the word Im looking for elegance Wow yo Malaysia is coming back in this set bra Oh yeah I think Malaysia is gonna win this second set And then its gonna be like a super tight set in the third one He are kicking their ass Yo I might even leave the entire game for you guys to watch this is so freaking entertaining If I dont have any like copyright issues or whatever Yo this is so Its basically more entertaining than Tennis people love tennis but I find it boring man Its a nice game but its not that entertaining to watch this is entertaining What the hell I think its so freaking impressive they are gymnasts Athletes real athletes Yo Malaysia is gonna kick Philippines ass like real quick with this second set Its not even a debate Oh yep yeah No contest I Feel like Malaysia Love the Philippines to sleep with the first set they were like yeah were gonna let you think if you can that you can win But in the second set were gonna bring out the big guns Oh Wow they did not expect it Finish it Thats it wow the second set is done already that was so fast All right third and final sit Im guessing', 'Today the average NBA player measures or centimeters would fall Yes first maybe Its a passing call Could you imagine how well the standard PBA player would fare against someone like Shaquille ONeal who in his prime stood at and weighed in at pounds At that difference he would have at least two Hes at And there wouldnt be anything a Filipino player could do Like pounds And pray that he misses free throws With the rest of the world making great strides and basketball To be fair guys I dont care how tall you are Shaquille ONeal was dominant no matter how big You could be his same size and his natural ability would kick your ass So But yeah no thats why Mexicans dont play basketball Theyre short Yeah The Philippines has a one dream that burns bright in a lot of peoples hearts having a homegrown Filipino playing the NBA Now the NBA is clearly the meridian of professional basketball There is no higher level of basketball Granted there have been players with Filipino blood in the NBA Raymond Townsend became the first Filipino to ever play in the NBA playing for the Golden State Warriors in He also have Jordan Clarkson who started his career on the Lakers and currently plays for the Cavaliers And as a joke a lot of Filipinos like to include Nate Robinson Whos he so short Great grandfather was Filipino who jumped out to about That makes him an honorary Filipino I guess Hes also like five foot Hes waiting for our own son my friend Many PacYo to grace the courts of professional American basketball Little could ever be a native homegrown Filipino NBA player Many have tried notably Jatath Aguilar and Bobby RayVarks Jr of the PVA Bobby actually played for the Texas legends in the NBA GLeague but none yet who have made it into the big leagues I was actually able to speak with Raymond Townsend the first Filipino basketball player to ever play in the NBA Is a Filipino whos one considered one of the best players in the history of the PVA going to put his reputation out there to possibly get cut by Brooklyn Nets or the Orlando Magic or Sacramento Kings or the Phoenix Suns Yeah Are they going to sit there and have the rest of their life soandso is one of the best Filipinos ever play in the PVA But cant even make it in the NBA But can never make the NBA got cut in you know with the Phoenix Suns So its not a question of talent Its a question of like fear or courage Nobodys ever done it You know its harder for the first person than it is for anybody else Because with being the first theres a lot of doubt I was told Id never make it Theres a lot of negative input and theres a lot of negative input I was too small I was Filipino I wasnt big enough You know but they dont know the heart of a Filipino', 'Yo Im gonna bet on the Philippines because I know what theyre capable of But Malaysians are so freaking good Wow that was a nice save Oh Okay good save though Hes like Wow man his serves are deadly number And hes always doing this to the guy CC always like soft soft Oh nice Okay so three two right I think so three two Yeah yeah yeah cuz they had the yeah Oh Three three Tight tight tight tight This is exciting Yo I dont get it I dont see that many people in the audience I Would pay to watch this man Its so entertaining Yeah Four three for Malaysia Yeah yeah yeah yeah Oh Up up up Five three Malaysia six three why six three Did it count for like two points Up Oh thats way too easy Thats way too easy Yeah of course Seven three Yeah that was like a gift for them man Yeah I think the the Filipino guy that serves is not as good as the the Malaysian guy Wow Malaysia dude Come on Philippines you can do this all right eight five That was such a soft serve I think they never expect a soft serve Wow that was a lot stronger but he was able to Eight six Come on and Im so impressed that they never touched it frickin knit What five How was that possible I dont know man I guess I dont really understand the rules Okay dont tell me thats a point for for Malaysia Yeah so I guess that circle in the middle Its where the guy who serves needs to set his foot in Oh Wow okay Theyre fighting theyre fighting the Philippines Okay its not over yet Id be happy either way whether Malaysia or Philippines wins I Have zero stakes in this anyways Wow wow Dude its either they hurt their bodies when they fall or their wrists Yeah Im pretty sure that sometimes they have to To like pause the game and see exactly where the ball falls to count the The points Wow Yo this guy the number one Philip from the Philippines He is a ninja And hes short too but look at him Wow Yo but Malaysia is far ahead He barely touched it just nope and I wonder if he did that on purpose or He just missed like do they always try to go for like a strong Thats or not Yeah of course theres no way Yeah Im gonna leave the entire thing if I can and cuz its worth it Its so freaking enjoyable Pish Wow He had no space to save it and yet he did and that his teammate reacted so well So So the set ends at right yo come on Philippines You gotta step your game up What happened Oh wait the ball fell oh So the point air formula is from Malaysia thats crazy good Damn But if the ball had fought fell Had fallen on The on the Filipino court I think they would have lost that point But it fell outside wow All right two more points for Malaysia and were done Oh Malaysia again oh boy all right oh here we go Its over its over They won the entire thing right is it over The This sports is crazy man Yeah Malaysia was extremely good they want two sets pretty easily in my opinion Wow I You go so they said that Malaysia will face Japan or Thailand yeah oh Thailand could be good at this game too right So my gosh let me know in the comment section The origins of the game like which country invented this game where did it start Its so impressive seriously because these guys Have to be gymnasts right they they are super athletes And they have to be Accurate with their feet not just the feet they can control the ball with their heads their shoulders and everything They have to be very fast and it seems like they need to have a tall guy who serves apparently it seems like its an advantage Because Im guessing the the highest the ball the better you know with the foot when you serve Thats just what I can you know observe here So yeah let me know the comment section below your thoughts this literally blew my mind I think this is the most entertaining sports Compared to like you know like sports that requires a net you know so we can think of volleyball We can think of tennis and also volleyball or whatever that was you know that I read on Wikipedia or Or batminton you know this is the most entertaining in my opinion seriously Its so freaking cool So yeah Thank you so much for watching if you found value in this video do not hesitate to check out my other reaction

it I mean Ive been growing up with Kung Fu in Japan Kung Fu Hong Kong style is a very famous such as Bruce Lee Jacky Chen Chao Shinchi Especially Jacky Chen I was hes everybody know right Especially in my generation Hes a star everybody knows I remember when I watched his one of his films called Drunken Master I was literally shocked that his Kung Fu was fantastic and so strong and beautiful I dont know if that in this film he performs Drunken Kung Fu style You know he does Kung Fu but hes totally drunk so the enemy cant expect his movement and its beat so easily So I thought um you know drunk in Kung Fu style was the best the strongest at the time But now Im growing up and I think its impossible story But anyway I think many Japanese believe Kung Fu is the best martial art in the world and I was one of it But recently such my idea is changing Getting changing because I started to realize that Filipino martial art is better Ive reacted some video or telling about Filipino martial art to Kali It kills anybody its a killing method Its a structure is totally different from that of Kung Fu So it could be better than Kung Fu in terms of killing though But I want Kung Fu to be better because you know Kung Fu is our hope our hero you know what Im saying So thats why this video is like the finals to me you know like We decide which is the best which is the strongest martial art So you guys ready Now lets see the finals If you enjoy the content give it a thumbs up and consider subscribing if you hear So lets get into it Oh so this is Kung Fu right Oh this is Kali Oh Im excited now So I guess that two of them are mustearned', 'Well I realized one thing after watch this video There are many familiar movements for me in this Karam bit Which is the movement of judo or karate I remember that karate is originated from Kali Philippines martial art I think this Karam bit is one of Kali So thinking of which I think many famous modern martial art such as judo judo or kung fu are originated from Philippines martial art as well But what I think is totally different from is the purpose Karam bit as for Karam bit is to kill people you know what Im saying I feel every movement is supposed to give you critical damage Whereas Japanese martial art is not its literally art So its thought to be you know beauty is more important For me I dont want to kill people but I think this kind of martial art is so beautiful and cool So I think I should more learn about that', 'Eskreema versus Iado which martial art is better If you are familiar with martial arts then you would have heard about Eskreema and Iado These are two commonly known martial arts within the martial arts circle In this video well be exploring their history their primary objectives and conclude by giving our opinion on which of these two martial arts we believe is better Whats through to the end to find out what we think Im really impressed with the people who think about this situation this video Fantastic idea All right with that done lets get down to business Also known as Arnes or Kali Eskreema is the national martial art of the Philippines It is a martial art that is focused on the use of weapons and incorporates a range of them including sticks knives blades Oh that is Bruce Lee right Hes doing Kali as well So he took it into one of his martial arts Really Oh now Im really impressed with Kali more Wow I didnt know that He did weapons and other improvised weapons Despite its emphasis on weapons Eskreema involves open hand combat techniques as well I know this must have The origin of Eskreema can be traced back to a period of intense conflicts between several preHispanic Filipino tribes or kingdoms Some theories link the origin of Eskreema to India These theories insist that the martial art arrived at the Philippine islands thanks to travelers who came through Indonesia and Malaysia having picked up the ancient Indian martial art salam bomb I didnt know that So so Kali has been affected by many countries martial arts Indonesia India I know some of my subscribers insist that you know Kali is from Indonesia or some of his colleagues from Malaysia India I know Now I know what they are meaning On their way to the Philippines the more predominant narrative however is that Eskreema was practiced among the native Filipino people many of whom were commoners who lived in poverty The martial art was not known to be practiced amongst many of the societys elite and noble people Early records written by the first Spanish explorers to visit the Philippine islands indicate that a weaponbased martial art was widely practiced amongst the natives before their arrival Although direct links between this ancient martial art and modern Eskreema have not been well established many believe that the link exists Early Spanish records report that the first Spanish settlers fought native tribesmen armed with sticks and knives two prominent weapons of choice in the modern day Eskreema While the Philippines was eventually conquered by the Spanish it is unclear how much of an influence the Spanish rule had on Eskreema as a martial art but most historians agree that there was a considerable influence as is reflected in the name Eskreema After the Spanish colonized the Philippines a decree was made that prohibited civilians from carrying fullsized swords like the crease or the campalan This however did not stop practitioners of Eskreema as they found a way to keep the art alive by resorting to sticks made of retan in place of swords They also used small knives as weapons and wielded them like swords in combat So I guess Karambeads comes from this era as well Modern Eskreema combines the native fighting techniques of the Philippines with old Spanish fencing techniques and over time a degree of systematization has established this martial art as unique to the Philippines There is a culture of blade carrying in the Philippines implying that people in the Philippines are more So Cali taking many good things from the strong martial arts from every country and getting stronger and stronger and the God one of the strongest martial arts in the world now Wow that makes sense thats so strong Likely to carry a knife than a gun Although many of the people in the Philippines carry knives for their daytoday activities especially farmers and food vendors these knives which can be so easily concealed can also double as devastating combat weapons This culture is a reflection of the martial art style of the Philippines Students learning Eskreema are taught to fight with weapons from the onset and are only allowed to advance to empty hand training after they have mastered stick and knife techniques Many Eskreema systems begin by training students with two weapons which could be a pair of sticks or a combination of a stick and a wooden knife This method of combat trains the students to be ambidextrous as they are taught never to move both hands in the same direction Another feature of Eskreema called the live hand involves the use of a free hand to control trap or disarm the opponents weapon The free hand is also used to block attacks from the opponent or to execute simultaneous motions of the arm such as a technique called the bicep destruction The most notable weapons used in Eskreema are a range of sticks edged weapons including a variety of blades and other flexible weapons such as a sarong ikud latigo and tabak toyak all of which are different kinds of ropes Now to the Japanese martial art Iado Iado is a martial art that relies heavily on the use of the Japanese long sword called the katana The martial art focuses on the mastering of sword drawing techniques that are performed with smooth and efficient motion to devastating effect While Iado can be an aggressive martial art practitioners are trained to develop an imposing presence and a mental pressure that they use to dissuade an opponent as much as they can Mental is also really important for you Iado Until the only option left is to resort to the katana Nevertheless a key feature of this martial art is to train practitioners to be extremely alert and able to draw out their swords quickly to respond to sudden attacks In line with this Iado has four major components The first is the smooth and controlled movement involved in drawing your sword from its scabard This is followed by striking or cutting the opponent to inflict damage after which the blood on the blade is carefully removed and the sword is placed into its scabard All these ought to be done in smooth sweeping motions New students usually practice Iado using a wooden sword also known as a bokeh for safety reasons You didnt know that Otherwise they could use a blunt edge sword called Iato More experienced practitioners are however allowed to use a sharp edge sword and train it Wow Despite the history of Iado the hundreds of styles of swordmanship involved in this martial art subscribe to noncombative aims and purposes In many ways see this is what Im said some right X Yeah actually its filmed So if you guys have a chance you should watch it differently You can see the how strongly the Iado is As Iado is a reflection of the morals of the classical Japanese warrior and this martial art is ultimately seen as a means to develop a person in spiritual harmony who also possesses high intellect resolute will and sensitivity Thats so impossible movement though Thats so film I dont know what Im saying It is for this reason that Iado is often performed and practiced as a solo art Practitioners execute their style and form against one or more imaginary opponents and an activity known as Kata The nonfighting aspect of Iado means that its primary emphasis is on the precise controlled fluid motion executed by the practitioner Cool']"

when he earned his infamous nickname He made his boxing debut in March of when he was given the opportunity to match up against the English YouTuber Halal Ham Days before the fight Salt Papis opponent couldnt stop talking smack Oh my god that was so racist I think he intentionally wanted to be valiantly offensive offensive because he clearly knows hes Filipino and hes gonna send him back to China

Hes considered by many as a sports good greatest of all time And Getson City His dad was a bowling coach but he first fell in love with his sport of gold And he was even doing great competitively On one fateful rainy day young baeng forgot to bring his umbrella so he had to take shelter That shelter turned out to be a bowling alley From then on he changed his life But school and bowling That coaching by Angs potential was unleashed as he became a Filipino bowling prodigy and became the national champion only at age Damn Later he would join the bowling World Cup and upset everybody as he claimed that championship at years old Making him a record holder is again his book of world records as the youngest world champion ever Back day double and this footage is so freaking old How old is he now Most people thought he was a fluke until baeng came back four years later to bag another World Cup win year old Ang Nippon Mou Channel Strike Strike Bowling World Cup champion Ang Nippon Mou Channel from the Philippines He became famous for his accurate strikes despite having an awkward south ball bowling arm swing I just have a look at Nippon Mou Channel when he plays here It looks as

Lord is the only nation coach to have the USBC gold levels certification and continues to hone the skills of the younger generation He looks so good Just one of a kind because another phenom was also wrecking havoc in the different department The world of speed Oh boy Lydia Diai De Vega was born and raised in Mekawa in Bula Kahn In her childhood she rarely became the aide with playing tag with friends because she was just too fast This got the attention of the schools of athletic coaches so she got invited to train to compete in the sport of track and field Lydias dad was a cop so he was very strict with her so she kept her training in secret until her dad started noticing her getting tired for often which led to him finding out about it Her dad then gave her a condition that he would only allow her to compete if he coaches her himself Lydia agreed so not long after she started dominating the sport by winning her first two gold medals in the C Games in both the and meter dash This got her qualified to compete in the Asian Games This is where the big names compete including the favorite to win the event in just well known speed powerhouse PT Ushah But our hungry year old Lydia was unfazed by the pressure At first Lydia seems to be falling behind in the fifth place right before Ushah But on the meter markup go go go go go go go go go go go go Oh my gosh Its incredible Oh my gosh Your legs must be burning at the end of this But Ushah wasnt going down without a fight because next year the Asian Championships she would win the gold against Lydia Visually forming a rivalry between the two fastest women in Asia Their fans went back and forth about who really was the fastest but all the debate would be put to an end in Asian Games Oh Im having tears right now Boom Oh she won by a landslide By a landslide Easy man You need gold Ah But did she compete in the Olympics']"

next morning uh the guy wakes up in his hotel you know and he goes down to the exgirlfriends house again because you know I mean he he hadnt gotten that out of his system yet you know he wanted to spend more time with them He he did love the family you know just as he loved the exgirlfriend he loved the family too but this time you know he arrived there and he he asked about you know hows Grandpa doing You know he met the grandparents in the last visit and he liked them you know they were genuinely kind people they never asked for a dime People who have good intention rock okay And the grandparents were these kinds of people They were poor they didnt have anything never asked never even hinted at needing anything from this foreign guy But yeah so he had a lot of respect for these grandparents and its kind of like the less people ask the more you want to give its kind of that mentality but you know anyway he he asked where the grandparents were Because he was there at the house but he kind of forgot where it was as he you know he had to orientate himself again So you know he gets directions from the exgirlfriends parents of Where the grandparents are so its a five minute walk away So hes walking hes walking and hes on the way to grandparents house but he stops by some little shop he brings some pentacel bread which is like breakfast bread and some coffee okay Instant coffee okay no big deal pesos or whatever right Anyway so the grandparents live in the same house that they raised all of their kids in So its been you know years at the same house So with you know they had kids okay They had kids I think it was nine girls one its a real its a real female family Anyway so the grandkids were there theyre everywhere you know theres just kids everywhere Basically the grandparents have land They have this house on and the kids and the kids and whoever the kids of the grandparents who were never adults they sort of built you know makesshaped houses on this land next to the grandpas house okay You know little wooden houses next to the house So this guy arrives at the grandparents house with breakfast in hand okay And the people theyre so happy to see him again All these people the grandparents cousins whoever You know it was unplanned They had not seen the guy in years Some of them had never even met him on the first visit So he walks in the house and its typical Filipino style you know the extended family theyre just everywhere you know laying on the bed laying on the whatever you know but when he walked in when he walked in when this foreign guy walked in the house his intention was to see the grandparents again okay And he actually walked in there In reality he noticed a girl He noticed a girl Well this was a girl When he was first there a few years ago and he did meet her But this was a few years ago Shes turned into a young lady So this particular young lady who is a cousin of the exgirlfriend is now years old and her situation is like you know she has no parents and no real place to live This is her whole life since you know shes three years old Its the only life she knows But she basically just stayed with whomever would let her stay with them You know she would move from village to village from house to house For whatever reason I think the Anson uncles all kind of negotiated amongst themselves to take care of her for a certain amount of time each She had to move on because you know theyre all dirt poor You know and the girl was you know its another mouth to feed They got to you know have school expenses and whatnot I mean its just another expense to have her there But everyone kind of felt sorry for her', 'Although you know at first it did seem it was the exgirlfriend at the very beginning before the aunt bought a phone because she was very pissed about him buying her the phone The guy even told the exgirlfriend a day after the stealing accident like the guy said to the exgirlfriend Okay because theyre talking right what if I bought the year old a new phone okay and the exgirlfriend said Ill go to her house And Ill break it now obviously it was out of jealousy She did not like the guy buying her a phone So this made the guy realize like it must be the exgirlfriend but that was before the aunt bought a phone for her livein boyfriend things changed then So since the year old could not fathom the idea that her aunt or basically her her adopted mother took her phone The foreign guy insisted the timing was too coincidental to be a coincidence the year old was so offended due to that accusation and also ignoring the fact that in her mind the exgirlfriend definitely took it so the year old took the guy to stop talking to her She said stop talking to me and that was the end of that Relationship but there is another twist here folks A month after this stealing phone incident the year old messaged him again out of the blue there was a revelation Okay a revelation to the story so in the bag that was stolen there was this phone There was the girls phone but there was also some toy one of the cousins you know Rinky dinky toys I guess so it was a toy from one of the boy cousins okay so just as all the family is always in each others houses The boy was in this aunts house the boy who lost his toy and in the aunts house who lived about a five minute Took took right away the boy was in her house and he found his toy the same toy that was in the bag with the year old girls phone so the girl tells the guy the foreign guy that you know after the phone was stolen This aunt asked what was the password of her phone Okay and the year old thought nothing of it and told her told the aunt her password and that was the end of that So obviously this aunt took the phone why she took it I mean shes the most welloff person in the family due to her past boyfriends and her current LDR So this aunt had a foreign boyfriend who bought her a house okay that relationship ended right she had two babies with the Filipino guys Who are a policeman and an army man okay So she does have money coming in on top of that she has an LDR boyfriend who currently sends her pesos a month But anyway its kind of a mystery why the hell did she steal the phone and it must have been her as that toy was in the same bag as the phone was but anyway the boy who found his own toy he said that the aunt offered him pesos not to tell anyone He found the toy so the boy took the pesos but he was too young You know I mean hes in grade one or whatever he was too young to understand what you know what was going on So you know he returns home he returns home and he gives his mother this pesos that he was just given and the mom asked How did you get pesos and he told her exactly what happened So then it was pretty obvious what happened okay the aunt for whatever reason took this phone It was not the ex girlfriend it was not the aunt who this foreigner thought it was anyway Nobody is going to confront this particular aunt for two reasons and the guy asked her the guy asked why why not just confront her first The family depends on her for money you know during important times so they dont want to get on her bad side Okay so she has like a proper house with aircon so the family members often sleep there if its too hot or whatever You know she feeds them if theyre hungry etc Okay so the second reason is that as the foreign guy is told okay She is truly evil and vindictive and they fear her wrath Okay if she is accused of stealing the phone and again you know why steal the phone You know she has no reason to steal the phone even her youngest daughter who is four years old has a phone But for some reason it really seems like she took the phone anyway another month passed and the year old Then asked the guy this foreign dude if if he can buy her another phone the guy says why you know She says she needs it for her assignments you know Shes used to using her aunts phone but that phone broke Im not sure exactly why she needed a phone but I guess for you know research or whatever anyway The guy said to her the foreign guy said to her that you know you know I bought you some stuff because I liked you I liked you you know I liked you But you know we dont talk anymore Were sort of not really in each others lives anymore You know basically the guy washed his hands with the whole situation but there was some left out details from this story here folks', 'so the guys got to go he takes off He can only take this small village thing for so long But he keeps in touch with the girl via Facebook the year girl now the story takes a twistier folks okay So the guys gone The guys gone now the family takes a trip to the beach and You know the year old she brings her phone so the phone gets stolen here folks okay So as she left her bag with the aunt as she went swimming now Its only family together here at the beach folks So thats why this is a bit of a weird story So she finishes her swimming okay She finishes her swimming and returns to the beach and the phone is gone okay The phone is gone the she put the phone in a bag okay And the the bag was next to the aunt okay It was sort of the aunts bag okay The aunt didnt realize her bag was missing until they began to pack up to go Coinciding with the year old finishing her swim and coming out you know with her cousins to everyone whos leaving So they called them in from swimming so immediately the first culprit the first culprit of the stolen phone is the ex girlfriend of the guy Because the ex girlfriend also needed a phone and the guy bought a phone for the year old not the ex girlfriend So the ex girlfriend was kind of pissed so she became the culprit I mean talk about selfish this girl has a new boyfriend He should buy her a phone not the ex boyfriend but shes so selfish She expected a phone from the ex boyfriend anyway lets carry on her folks So the ex girlfriend is a culprit and the next culprit was the aunt okay And Ill tell you why a week after the stolen phone incident okay The aunt who was looking after the girls phone she bought a new phone for her boyfriend okay So word was getting around like where did she suddenly get enough money to buy a phone for her livein boyfriend As the livein boyfriend was a freaking fisherman who had no real salary the aunt just worked sort of freelance as a beautician doing manicures pedicures so she had no real income so suddenly she buys a phone for her livein boyfriend her excuse because she was questioned was that she borrowed the money to buy the phone and a lot of these Provinces people they do have easy access to loans and they like them because the monthly payback amount is Pretty low so anyway the year old told the foreign boyfriend that it couldnt be the aunt because she had always taken care of her More than the others you know like it was basically a mother daughter relationship between the two so it couldnt have been the aunt I mean she would not do her that way the aunt saw the year old as a daughter So it could not have been her could not have been the aunt who stole the phone besides that I mean the phone she got for her boyfriend was not the phone that the guy bought for the year old the phone was a different brand so the year old is telling to the foreign guy via messenger that you know It couldnt be her because it was a different brand the phone and the year old is trying to deflect the blame to the exgirlfriend She doesnt want the foreign guy to blame the aunt she wants to foreign guy to blame his exgirlfriend She took it as you know she did express her anger towards the phone being bought for the year old in the first place So the foreign guy says to the year old you know it must be the end Its got to be the end because what she must have done was she you know She wasnt stupid enough to just give her livein partner the phone she just stole instead You know she sold the phone that she just stole at the marketplace and bought him another phone And I mean for no other reason than the timing you got to think about the time it was one week after the year olds phone was stolen Okay now the fisherman the liban boyfriend here he had never had a phone in his years You know and then a week after the year old phone gets stolen the guy gets a new phone I mean come on line things up here folks the year old though was kind of angry at the guy You know the guy the foreign guy for not blaming the exgirlfriend not putting the blame where she thought it ought to be like She said you must still love your exgirlfriend and the guy is telling her to get into reality like it has to be the aunt']"

Yeah', 'So Im going to sign up from this video right now And well continue the crackers video tasting and bookbang and everything in another outfit Im really sorry But yeah I love it Thank you so much Chris My name is Champo Rado Oh my god I said this even when I was like eating Champo Rado You think its a good thing to eat Im going to eat it And I was like eating Champo Rado You think it is very similar to our rice porridge We call it keir If you can please try to eat keir because its also very delicious I love keir Both of the things again but our keir is usually made with milk and oil water Even in this one actually I did add a little bit of milk later on Not condensed milk I added milk just to thicken it up And I thought maybe we would love a flavor like that Thats why But I was really really good I did prefer it after I cooled it rather than eating it hard Because even keir I dont really like it But its really really hard I cooled it like no I cooled it and freezer Sometimes it looks like an ice cream Rice porridge ice cream And chocolate flavor I mean wow Brilliant So what happened is I even took my parents and my moms best friends reaction because it was Sunday And thats when I decided to make it So everybody can taste it And we can have like a no feast with another food as well So I was like Ill take the reaction of everyone And I did And it was so good And you know what I just tried to see what today And somehow the videos dont open anymore Only the two videos My eating video is there thankfully But I cant open the video when my dad and my mom and her best friend is eating and saying whatever they wanted to say about how they found the taste Im upset about it But probably I will post about this when I make another jump or other like the another packet And another packet as well Thank you so much for giving me in bunch because I really really loved it Im going to even try to like make my friends eat it Ive already told them when we have night stay away from top rather because they havent of course tasted it They werent here when I tried to make it So it would be great fun And you really really really love this If I had to pick both from both of these Ill say the crackers Im sorry But I really love this I always wanted to buy like such food and from Amazon pantry or something like that But the shipping and everything becomes very expensive I even tried like getting lucky mean rules since it has been I did promotes them I really wanted to taste it Especially the cheese one Oh my god But one small like not even this One small packet is like about a thousand rupees for me Thousand rupees converting I dont know But thousand rupees a small packet is just wait and without shipping that is Its without shipping So I like to curse step back as like I dont know if I can order or just probably work hard to go to full repeat that needed there Yeah But yeah I really really like I loved it Not right I loved it Thank you so much Okay Thank you so much for this And I will see you guys next time Bye bye Love you']"

subdivision area for jogging and sports They are using huge porous hydro coffee We didnt have time to have coffee at home so then have to do it on the side road We are with Benz on my car Yeah It Benz on walking pixel They are at least actually doing some kind of activity which this place is usually for but the real reason why we came here because finally I dedicated myself to learn driving Because as you can see in the vlogs we are always with our scooter during our adventures but its always only Jonathan who is driving Ive never learned how to drive Finally its going to be time for it I used to practice a little bit without our old scooter but that was many many years ago and I completely forgot everything We came to this empty subdivision now to practice but like I said coffee has to come first In the heat In the heat Nothing better than a hot cup of coffee in the heat Im already falling Not even on the scooter yet And then you have to hold up with the brake Holding With the brake With the brake okay And just lonely So many beginner accidents definitely just driving around heating misleading Thats amazing Thats amazing Thats how its going to be Yeah Youre holding on to the plane Yeah already heard so I need to rest it Next time Im driving Ill go to the pagu Benz on the shoutout Shoutout to Idayan Okay Jonathan and Benz on left me Now Im on my own for the first time So lets see how it goes Oops I turned But I think Im pretty good at this This could be like a month of luck guys Its always just awesome Im afraid Behind Jonathan being on the front of the scooter its so much more fun I will see how fast I can go Theres like a straight road ahead of me I wont like speed up of course It will be just an impressive speed for my beginner level Maybe I can reach like Lets see Oh what the hell miles toll drift Oh what the hell is that Okay Im going to be under my first drift Jonathan we ride Benz on motorcycle but Im warning you I already went with Ill go for it Come here Roman Wait Im a motoblager Oh That was fun It went a lot smoother than I expected I learned a lot quicker than I thought I would So that was a lot of fun but of course I still need to practice until Im ready to go to the road Yeah Im super happy that it went better than I thought', 'Also while eating I wanted to share a few toys about driving and traffic here because I always see this topic being discussed And actually there are a lot of foreigners asking for advice when they are coming here for a holiday If its dangerous to drive here if they will be fine renting a car or a scooter Or they better just stick to public transportation And me as a fresh one day old driver I can share some experience because even though I just started driving Im always a back ride behind Jonathan so I see quite a lot And of course everything here is very different And for example in Europe right in front theres a lot more vehicles on the road And theres less like street signs that would help you navigate Also there are of course many different type of public transportation That doesnt exist for example in Europe like the price because and the cheapness And you will of course need to pay attention on those and be aware because sometimes they like suddenly put it aside when they see potential customers for my ride So all of this you will need to pay attention to because like someone coming from Europe or other countries wont be used to this So it might be a challenge to drive but for me I dont think that I will have any type of problem since I never drive before back at home So this will be like the regular environment but I will learn driving So I think like this its not going to be that much of a challenge It might be challenging for those who are used to a different driving environment So for those who are coming from abroad you will need to see it first If you think it would be fine for you to drive here or no but I think I will be okay since this is the kind of environment that Im used to Im used to drive because motor cycles So Im really hoping that I wont face any special challenge driving here but later on when I will actually go to the road then I will be able to share more personal experience with you Also it depends on place you are planning to drive if its Manila or the province because just because there are more vehicles and less street signs it doesnt mean that there are no traffic rules Actually in Manila its a lot more strict And there are many roads thats why even us dont really drive around in Manila Usually we prefer to use public transportation In provinces and islands its less strict and also less traffic So I think anyone who knows how to drive would be fine A lot of foreigners are renting scooters to get around You will just need to be aware of people overtaking and people walking on the side of the road but you should be fine', 'A quick change later we are in the grab It is pouring down the rain has come I have had to pour an extra umbrella because I think my rain coat yesterday But we are off to the diplomat hotel which is one of like five places in Baguio City is going to be haunted So this hotel was abandoned like years ago when the owner passed away and it just wasnt kept up afterwards It used to be a vacation home years ago and during the war there was some executions that took place here It is pretty creepy Even people are nonswexacuted here There has been rumors and stories of things of the supernatural occurring so we better watch out for them We have even gone inside yet and I am already

activity to do if it is raining in Baguio and we are about to go in There is other people here now It is a bit of a tourist attraction I am nervous And we are in This place is creepy as It has got like all pictures and stuff on the wall There is a lot of plants so you can tell people do come here now and then to keep what is dark Keep the plants in that intact but there are so many rooms in all the windows open It is crazy Perfect Perfect It is down this corridor We have got like a little fountain here As you can see all the way around the windows have all been taken out It is just decaying It is just wasting away You all want to see what is in here There is like snail marks down there It is like people have scratched it It is so creepy It is creepy as you can see the views outside Back into the city Now that is creepy You can dress up as a nuns Use the occupiers building I dont know if I want to do That is really really creepy The downstairs is so so eerie I think we are going to go up the top now We are trying to find some stairs to get up there We are upstairs now It is even eerie up here There is actually a story of these windows here or the windows that look out The locals have seen people walking past the windows with no head How would you do it How Oh my god I dont really want to bump into them Now this is really scary It has just got RIP Loads There are different peoples names on it I do not want to be added to that list This hotel must have been huge as well You can see how many rooms there were along here We are now up on the roof As you can see you can see out all over the place I am not going to go out next It is raining and I left my umbrella downstairs The views from up here are ridiculous It gets eerie all the bathrooms The bathrooms creep me out The bath tub The bath tub There is a bath tub and it is on its own You think about the fact that someone should be using it and not it is just a roofing It is really creepy I think that is it from up here You can get amazing views if the weather is nice I want to get the drone here because you can see it over the city Obviously with the rain we could not have backed down the hill and found a taxi

Most of the Philippines Is just a dead spot Anyway for any type of service And one thing I think this thing can improve on Is the battery life To be honest Im not very happy with the battery life on this But it does come in handy when I need it So Pretty cool I had the same company provide a device When I was in the States And that battery life was great It lasted a few days But this one only

recall too much here It just seems a little bit disrespectful but you have to just come up off the path and theres little ones dotted about everywhere This isnt a very well known one but if you look around you can find them Were now at our second little hike to the Lumyang cave its only about minute walk from the road side and yeah the views are incredible again These pine trees yeah all these

people in the village used to come here and they will gather around this area and just hang out to use internet Thats kind of fun though like instead of going to like a city cafe just you can gather in the pretty green fields and have a beautiful view of using the internet You can even pull out commot if I have to Yes you can even harvest commot Sounds fun to me There are more commot fields there So he said people will harvest it put it in a sack carry it on their back and then hike the whole way around the mountain and then come back again for another sec Guys imagine how proud we are of ourselves to complete a hike and then Im locating here just doing hikes with a huge sack of commot On like regular basis Multiple times Yes Wow they must be a lot more fit than me Some of these

Theres a picture of me of these like stepping stones which makes rice terraces And it was the Ifugou tribe which hundreds and hundreds of years ago the Ifugou tribe had made it by hand Thats really the men and women were out there like carving these rice terraces And today just so beautiful I mean I was flying my drone and getting the most epic shots In my opinion this should be like one of the seven wonders of the world It is that outstanding I agree I was actually super super surprised when I met the Ifugou because they were able to speak English Like its so unreal And I asked why they are able to speak English They told me that the missionaries came to that area and told them English And so thats why they are able to talk to tourists as well After the Benawai rice terraces From Fakhtpudnalik Which is a province just north of Manila and it is famous for none other than its sissy Its really capital I only went to Aling Sossings All right the sissy has arrived Yep Look at that Oh my god Anthony Bodin went there This is a link plate of pork snout As you hear All the parts of the paper you dont eat normally They chop it up put it on this sissy plate with onions and its just fantastic And it originates in this city And actually the great Anthony Bodin who is my role model and idol said that this is the most underrated dish in the Philippines Im just probably going to take the world by storm Mmm Wow Its definitely the best sissy Ive ever had Woo Its fantastic bro I dont know how to say that Not to mention this is a thing Something that I admire about the Philippines is that every part of the animal is being used for some sort of dish So in this case as he said you have the nose you have the eyes you have knuckles I dont know like all sorts of pieces that are combined in a dish that is really delicious Its very heavy But if you have enough rice with it it should be fine Good day Ana Roa and Pat Sissy This is the best']"

here about eight years in the first two years maybe the first three years is on a tourist visa I went to immigration I tried to do an annual report and they said no Im not required So if youre on a tourist visa you dont have to do just pretty much everybody else If youre A if youre a work visa SRB more of a permanent visa you have to do an annual report And that basically is just a one form thing you fill out right Very simple to fill out Your name address correct That type of thing Yes correct Rod The Bureau of Immigration is always striving to make it easier especially since last year they have actually extended to some Robinsons malls to they congest their Bureau of Immigration offices especially in the main office Because theres a lot of foreigners that have been issued with the visa and its also very practical also or to ease off of doing the compliance of the annual report And then again I totally admire the Bureau of Immigration right now because they have been doing their best really to ease up the process itself So thats a good thing So they might be having a different set of requirements this year like before you go there you need to set an appointment you need to fill this out Theyre going towards being online already and that would be a good thing for you guys to do your annual report especially for those who are really far from the Bureau of Immigration or having some difficulties on their mobility to go to the Bureau of Immigration So there are any instances that you would need to help just let us know and well be figuring out which would be the best option for you']"

whole thing as well With the apartheid With the apartheid So you know its crazy And so we started hiding We were told that there was basically a man in government who was an antiSemite And who was very antagonistic towards the Jews Okay quick break So just a quick throwback to my childhood I knew this was going to happen So one day my mom told us that we have to leave the house and she basically just packed pictures of my childhood all necessary documents And she told me that we have to leave And we had to separate from my dad And I had no idea what was going on So being a child when this all happens is really tough I had no idea what was happening We take the train home and very often there were kids waiting for us older kids as we came out of the train station And they started running after us eight kids and throwing stones at us and calling us dirty Jews So I became a very fast runner In a group of Nazis came to the door with a German shepherd and wanted to see about the Jewish books And my dad had quite a library The dog frightened me Territ was a big police dog And they took the books There were a fair number amount of Jews living in that apartment And how they took all these books to the backyard of the apartment building And there was a whole pile that was built and basically burned all those books Intense Quick break So for us it wasnt books For us it was our house So the house where I grew up was burnt down and there was no way back So my mom and I made our way to the how does it train station And I think this part will also be in this video So Im going to save it for that part But yeah its tough when memories get burnt They took my German citizenship away from my mother my father and myself So now we were stateless My dad was arrested and was arrested in the Breslau Town Hall My mother told me that told my brother and I that my dad was away on a trip on a business trip But really never divulged that he had been arrested And but cried bitterly We couldnt understand why she was crying My father was told by the Nazis that he had to sell get rid of all his houses He could only take marks out With the implementation of the Nuremberg laws and depriving all German Jews of their German citizenship this that enabled then the government to confiscate businesses to confiscate homes to appropriate all their assets It was not a physical extermination but it was a social annihilation because it annihilated their place in the social fabric of German society and treated them as nongratis as foreign enemies living amongst society Okay so I think we learned about this since its cool In Austria you actually learn about the worldwide and all the Nazi history which is really important And the part where she said that that got taken away or arrested I had the same experience My dad was actually hiding from the so just the background story Im from Bosnia and we had civil war which it was the former Yugoslavia and then the Serbs started attacking Bosnia and yeah And yeah my dad was hiding actually from the Serbs so he can survive We had to separate because we couldnt go as a family together and then he got captured in one of the socalled concentration camps And he never talked about that Never And it was really something that I wasnt aware of So yeah Thats better a similar story of who mom My fathers family left Germany in so it was late and in fact my fathers uncle Walter with him he was very close was actually taken by the Nazis and killed in a concentration camp They were welleducated German Jews who believed that this

or not be treated by Jewish physicians anymore And then my father realized that time is up and he should better start looking around for another country to take him Its crazy that this was backed up

are Theres lots of dairy I dont know if its called dairy but theres lots of like different branches of Christianity But so you know like back home you would like we grew up in a Catholic high school and all that stuff a secondary school of your forbidden But there were lots of other friends of us that used to go to like the Catholic same same school as us But they were like evangelical Christians or they were like there was there was a bunch of other branches They all did just stuff differently in the way even the way they would look at the congregation and like the mass and stuff like that And music seemed to be a bigger deal in some branches more than others Like in Catholicism the Catholic church you obviously have the choir which is a bit similar to this Yeah the Roman Catholic Roman Catholic church But in other churches perhaps that are a bit more modern in their approach to things they have more bands and they have more like alternative influences Even Jellic the evangelical Christians here No theyre the ones I can always remember because my father had a genomic office and in some of the bottom floors they would hire our events spaces and stuff And there was this evangelical Christian church or event thing They would always have fucking some music and stuff and they would be braving essentially They would do it In the glory of God Yeah yeah they would do it for quite a long time Obviously not to enough is ours because what the fuck But they would hire those events those places And then we would remember like you know say my father was working in the

of vegetables there and the prices were really good Yes theyre a lot cheaper and fresh Yeah and distance wise for us to go from here to Duma Gedi or here to Zamburgita in time its the same time but theres just no traffic out that way No traffic at all Yeah the road is four lanes wide and its just clear sailing all the way there So we went back with the scooter and we picked up vegetables So we think were going to go back every two weeks to get our vegetables right Yes its definitely worth it Its definitely worth it So we had a good time So we also noticed they had a lot of garden utensils there So its got of a funny story We wanted to get what we call in the US a hoe HOE and Wilma kept saying I dont think they call it a hoe So I said that I was going to do a thumbnail for this video to say my search for a hoe but Wilma said I wasnt allowed to do it So we went down to Zamburgita and I didnt see any but I was asking a few of the vendors there And all they are is little bamboo huts that they just bring their goods to and they had bowlows and different machetes and things like that So I didnt see any hoe So Im trying to explain to like three different vendors because she kept saying dont say the word hoe So Im saying a garden utensil its shaped like this and you strike down to the dirt And then finally one of the ladies says oh youre looking for a hoe So we found out that they do call that garden utensil a hoe We did find it and we bought it So it works real nice I wont show that today on the update Something small but we had fun with it because you kept saying dont say the word And its very hard to try to explain that you want to buy something when you cant use the actual word of the item But its real nice and we already used it down at the garden and when we show you how the garden is doing well show you our purchase']"

Miguel Corporation We all remember that time Because we know thats San Miguel Brewery Secondly they had also gone on to acquire the Bank of Commerce which led the corporation to enter the banking industry Despite being in the middle of a global recession San Miguel Corporation continued to acquire major companies and strived hard to see a continued change in business dynamics In a shocking event would however unfold Ramon Ang which was now years old is looking to retire In an interview with the Wall Street Journal Ramon Ang said that Ive always planned to stop working and enjoy my time when Im The Wall Street Journal is for you Ramon Ang for his role in National Foods in which they use some of those proceeds to acquire stakes in Pitchron Corporation and Manila Electric Corporation Unfortunately two years have passed by and Ramon Ang does not seem to have retired He would go on to experience the biggest breakthrough of his career In he led the company to stage big investments They had announced a billion dollar merger and acquisition spray and so after bought Philippine Airlines they had also Thats insane Thats insane and through its conglomerate status led them to enter the infrastructure business But that was not the big breakthrough of Mr Ang After he led the company into growth he went on to acquire a stake for himself Yes at that point Ramon Ang was just acting as somewhat of a leader of the San Miguel Corporation He was not the owner of the company Neither was he even a major shareholder But by he swooped in and bought of San Miguel which was million shares priced at about pesos each for a total of about million pesos And as time showed neither his retirement nor his small would stay the same He would go on to Imagine having that money to just buy As a topranked shareholder For that Wow He holds about of San Miguel as of the time of this writing One could now understand just how Ramon Ang went from being a normal businessman in the Philippines to taking San Miguel Corporation in his hands', 'Yes San Miguel Corporation we know that he is one million corporate leaders out there But what we need to understand is how how did he get to where he is Thats what Im asking myself as well We need to understand the letter he had gone into and the actions he had taken led San Miguel Corporation to where it is today We can trace where Mr Ang first started where he first appeared on the board of directors for San Miguel in when he was at the age of many had assumed that he was merely the chairmans glorified executive assistant Who was at the time known as bending coancho who recently took over Andre Sorianos chair Nothing was known about Mr Ang he had no business affiliation stated in the companys annual report and was all but a close friend of Coancho son yet upon an interesting Coancho he had praised Ang for Impressively turning around his cement manufacturing firm and was described by Coancho as a successful businessman Upon appointment as the And was noted by San Miguel executives as the one who had already been running San Miguels daytoday operations and to whom the companys president was reporting I mean imagine running a business bad big and being the chief operating officer Its just its crazy to me Ive been a chief operating officer but in my own company Nothing like corporate company and that was already just for so Kudos to you His stage as the already elected vice chairman Ang was not just like some business men out there He was already very wealthy an old source in by the far Eastern economic review of Hong Kong estimated that he was worth at least not bad at all and much of his wealth came directly from his heavy equipment business Importation and property a year later as the dawn of the st century Ramon Ang is seen to be strategizing the future of San Miguel Corporation On January it was reported that he was finding investors for a possible billion pesos for a climate plan somewhere in Roxas Boulevard one of his potential investors was the famed Hong Kong billionaire Lee Kaxin but that very project would stumble upon challenges leading to a supreme court battle by San Miguel would yet again come into rocky roads the government was still against the entire chairmanship of Mr Kohanko and there were fears that if the government took the stake in the company He and Ang would step down Fortunately I didnt know that the government has stake in San Miguel Corporation That is very new to me at least but that explains a lot happen by Ramon Ang would be named the official president of San Miguel But as some have noted he was already running the daytoday Corporation and the title was nothing but a formalization in the same year Ramon Ang was seen taking up a big stake in Phil Webb Which was equivalent to about of the company Phil Webb was a big company mostly operating in the casino industry', 'Some of the most notable feeds about Ramon Ang are not specifically about his daytoday operations But rather how he helped the corporation target its goals to enable expansion by acquisitions and new facilities He took a small stake in Phil Webb but in San Miguel Corporations view He was there when the company had eyeed local and international expansion in Ang and San Miguel announced a two billion pesos bottling facility plant for one of its alcoholic beverages known as Junibrasi He named Bra around Batangas It was also reported by Financial Times London that San Miguel has been looking to Asia for its next rapid revenue growth The news magazine in an interview with Mr Clonco stated that he was hoping that San Miguel would increase its presence around Southeast Asia including China and Taiwan to allow What a second I thought that San Miguel was already really close Despite the Philippine economy being sluggish By San Miguel had announced a production facility in Malaysia that would target the local country and also Singapore The Johor Baru facility as stated by Mr Ang would enable San Miguel to lower its cost of business And that plan was to acquire a hectare property in a greenfield project A year prior however in Guren Beverages company a Japanese conglomerate had acquired a stake in San Miguel Which was reported to be good for the country and for the economy Finally one of the last few major acquisitions done in was when San Miguel acquired a Malaysian packaging firm Which Mr Ang has cited that they had confidence in Malaysia for its probusiness policies By San Miguel Corporation was now rocking the entire Philippines market Their sales revenue totalled billion pesos in And billion by And is now looking to target billion pesos How are they going to do it Well Ang had led San Miguel in the acquisition of a major Australian company Which it bought for a whopping billion US National Foods their acquired company was a leading company in the entire food and beverages industry But Ang has stated that he was a very expensive acquisition Which led them to consider selling at least of the company to minimize cash outlay But surprisingly they did not sell of the company But rather of the company took care of the Japanese shareholder of San Miguel for a price tag of over billion In just two short years Lets go profit San Miguel profit more than a billion dollars Even when they held the company as a subsidiary it was already making profits for the parent company National Foods contributed billion pesos or million Australian dollars with million pesos in operating income from billion And an official million

girls Theres three beautiful girls sitting there and they go hi sir its dark and its on the beach And they go hi sir can I take a picture with you And Im like they wanted me to take a picture of them three No they wanted to take a picture with me And this has happened to me more than once in Burakai Im not sure I dont think they recognize me from my channels since I dont really show my face much and my channel wasnt very big when I used to But no youre an American or youre a Western guy or youre white Philippines are going to approach you of all ages and ask for a picture like your Drake or something So anyways we got to talking and basically what happened was they told me they were like taking a liking to me or the one of them was really taking a liking to me Oh wow sir I really like you I want American boyfriend like you or I want Western guy like you And Im like do you like me And Im like well I dont know I just met you like minutes ago or something So I sat there and chatted with them And there was a little bit of a communication barrier and they were translating or texting me or while were sitting together or speaking to each other into God log which guys you need to learn to God log when you come out here So you can know if theyre talking smack about you or your girlfriend is when you get in a relationship or whatever These people are very close Youre going to be mainly probably friendly or hanging out with their sisters and them and different people and stuff So you want to make sure that you know their language so that you can kind of hold your own But anyways just hanging out with these girls is sitting there just bullshit and they say oh were and or whatever And Im like look at how Im going And I dont know let me see some ID And they keep going oh my God I want boyfriend like you We can come to your house with you and all kinds of stuff And Im like yeah seems a little too easy And I really know reason for three of you to come over since Filipinas arent like that if you know what Im saying Or that type of party and seven I was kind of thinking why would I need these girls to know where I live And theyre staying at a hotel out here Theyre not from Baraka Theyre from few hours away or whatever And were just talking just bullshit or communicating the best that we can which is a little bit rough because they are having a hard time understanding and speaking English They kind of speak it good but theyre claiming theyre having a hard time doing it So then theyre texting me', 'Its written me out though how the people really received me Right When I came in here to the Philippines are you a secullo new Youre a secull Ah hi secull Look at me Im like this Bro do I look like secullo new to you Maybe wait wait wait wait wait

Let me show you the Feeam Let me show you the side of you Okay get it out here get it out here get it out here get it out here No But yeah yeah yeah they thought I was secullo They asked me in my basketball player whatever When I tell them that Im former military Im a former Marine you know retired disabled Thats when they say oh okay military Okay so thats where the arms and the chest and the body and all that comes from Okay okay then they understand Im just glad that they received me in a positive way Filipinos I noticed they try to see the good in a person from the beginning right Its many things that still even after almost five years surprised me about the Philippines You know what Im saying That Im still learning Im still learning How about the typhoon yes The typhoons you said Yeah thank you The typhoons Typhoon matter of fact lets talk about typhoon season Woo Shit I aint never seen that much rain in my life okay I mean wow The Philippines yes is prone for typhoons Thats something else for all of my people that are coming out here Especially people that want to come out here and live Just know there is an actual typhoon season You got to make sure that you always watch the weather watch weather reports stay abreast of whats going on Okay and I heard it from firsthand experience Debye from my girl you know She went through a very very terrible typhoon in What was that typhoon called Queenie Typhoons in Dome right It got very bad their house flooded totally washed out to where she was on the roof of her house for hours Okay thats how serious typhoons are here in the Philippines So its very very serious guys to stay abreast of the weather developments that are going on in your area so that if you do live in an area thats lower know thats near a river or something like that you can get out of there as quick as you can right The Philippines is a beautiful place to live but youve got to remember its in the middle of the ocean You know it has its turbulent times it goes through a lot of weather anomalies that people that are coming from the western world or you know whatever you might not be used to it So Im telling you now Im teaching you right now you know That these are the things you got to get ready for right Typhoon season is serious rainy season is serious You know what Im saying Until I got used to it I used to say when we go through rainy season its raining again Its raining what the hell is raining for Babe its rainy season its going to be like this for a few months All right check were going to house Right You got to get used to it man And some days on rainy season its serious rain Im talking about rain that comes from the side and smacks you in your face like this Damn shit You got to hold your umbrella like this

last video warning me of Lesbluslamotis and whatever you call it Because I was totally unaware and for all we know we just prevented a lot of pain for me So thank you guys so much Appreciate it If you enjoyed this video dont forget to like it subscribe to my channel and hit the bell And then my dear friends my dear saviors I shall see you guys in the next episode Peace out Take it easy', 'What else can I say Medical medical for you all these and you young ones as well if you get into any accidents If you have insurance youll be okay Some of you would have seen the video where I got sick I dont have insurance I had to go to a hospital Its generally inexpensive If I paid like stayed in hospital all day had to get hooked up to an IV to report them medications It cost me like including the ambulance to go to the hospital So really cheap like medical care I wouldnt worry too much about it As most of you are going to have insurance And of course the medical care is good As you know Filipino nurses are everywhere worldwide They all speak English very well So you will have no problems here with medical care So I suppose that is a pro Another thing I just want to like emphasize as well Many people really think the Philippines is dirtgy And guys it is if you live like a Filipino like I said before But most Westerners that are coming here theyre not going to want to eat in current areas every day Lets just be honest Theyre going to want some home comforts So when youre going to go to these restaurants and such the price is a lot more than like in other places in Asia For me for example Ive had in restaurants in Vietnam Its a hell of a lot cheaper than here in the Philippines So if youre the kind of person who doesnt like to cook and likes to eat every day you have to take this into consideration too But like I said before if you come into the Philippines for the food its probably better to not', 'Health insurance we pay pesos per year for the two of us for emergency health insurance So we get an accident have a heart attack or anything like that And it is a zero deductible one I have a whole episode also on health insurance here in the Philippines where we interview one of the brokers Hes a Canadian the expat that came over here married to Filipina and now works here And so he has great knowledge from both sides what it was like in Canada what it was like here that kind of thing Very informative Anyhow so it doesnt take care of day to day if you just need to go into the doctors that we have pick hash for that But all emergencies all the scary stuff where you might need a million pesos or something like that Thats all covered no deductible Medications I am going to leave that to the end because it has nothing to do with making a budget for normal people The average person ours is absolutely crazy and it just happened this month But well put that at the end so that we can like have the tag line out the words Our miscellaneous so that could be haircuts it could be clothing those type of things Im lucky My wife loves Uki Uki which is like going to thrift stores in the America and Canada And so she can go there I can give her a thousand pesos or something and shell just go to town to come back with items I dont buy a lot of stuff so Im like most men I dont have a million of everything And Im the only one that seems to get haircuts Shes only had one haircuts shes been in the Philippines Her hair is nice and long beautiful But when she does go well it is a lot more money for a female to get a haircut than a man of course But we have budgeted of pesos for that miscellaneous of those couple items there And that is the budget minus those medications Ive mentioned']"

and beating people Being real good at his craft But I did not know the story His story Im hoping that Casual will teach us a little bit more about Efrens past What age five His dad brought him along to Manila to have a better income to support them If it was a shy kid growing up and struggled to interact with kids his age so instead of playing outside he worked as a spotter and a janitor at his uncles billiards hog He made it his home as he played billiards all day and slipped on the pool table every night This is when he started gambling at the very young age He was so young that he was too short to reach the pool table so he would stack some coke cases just to make some of his shots What He got the nickname Batta to distinguish him from an older Efren Im sorry but just this information makes me want to watch a biopic movie about Efren Seriously it would be such a great movie in my opinion Also played pool in their home As Efren continued playing he kept rapidly improving until he beat every player in their home So at age his uncle started bringing him along to bigger money matches The movie was very popular at the time so gambling at different pool halls was a thing Efren was beating everybody There was a time when he went to Clark Airbase to literally farm dollars from American soldiers And because of this his name had become a terror in pool halls and he started running out of opponents So his income from gambling started to run dry Oh my god Thats right He went right back into playing billiards In Efren started planning a trip to the US to play against American pool players But an American sports writer apparently have been taking notice of him while he was beating everybody This writer went back to the US and informed their best pool players that a new threat is emerging His name is Efren Reyes Because of this the Americans were able to scout him and found out about his reputation So this ruined Efrens plan to hustle American players for money For those who are confused hustling is kind of similar to smurfing in video games Its like a mythic player playing in the Grandmaster Rank in Mobile Legends to farm easy wins In Efrens case he wanted to farm wins which translate into dollars to support his family In order to counter that obstacle he decided to take on an alias Cesar Morales Why did you say that Morales Billiard Hall after Billiard Hall He left the trail of destruction leaving a opponent demoralized Its not going what he did Like I swear His story almost sounds like a backstory of an opianemasonse whos like a joke But when an action transforms into some kind of forbidden folklore beast Anyway his hustling days continued in the s until he discovered the big money tournaments He entered under his alias and went on to win his first ever tournament as Cesar Morales How was he though But when he was asked to sign one of those autographs he accidentally exposed his identity because he subconsciously wrote his real name Because of this his hustling days were over so he focused on playing and dominating tournaments under his real name And weve heard the nickname the magician because of his aggressive style of play and shot selections that know what even the greatest pool players dared to attempt especially in high pressure situations Ive been Ive been watching the movie Im attempting those shots is one thing Youve got to have balls I have to do that I enjoy playing pool a lot or Billiard That looked like a looking shot but Like this one Effron was just a bystander and some younger professional players playing pool were taking too long in planning their next shot so they handed over the Q stick to Effron They had no idea that Effron already saw the shot from a mile away He did it with his bag on his back and a hanky on his hand Here are more examples Incredible Incredible Incredible He is He is our son Oh my god Yo the math Oh stop it Oh stop it Oh stop it Oh stop it Oh stop it Oh stop it Oh stop it Oh stop it Oh stop it Oh stop it Oh my god Aside from these amazing shots Effron is also the author of the greatest shot in pool history He was playing against one of the greatest pool players at the time Earl Strickland The match was very close as they were tied at brags each in a race to match Whoever wins the rack becomes the champion Strickland did the break to pocket the two balls They attempted to pull off a safety play hiding the one ball behind the seven and eight ball but emailed to do so So Effron took advantage He then handled business as usual Oh because he had these shots go to the end But not until the five ball became the object ball Little bit Just a little bit I said What neednt you have to do that You see what Im talking about No thats right Now why did he do that He got himself with the trouble because the six ball was slightly blocking it But instead of doing a safety play no the five balls No the five balls No the five balls No the five balls No the five balls Oh my goodness Stricklands all my effort ball An impressive shot for sure But this wasnt the greatest shot I was talking about The shot has gotten him into an even bigger trouble Oh yeah And this is the object ball All three other balls are blocking every option Effron had So attempting a safety play let alone hitting the object ball was virtually impossible But despite the predicament Effron ever proceeded to leave his mark by pulling off the greatest shot And the greatest shot ever made in the history of billions The iconic the shot No the sensation when you pull a shot like that must be incredible Effron didnt even have the chance to finish the rack because his legendary shot obliterated all the hope that was left in Stricklands body as he proceeded And then he went to the red there shortly after that What do you have to do What a finish This got Effron His third straight championship win in the Sands Regency Open So liifying his case as one of the greatest pool players to have ever lived I wonder if its a lucrative sport He remained humble while some opponents would flex on him Im breaking the balls very well So thats good for me Ive been playing pool years I feel like Im playing perfect I feel good I feel very comfortable Just looks like a oneman shot You know thats why this game is the toughest game on the planet It usually just responds with humility Well Ive been here recently You know I dont know if Im playing good or if Im playing bad I need luck to play And then it was easy to keep this opponent a high quality billiard seminar Yeah you like this so far Its pretty good over that section And after embarrassing them It usually just say this iconic line Wow thats very humble Goat pretty simple touch To have won the WPA World Championships in two different pool disciplines namely ball and ball A fourtime SANS Regency Champion a time Derby City Classic Champion and a twotime World Champion with a Spartaner Jago Bustamante To this day he has earned the respect to not just his countrymen See its so freaking worthy of a movie because he basically came from nothing to this to greatness the goat Yo gotta make a movie about this man']"

went by it rained pretty hard for about one hour straight And you can see that were starting to see some blue skies and now we can see the blue the ocean a little bit So again typical rainy season clouds up midday Look at the pool So it rained one hour one hour real hard and its about an inch from overflowing So we got I would say three inches of rain in minutes Its just about overflowing So Im going to go ahead and backwash the pool So take a look I think we did okay So nothing washed away Everything looks dry The cardboard definitely helped But the paint was dry anyway So no fears of the washing away or at least we didnt think so So this is the first coat You can see the steps are a little wet But thats all going to dry out over time Remember all the rain that was up here Not too long ago Look how its already dry So the concrete dries very very fast The steps here will be dry here in a little bit as long as we get no more rain The forecast shows no more rain for today And chanceshowers midday tomorrow So again basically a carbon copy of today which is probably what its going to be for the next several months So bottom line is it looks like tomorrow morning I will be getting up again at am and coming out here and trying to get the second coat on before the midday rain', 'And definitely the wet weather is here Yes definitely The rainy season is upon us So whats happening is and what were finding out is in the mornings its usually pretty nice And then around midday early afternoon it clouds up Very similar to what I call Florida weather Showers mid afternoon like you did here this morning about noon right around noon We got a shower And now it looks like its starting to brighten up out there I see some blue sky Youll see the update as I get outside here in a minute Its still cloudy but in and out clouds And then probably get another shower this afternoon I guess thats all part of the rainy season So what were trying to do is get our patio or two meter overhang in the patio around a pool painted with that gray weatherproof UV protected paint that you guys saw that we purchased We have five gallons of it We want to get going So I said to Wilma today hey I want to clean the screens and all the tracks for all the glass panels because every couple of weeks it gets filled up with bugs and things like that So we went ahead and got started And Wilma had a great idea We just clean all the windows So four hours later we did get all the glass in front of the house completely cleaned And believe it or not it wasnt that dirty We cleaned them real good when we moved in a couple of months ago So were probably going to have to get in a routine of every two months doing a real thorough cleaning Yeah And they look really nice I mean they were somewhat dirty but the screens were dirtier So the screens were probably going to have to do every couple of weeks But we spent about four hours this morning get the front of the house looking squeaky clean', 'So lets get out to the front of the house and show you guys some updates All right The rainy season is here But last couple of days not too bad It was blue skies most of the day today The clouds are just starting to roll in a little bit And I took a couple of photos earlier today of how the ocean looked And again always live is so much better than a photo So its a nice view here but I just want to show you quickly what Oppo Ireland looked like just a couple of hours ago And that was the first time that the ocean looked like that Right now its just look like a blue gray But earlier today it was all streaked all the way from here all the way across with blue and gray and blue and gray I dont know if that salt water coming in at a different level of salt I just dont know but it was all streaked And you know I caught my eye So I took a couple photos And Im probably going to have to get a better camera because you guys know I used my Samsung phone to do videos It was just absolutely amazing So this is holding up real good the patio paint Really holding up nice Were so happy we did it Remember guys were going to do another coat here because its a little streaky Its not bad It looks I think it looks good but we did buy another gallon So were going to go ahead and do another coat on this And we could have done it today But we just was goofing off and went for a ride in the truck I wanted to show you I have the pool pump off Typically when I show you videos the pool pump is on And that gives you know a little bit of a ripple into the water Just look at the clarity of the water Thats at six foot deep right there So see the mosaic tile I mean if you threw one peso down there you could see it This water is just so easy A lot of people ask about it And on our livestream they asked about how much maintenance is it Weve been lucky Its no maintenance I run the pump two three hours a day Like I said before and I put a chlorine in it twice a week And I put about six to eight ounces And its just it stays very very clear And then a few people said if you get a lot of rain which we have lately itll throw off the pH And the pH hasnt moved from the day we put the water in it every time I test it So one of the things I think I mentioned shortly is Wilma had to peel off the coating that we put here You can see the difference from here to here This cured the waterproofer the sealer the clear sealer Just with all the rain it just would not cure And then it started to bubble a little bit So just like you know if you got real white skin and you get a real bad sunburn like I have many times in my lifetime and your skin peels off thats exactly how this came off So we got most of it off And then I got in here with the power washer and it took the rest of it off So this is just raw concrete just like the driveway You can see its a little wet here because I washed the truck today Thats the cleanest truck in Dallin I clean it like every day because now we dont have a lot of projects So what Im going to do is Im going to give the camera to Wilma And Im just going to show you because this is a Wilma suggestion for the Kubo And I think its a great idea because you can see this is our ocean view right here all the way across So if we put a Kubo here it would only be blocking If I go straight onto it it would be out this way So wed be blocking views this way and this is our neighbors home over there being built Not a bad idea right And then even if we go up to the car port or if I jump up on our two meter overhang right it would be right about here where the Kubo roof would be Its like say were my hand this way Wouldnt block any view at all even at the corner of the house here So this area would definitely work And then when I was also thinking there is electric run to this column right here coming down the column is electric So what I could do is on this side is come across and come down and would have to be patched of course and repainted I could run conduit here in the dirt down to the middle and come up into the Kubo and have electric in the Kubo And it wouldnt cost much to do because its really easy to run in the dirt So again theres electric right here So Im going to turn the camera over to the boss and then shes going to allow me to show how big this Kubo is in the area that were thinking about putting it']"

on the TV network It is With all these popular and stars and stuff but this has been requested so often and weve seen fellow creators check it out and stuff and they were like you have to check it It is great And the funny thing is you know we used to do this when we were children and Im sure if youve been following the podcast and stuff some of the stories like you know how it is sometimes and how long this was probably done remotely Id imagine because of the whole restrictions that I dont know Because based on our conversations with other Filipina creators that work on TV they have set how TV broadcasters have been following closely the regulations the safety regulations for the situation and so they probably they could have filmed it in studio So just following I doubt it because sometimes those crowds are so big you know because its like theyre everyone But okay maybe they dont have any of the big crowds in this one Maybe they just have remote you know like separate studios and like separate takes A shame because I hope they do have the people because its one of the thats the fun aspect of that recording of the year Its true is that the big panoramic take of the whole staff that works in the in the program No Im prox to all these TV networks for not stopping doing this type of stuff because you know they had a great excuse to not do it and its prox to all of them you know its definitely helped a lot of singers right now in the industry and stuff and because gigs have stopped concerts have stopped so Yeah Its pretty amazing though I love that stuff', 'Pero

sweet and I like his energy you know its something that you cant explain really like his energy I like the quality of his videos I like how he interacts with people and I like the quality of his audio you know Im big on audio and he we could hear him very well so thats a big plus for me So yeah and I think this social experiment is a lot of fun its also funny you know and it just shows Filipino

You dont know whats old No we dont want this Dont write next time Even in other areas they actually slashed it down to half size of a letter size band paper So its good Theyre trimming down And probably they just need to make the fonts a little bit bigger because it depends on who is doing the extension That could be a good point of view that they would be taking a look at right now For

beautiful Shes so good And still the worst No need to say this Shes so good Actually shes my Ideals I really like some house sexy I like some out cute I really like her Actually I met Lisa before Because I was the extra In my ex and wife And I have a picture Also on my Instagram And a lot of people Theyre so good Im just kidding Among the six Filipino celebrities featured Who you consider as your ideal type Or who fits your personal preferences Or Catherine my ideal type I dont mind the best skin color Jane she has a right energy Compared to other celebrities that you showed to me Most of them were like serious And then kind of looks scary sharp eyes Like this But she has like kind of soft mood KThan Wow I knew it Yes Lisa is also so pretty Thats why I had a hard time choosing between Lisa and Catherine But I chose KThan because She doesnt look that far For me as a Korean So she is matching to the Korean beauty style I chose Lisa because I really like her Cool feeling Because these kind of people Tato you I really like her style Catherine Bridalgo Because my personal preferences Looks like puppy something like cute Lisa shes also cute Like shes more an adult sex She really got her own taste Actually for me I really like her Of course I really like her But Catherine I like simple ones I think Catherine is more on Korean style And I heard her makeup artist Tatyata or Naya Because this makeup is also gorgeous So pretty Her eyebrows are not too dark And her hair Yes The Philippines The matte Because even the shade of the eyebrow But I think its better for me Among the six who would fit the generally accepted South Korean standard of beauty best and why Lisa Lisa or Jane Lisa is more idol type When I ask my Korean friends They mostly say that Lisa is the most beautiful girl in the Philippines She can learn to have a role in the Korean movie Not on drama But on movies and dramas Drama should be looked friendly In our real life Movie can be from the brain features Lisa I already answered this right Yeah thats the reason why I chose KFIN She is the one who fits best in the Korean beauty standard Mameindosa Actually in Korea even though they had plastic surges before or not The entertainers there are a lot of pretty girls Their appearance is I think confined to beauty of Asian So I think Mameindosa Different beauty For Korean standards Yes right In Korean standards Jane is more of a firstgeneration Like their first song of Christian Yeah thats right Cheongcheon Now that youve seen these Filipino celebrities What do you think are the ideal standards of beauty among Filipinos Big eyes big eyes Kind of curved eyes from the silk hair Long hair I think its personal Mediocre What Youre Korean First and foremost I noticed that their skins are all good So I think thats kind of a similarity with the Korean standard of beauty I dont know if Elle showed us so many variety They all have the distinct charming points So hard to summarize into one Because everyone showed different attractive points Even though the Filipino is located in the Southeast Asian part They have been influenced by so many western countries Like America and even from the Spanish I think their ideal standards of beauty is with big eyes I think the eyes is the most important Like looks deep could be tan or could be white tan Long hair I dont know why Long street hairs Also sometimes the big wig Yes theyre the big ones They prefer the long wig Big and long wig Because in Korea theyre all good The first love of the Korean brand is long hair Long hair Im not sure about skin But this one is in the Philippines Not in the Philippines But theyre all good Theyre all good Because the Korean brand is all good Theyre all good Theyre all good Theyre all good Korean idols The Korean brand is all good']"
