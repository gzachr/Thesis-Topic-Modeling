- [JP] Previously on HealthyJunkFood,
we made it to the Philippines!
(techno music)
(record scratch)
Okay we showed you too much.
Let's back it up a little bit.
(high-pitched whirring)
Previously on HealthyJunkFood,
we made it to the Philippines.
Where we started our food
journey off adventurous.
Trying a hearty porridge called
lugaw with egg and laman,
or intestine,
fresh coconut water,
inutak which is a sticky
glutenous rice dessert with ube
and of course the infamous balut.
All of our cultural food adventures
will be on our second channel JP & Julia.
So when you're done watching this video,
go head over there for 36
hours and watch everything.
(beeping)
Okay now it's the evening day two
and just like any good
relationship compromise is key.
Which is why JP,
which is me,
needed some Wendy's
but Julia had one rule.
- You can't get any food that
Wendy's has in the States.
- [JP] Lucky for me,
that ended up being a lot of food.
So yay.
It is now day three
and we're headed off to
the the Mall of Asia.
And I'm ready for McDonald's.
(upbeat music)
- [Julia] We made it to McDonald's!
And it's the morning.
- [JP] You know the rules guys,
we can only order stuff
that isn't in the US.
- Thumbs this video up.
- [JP] A bowl full of happiness?
We'll get that fry thing later.
- [Julia] Yeah.
That'll be in a different video.
- [JP] People here are awesome.
- I love Filipino people.
Literally I want you to come to my house
so I can feed you.
- [JP] And they let us film.
- Yeah.
And no one said no yet.
- [Police Officer] Excuse me.
No video.
Picture only.
- [JP] Picture only?
- [Julia] Okay.
- Okay.
(beeping)
That was stressful.
But we did it.
- Right when we were saying
that everyone just lets us film,
then we get like,
caught up taking to the popo.
- [JP] Yeah.
- They were really kind though.
They said it's fine that
we film our own food.
- I also wanted to point out
that we saw a lot of McDonald's
delivery drivers around
and thought that was really cool.
Breakfast at four in the morning,
that's amazing.
We're just gonna randomly
grab one thing at a time.
- I randomly grabbed this.
(gasps)
- Dude is that fried chicken?
(gasps)
- [Julia] Yep.
I hope it's spicy.
And they serve gravy on the inside.
- [JP] Dude butter's better
when it's in the shape of a flower.
- [Julia] Let's just get that butter.
You're welcome America.
Oh no.
- [JP] Gotta get your nails cut.
- [Julia] Ow.
- [JP] Yes yes!
(laughs)
Now throw the chicken on top.
- [Julia] Now the dish is complete.
- [JP] All right.
- Yum.
I can tell it's good.
- Yum.
- By your saliva.
It's gorgeous,
it's everything.
- [JP] McDonald's doesn't
even have fried chicken,
on the bone in the States.
- No they don't,
they only have fried chicken patties.
- [JP] This beats any
McDonald's I've been to.
- [Julia] It's juicier,
it's crispier it's just better.
You're sweating too much.
- No I'm not.
I've never had fried chicken
this good in my life.
- Let's go on to the next dish.
We have the cheesy eggdesal.
(laughs)
Okay,
want a napkin?
- Yeah.
- Okay.
I don't think anything else is spicy,
so you're lucky.
All right the cheesy eggdesal
is most obviously a sandwich.
And what I'm noticing right away,
is that this bread is
different in the States.
- Eggdesal is a made-up
word by McDonald's,
deriving from pandesal,
a common bread-roll in the Philippines.
It's soft fluffy sweet and delicious.
Folded egg,
ham and cheese.
Even their folded egg's different.
- Oh yeah they put cheese
in the inside of the fold.
- Oh yeah oh!
(romantic music)
- That looks good.
- It's way better.
Cheese inside the folded egg.
Come on Micky d's in the US.
- Yum.
- Okay I'm definitely,
am very very very very impressed.
- [Julia] I gotta have a bite.
- Everything here's been so good.
I think McDonald's is like
their number one rated thing here.
- It is.
It's the top rated fast-food
joint in the Philippines.
- It's better than the muffin,
better than a bagel,
better than a biscuit.
- Why are they putting cheese
on top of a folded egg in the US?
Stick it inside.
(screaming)
- Winner winner egg cheese omelet.
- Breakfast.
- Breakfast dinner
(laughs)
- Next.
We have a bowl of happiness.
And I guess this is a new item.
- It's a omelet.
- And there's mushroom in there.
You can kinda see the little mushroomy.
And it's served on top of rice.
Can you see that?
See the rice?
And it looks like,
almost like another folded
egg but more omeletty.
It reminds me of Hawaiian
food a little bit.
Like a loco moco?
- [JP] Mm hmm.
- I like it.
- Still sweating.
Oh yeah okay,
that's good.
- I hope we're not offending anyone.
- No rice and gravy,
- Rice gravy.
- yep instantly better.
Rice not my thing for breakfast,
but I get it it's a cultural thing.
- Yes.
- [JP] Let's go onto the next thing.
- Okay onto the next.
Here's another thing.
- Yay.
- What do we got here JP?
- Oh that's the ala king sauce.
- [Julia] What we have here
is the chicken filet ala king,
with rice and egg.
- [JP] Lift that up.
- [Julia] Look at this egg.
- [JP] That's a chicken filet.
And then this is the sauce.
- [Julia] The ala king sauce.
- [JP] It's like a sweet gravy.
- Ah!
Look at it it's a little rice packet.
Oh it looks like they might
season it with something too,
they put something in that
rice to make it better.
- What?
- What's in there?
- I don't know bite it.
Garlic.
- Garlic.
That's what it is it's the garlic rice.
Someone told me,
that you have to try garlic
rice in the Philippines
and we're doing it on accident.
I feel so good about it.
- [JP] Garlic rice.
Also known as sinangag.
It's basically garlic fried rice.
Usually paired with tocino,
longganisa,
tapa,
spam.
It's very good I suggest you try it.
- By the way guys.
Thank you for all your requests.
(happy music)
- [JP] Is that how you do it?
- I don't know.
What came first JP?
The chicken or the egg?
- They came together.
Have you ever got those Lipton meals?
- No I don't know what that is.
It sounds like a medicine.
- It tastes like a Lipton meal.
Throw it on the screen.
That's what that sauce is.
- I'll have to try that one day.
- The fried chicken
definitely beats the filet.
But this kinda works together.
- Why'd we get a chicken sandwich?
I thought that'd be lunch.
- I just wanna apologize,
we bought that chicken
sandwich by mistake.
Wow,
does it look like the chicken sandwich
at McDonald's in US?
No it does not.
- [Julia] It looks like
a chicken sandwich.
- [JP] All right go bite it.
- I think I know what
this is gonna taste like
and I know I'm gonna like it.
- It needs lettuce.
- If I could order a chicken sandwich
for breakfast in the US you know I would.
- What kind of degenerate
eats a chicken sandwich for breakfast?
- Me.
- Next.
Another sandwich.
I don't know what this is
but we're about to find out.
- Wait.
- It looks like a desal.
- I thought we already had that?
- Yeah but this one's different,
this one comes with that longganisa.
We learned later that longganisa,
is a sweet Filipino sausage.
And longgadesal is just a combination
of longganisa and pandesal.
It's basically like a sausage
with some spicy sauce on it.
That looks like a burger that
doesn't look like sausage.
- I don't know it's a little suspect.
I would go for the other sandwich.
But I do like this bun.
It's a little sweet,
it's definitely not
like the one in the US.
- Sweet sausage.
Again everything we're trying
here is going to be different,
hence the video.
- Except for one thing.
- What one thing?
No don't show 'em that.
(laughs)
(paper crinkling)
they weren't supposed to know about it.
(laughs)
You got it. (laughs)
It's all over her hand look at that.
You did a good job.
I'm full but we do have one more thing.
- One more.
- [JP] So we think this
is also longganisa,
just in a different shape.
- [Julia] I wonder if it's sweet?
- [JP] It might be sweet,
because I think it's the
same as the longgadesal.
- [Julia] Break me off a piece of that.
- [JP] That's a meat bar.
- Yep it smells the same as
the thing on the sandwich.
- [JP] Yes.
And that's how you eat it guys.
We just made that up.
(upbeat music)
- [Julia] It's impossible
to eat it like that.
(laughs)
Thanks JP for messing with me.
We already know what all
these ingredients taste like.
It's just about how you like it.
How do you like to eat your breakfast?
Do you like rice or do you like bread?
Would you rather eat a sandwich,
or would you rather grab a
fork and go at your food?
I prefer this.
- It's like oddly sweet.
- It makes sense though.
Filipino food is really sweet,
like the spaghetti is a sweet sauce.
- Yeah.
- You know what I mean?
Let's each grab our favorite thing
and have another bite
while we do an outro.
- I already know what my favorite one is.
- [Julia] The ham and egg cheese sandwich?
- Yeah.
It was so good I didn't
need like sauce with it.
Like I just ate it the way it was.
- I really like having rice for breakfast.
But I think my top pick is gonna be,
chicken and pancakes.
I don't know what lunch is gonna be like.
But you guys are gonna have to stay tuned
for another episode of HealthyJunkFood.
And join us for our lunch
experience in the Philippines.
- Mainly because we can't eat
all that food in one sitting.
- [Julia] No we have to go
for like a really long walk.
Right now we actually
are at the Mall of Asia.
Which is a huge mall.
- This might be a bold statement.
But I think McDonald's in the Philippines,
is the best McDonald's
we've tried internationally.
- It might be too soon to say,
'cause we still have to try at lunch.
You gotta like comment and subscribe,
because that's what we do.
We make videos about fast food places
all around the world.
- And we're gonna do it more.
- I'm jealous of that bite.
No sharing?
- Yeah.
- Oh relationships.
- It's really good.
- I just like holding a bowl
of happiness in my hands.
- Oh my god.
- I'm sorry I can't stop eating it.
All right,
take this away from me.
(upbeat music)
Okay give it back.
- Okay.
- Yum.
All right guys.
Bye
(upbeat music)
- [JP] Ain't this the
awesomest thing ever?
They have like a hand-washing
station right here
and you don't have to go into a bathroom.
- [Julia] I love it,
'cause I don't have to go to the bathroom,
I just need to wash my hands.
- [JP] ASMR.
(hand-washing noises)
(laughs)
- [Julia] You wanna wash your hands too?
- [JP] Ah no.
