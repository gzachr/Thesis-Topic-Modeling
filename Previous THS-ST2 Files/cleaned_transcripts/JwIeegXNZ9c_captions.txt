this morning we woke up in boracay to start our 
journey to cebu our bags were packed in a bus  
to get to the boats and then we all climbed 
onto a speed boat to take us to the mainland  
we waved goodbye to boracay island we all jumped 
into a bus to get to the airport then we checked  
in our bags and we had about an hour until we 
started to board our plane so we got a coffee and  
i started editing some videos for you to watch 
then we got on a bus and drove to our airplane  
we then boarded the airplane we took our seats 
and we got ready to take off and ready to arrive  
we are here in cebu hi thank you bye hi thank 
you wow that's so cool we're here oh it's warm
just got here we're just heading down now 
to collect our bags pretty easy flight less  
probably than an hour less than an hour we are 
so hungry we haven't eaten yet but first bags
so we're just in the airport now it's actually 
a pretty cool airport it's a lot bigger than  
the one we just came from that's for sure but 
now we're just finding a way to get picked up  
either from probably from grab apparently this 
is like a big city i don't know much about cebu
so our grab just dropped us off at the front of 
our hotel we're staying in the prime something  
we're just trying to find it at the moment but 
there's so much going on this is so much busier  
and bigger than i kind of like expected at all 
um it took ages to get here and i thought it  
was quite a small city but it's not i think 
we're right under this starbucks or near this  
starbucks or something too but it's really 
busy here there's a lot going on there's  
street vendor stalls on the side of the road 
over there it's really cool so far good vibes  
this is cute i like this this one's a cute room 
okay so we just checked in here at prime view  
suites and honestly it's really cute i really like 
it the bathroom's really cute the tiles are cute i  
like the hexagonal marble type thing when we're 
checking in she told us that they're like brand  
new i think they're like a month or so old and 
it looks really new it feels really new the only  
thing is that the rooms on the like level that you 
come up to anyway come off the lobby but i'm still  
sitting in the room and i can't hear anyone out 
in the lobby anyway so i don't think that's a bad  
thing and then obviously there's like the levels 
above that but this is cute it's new it's fresh  
i like it it was kind of cheap we got it online at 
about 50 australian dollars a night we're here for  
three nights and so far i really really like it 
so that's a plus that's a big plus and it's right  
in front of like starbucks like four other coffee 
shops it feels like it's in the middle of things  
so but i don't know that yet so when we go out 
shortly i'll let you know if that's the case but  
i really like this one so the most requested thing 
we've been told to do is try electrons so we're  
here at ayers electron we're gonna try it for the 
first time i've never had it before let's go in  
and let's see what all the fuss is about let's 
go okay so as soon as we entered we saw them  
like chop up all the roasts before looked really 
nice we ordered our glitch on we asked them sort  
of what they recommend as well this one so i still 
feel it we got that and we came upstairs it's big  
it's open air it's loud we're right on the road 
we can see cars going past you probably can't  
even hear me that well there's music going over 
there it is a vibe out here that's for sure cebu  
sounds and feels really lively right now straight 
off the bat we've got the plate of what we ordered  
not much of the meat but apparently that's because 
it's really expensive so you're not going to get a  
whole bunch obviously you would have to pay for 
more plus we only got a serving for one person  
and we're just gonna share it but there's a whole 
lot of rice that's the probably biggest portion  
of rice i've ever seen in my life not only that 
but it comes with achara which is like fermented  
papaya it looks like yellow noodles or yellow 
worms and a little bit of like gravy type stuff as  
well so cebu apparently has the best lachon there 
is okay so i grabbed a whole chunk of the pork  
on the lechon and a whole piece of the skin 
it looks so crispy it looks like crackling  
but different that looks delicious if you ask me 
i am a thief of crackling at christmas time so oh
i don't know if you heard that crunch that's so 
crunchy that is that is delicious oh the flavor  
in my mouth is so nice the pork itself 
like the meat is so soft but the skin  
is like crackling it's salty it's crunchy it's 
flavorful it's really good like really good  
like really good got the skin and the meat 
together that tastes significantly better  
than i thought it would i think that is delicious 
no matter what country you come from or whatever  
food you've eaten before let's try some fermented 
papaya yeah oh i smell it it's like very like  
soury let's try it all together there's a lot 
going on maybe too much of it i definitely  
think you're only meant to have a sliver or 
two and i had about 25 but i think i prefer  
it without because i can taste like all of the 
pork i'm not someone to add sauce and things to  
my dishes usually so i generally just always 
get the full taste of what something's like i  
just like the pork i think the pork stills 
show i think the electron is just delicious  
and apparently different places that you 
go in the philippines have different spices  
different flavors like it changes just 
a little bit depending on where you go
mmm it's spicy like almost so flavorful it's 
overwhelming so you just put a little bit of  
the sauce with more rice more plain rice and 
a little bit of the pork just so i can try  
the sauce oh there's i don't like that 
really i don't like that it's like a sour  
spicy taste which are two things i don't like i'm 
not a fan of the sauce tell me in the comments are  
you playing latron or you source electron because 
i'm not enjoying that sauce so just for reference  
the electron was 144 pesos filipina pesos with 
two coke cereals included in that but right now  
we're going to go check out fort st pedro and 
then also a couple other historical sites maybe  
some markets as well for our first day in cebu is 
it cebu or cebu cebu or cebu i'll probably switch  
between saying the two tell me what it is in the 
comments below i'm sorry i saw people say one  
or the other so it's not my fault tell me what 
tell me the right way in the comments let's go
so we took a grab across cebu city basically and 
ended up in a part of cb we've never actually been  
in yet obviously it's the first time we've been 
to cebu but it is a lot different to where we've  
dropped our stuff and started unpacking our things 
so this site is called magellan's cross it's marks  
the site where over 500 years ago christianity 
basically started here in the philippines  
so the cross that you see inside this big 
structure was actually where they used to do  
like the first baptisms and everything like that 
as well i'm not an expert on this subject by any  
means it's very windy right now please leave in 
the comments below any additional information that  
you have um that you know as you know my channel 
is about discovering things for the first time so  
i might not get the information completely 
correct but i'm always up to learning about  
it so let me know in the comments anything else 
that you know about it but from what i know as  
well is that the cross in the middle has actually 
been coated with something because back in the day  
over time people have been like this place is so 
sacred and they've been taking bits of the cross  
off over the last however many amount of years so 
they coded it so that they couldn't be cut off and  
they couldn't be taken away from the original site 
um and then apparently the big structure was made  
around it maybe like 50 or something years later 
after that so i'm reading the plaque that has a  
little bit of information about it and it's saying 
that the king and the queen of cebu and their sons  
and daughters with 800 other people were the first 
people to be baptized so there are a lot a lot of  
candles here around the outside of the plaque i'm 
assuming that's like an offering um let me know if  
that's not correct in the comments but everyone 
seems to be like praying as they put one down  
this chick is the best she's a little girl and 
she's on the hustle everyone wants photos here so  
she's like getting everyone's photos and she like 
takes pretty good photos everyone's taking her and  
asking her to take all their photos she's on the 
hustle and then obviously for an exchange of a  
couple of pesos and whatnot and she's like stand 
here she's like you stand there she's like saying  
on the line on the line i've noticed in cebu 
there's a lot of a lot more sort of street vegas  
than there was in manila and obviously that's 
gonna happen all over everywhere in the world  
there's that sort of stuff happening but like 
this is the first time i've sort of seen someone  
kind of on like a really cool hustle she's doing 
a good job awesome little entrepreneur over here  
so we've just walked literally next to where 
that structure was and then we're in the thing  
called the basilica what have you just learned 
they built the church here because they found a  
an imagery of like baby jesus basically oh they 
tend to look at that as a sacred site so this is  
a sacred site because that's why they found it it 
says that the church was knocked down and rebuilt  
several times over the years as well which is 
pretty cool and it's always been in the same site
so walking away from the magellan's cross 
on the basilica back there right now  
and we're just heading on the way to the san 
pedro saint peter we're on the way there now
so this plaza has changed names and everything 
over the time that it's been like taken by  
different nationalities and different kinds of 
people but it's now called the plaza interdepencia  
independencia which means obviously 
it represents the independence  
the philippines now have and the freedom from 
um the colonization that they went through at  
the very end of this and it's just closed 
we can still get a look at the first oh no  
they've just closed oh no we didn't just close 
the doors we'll see if it's a good floor maybe  
we can get inside anyway perfect okay let's go 
have a quick look because it did just close we  
watched it we want to get to carbon market okay 
but first we're gonna go check out the fort
so i tried to go in but they were closed so 
unfortunately we just missed it for today but  
it's beautiful here there's people there's 
kids running around out the front there's  
people sitting on this grass like a picnic there's 
greenery there's trees there's hedges it's just  
really cool here i'm getting like a really cool 
vibe so we're gonna go and try ahead now to a  
market um i think we might get a grab there or 
walk i'm not sure how far it is um but so far  
i am like a little bit intimidated with cebu um 
mostly just the uh like people on the side of the  
road and things like that but i i think that's 
just you know i can see that there's a massive  
charm about this place as well and i think that's 
why everyone says to come here and everyone says  
to have a look because you can see why it's so 
special um but it is a little bit intimidating  
in some points i will say that just being honest i 
think the more we discover the sea the more we'll  
love it i really like it more in the last three 
hours than i have yeah when we first got here  
as well it's awesome i go this way and we walk 
about 500 meters and we'll get to carbon market
it is so lively through here but there's so 
many people here there's lots of obviously  
things to buy on this side um but we're just on 
the way walking through to the market this is cool  
it's so lively i just can't get over 
it a little bit later in the day  
it's feeling like there's lots of beeping 
there's lots of life there's lots of people  
lots of bikes around here there's 
just a lot going on in this part hi

that is so cute this is insane there is so many  
fruits so many vegetables so many people this is 
crazy so many bikes there's a lot of we've missed  
we just walked through the whole thing i don't 
know what we're getting at this point i'm not sure  
it's a little bit overwhelming i think it's like 
a lot of markets we've seen other southeast asian  
countries where you have like a main street that 
was probably the original market and it's just  
expanded coming off that yeah so i don't know 
what we'll find on what areas it looks like a  
lot of fresh fruit and vegetables fresh produce 
which most markets tend to be and then things  
are built from there this is like the most i've 
had lots of reactions in the philippines oh yeah  
the most this is the most every like second person 
wants to be in the vlog which is awesome it's  
so cool in australia even you would never get 
that no you know what in australia people just go  
oh people be like you're lame for vlogging 
and they're so cool here this is awesome so  
let's keep walking through i'm not sure 
if we'll find any food or anything but  
this has been a great experience regardless 
whether we found food or not this has been awesome  
we might be a bit too late for street food maybe 
it's a lunchtime thing it's about five o'clock now  
i love all the puppies if i could like pat them 
all and keep them all i definitely would hi  
ninety percent of my life is reminding 
jersey that street dogs sometimes have  
diseases and you can't pat and kiss 
them all yes i can oh here's another one
hello my friend hi
all right that was houses upon houses up there 
they all built up and it looked like they were  
overlooking the water the other way looked like 
it was in prime real estate oh yeah yeah okay
all right pressure pressure
oh you're better than me
they're better than you they're so cool
that was awesome michael is obsessed with 
basketball and the fact that he just missed two  
of them he's like really pretty was smaller okay 
okay excuses i can't believe you're just walking  
down the street and now i can't play basketball 
that is the best a guy tried to hand me his baby  
i didn't want to hold anyone i was gonna say he's 
not gonna he probably wouldn't trust him with that  
this is insane there's people 
everywhere there's cars everywhere  
look at all that there's chopping up food over 
there wow this is crazy sorry sorry hi let's see
what is it what's that
smells like fishy maybe tuna i'm not sure tell 
me what that is in the comments if you know  
so these stores
this is the cutest thing so there's a whole 
bunch of stalls and stands a lot with shoes  
there's heaps of shoes those look like like almost 
used soccer shoes but obviously they're selling  
maybe they are used perfect and then you've got 
like flip flops croc looking things there's a  
whole bunch of jeans down here there's sports 
bras over here there is i have never seen this  
many people this is i did not expect this 
to happen today that's all puppies so this  
is like the section of used clothes so much like 
op shops or goodwill in america these are called  
uk uk or uk uk what that means is where 
that comes from is a lot of this stuff  
is donated from like google stores in the uk 
and america and the us so uk uk store what me  
the united kingdom the uk uk uk that's where 
all this stuff comes from it's all used clothes
you look you look happy
hello how
if anything it feels more it feels more 
juicy i actually like this one better  
because i don't really like fizzy drinks 
normally i like this one it's like more  
like flat like juice like water i like this one 
so as you can see lovely people and we just had  
such a good experience but just like traveling 
in any other country in any country in all of  
the world just keep your bits about you and just 
watch your things as well but we had nothing but  
a good experience and obviously a fun one as you 
saw the filipinos here are the perfect mix of  
friendly and outgoing that's for sure just like me 
so that's probably why i feel like i fit in here  
they even bring me out of my shell and i'm an 
introvert yeah everyone's so outgoing and so  
friendly happy to jump in for anything happy to 
say hello it is a really friendly and welcoming  
and inviting culture i found so if you liked this
