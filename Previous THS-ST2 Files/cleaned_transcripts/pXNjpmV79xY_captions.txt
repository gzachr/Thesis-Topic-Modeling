all right okay so I wanted to say
you
alright guys here I am again this time I just 
have beanbag ads this is the seashore here in  
Mendota daily activities once again is where 
the boat comes in all the kids at the village  
come bring the fish for they daily rations 
the fish as you can see they have a very  
ingenious way of a boat anchor if you 
can see down here what they do is they  
cut down a big ginormous coconut tree then 
they tie two or three of them together in  
this way it forms as an anchor for the boat 
that goes out on a daily basis very crafty  
if you ask me but hey this is another day 
and this is how to do it in the Philippines
I'm going to show you guys a way 
that they deal with the rations  
of their families will get none so it has a scale
if anyone can translate that for me comments are 
welcome I'm pretty sure she's talking about the  
fish alright so the locals here speak Bisaya 
in Tagalog as well so I don't speak for saya  
so I said but Visayan allow this iron he loud 
that's me yes that all so once again what they  
do is that they ration the fish and divide it 
among those who don't have and they'll sell it  
or share or barter but they'll do whatever 
is necessary to make it very easy for the  
community once again this is like a community 
this is the Philippines guys this is how we do  
it for long whooping this is your this is your 
mom they have family here is wrong any problem  
Mei here Wow so see everyone here is family guys 
it's a very wonderful affair it's early in the  
morning sister clock and the family is here 
dividing up the fish house-by-house wonderful  
thing wonderful affair alright I'll walk a 
little further and investigate we have some  
concrete that's broken down from many storms that 
come around this big tree that fell down coconut  
tree let me give you the look of a coconut tree 
here you see these ridges within the treaties  
are man-made bridges what they do is that they 
will use a machete and cut foot portions where  
they can use their feet bare feet so coat to walk 
up the actual coconut tree to pick coconut trees  
to pick to pick coconuts so very ingenious of 
the Islanders here in the Philippines guys very  
ingenious alright here comes some of the ruins 
let me investigate further alright manga name  
Umaga Naga Naga Marcella hot all right so we got 
some room buildings got some concrete it's pretty  
sad that there's tsunamis and the type beans 
will be this concrete as well but I think this  
is an abandoned home let's see if I can get up 
there without hurting myself ie very dangerous
all right it's a wonderful view we got leftover 
expired food just sitting there we got a home  
that's essentially destroyed inside cinder 
concrete just broken down there goes the  
boat with all the long yoke local young kids got 
a didn't let the fish on a daily basis all right  
watch out here before I hurt myself as you can 
see this was a stove that they used to wash dishes  
and cook on inside there's still some furniture 
in there and some hung up clothes but it seems  
like it's essentially abandoned from whenever 
the typhoon hit this is how it is guys but just  
leave it and go hopefully no one died in this 
particular storm many bikes trikes motorcycles  
all around and bendin building once again as 
you can see it's always a combination of brick  
and then leaves from the palm leaves and then 
wood and then sheet metal all different types  
of objects use to keep a home intact throughout 
the years I give it up to these people they're  
very they're very strong they pretty much they 
don't give up regardless of how the situation  
is always watch out don't bite the black guy 
don't fight the black guy I'm just a foreigner  
here guys London on oh my god all right gotta 
watch my back make sure these doggies don't bite
this is your behind are you getting fish today no 
is that no he's done a yarn bucket but I mean is  
that a lot of fish okay can I can I check your 
behind can I can I see all right JC invades the  
Filipino house all right so this is your basura 
all right so you see there's many Spanish words  
used here we have some alcohol that was here from 
before and put our board all right let's see what  
do we have this is your earbud bag yours rubato 
okay this is this is your kid well she's just  
looking off into the shore let's not bother 
her so we have the kitchen here is that on  
the kitchen right now bad fish it's the same fish 
that we saw earlier and then we have a couple of  
beds I guess we'll be double that baby all right 
made it complete wood I think that's pretty cool  
we got a radio in the back and we have some boat 
for some lines to catch the boat juice all right  
I'm gonna go ahead and go around good morning 
so they use this for water collection and for  
washing dishes more fish right here unfortunately 
I don't have any to give them and if I did I would  
definitely give them so maybe if I have time 
I'll come back before I leave today and give  
them some pistols just for a long intimidate 
their space like this so one extra spot that a  
raincoat you had just more lines for the boat 
so I guess the the mail here or whoever lives  
here boating big-time but that's how it is 
here guys this is where they do pretty much  
all of their daily activities motorcycle that's 
exactly what I'll do for them being so nice and  
kind and allowing me to raid their home I will 
come back before I leave I'll even run down here  
make a quick job and I'll give them some pesos I 
don't know how much I'll give them but I do have  
some pistols to give so I'll definitely give 
it well this is just the outside you can see  
how small their house is right under the tree 
it's it's sad that it seems as if the hurricane  
or typhoon as they call it came will definitely 
build us this thing down but you know Lord be  
with them hopefully nothing goes wrong nothing 
bad happens to them and I hope they are able  
to be safe especially with a small baby inside 
all right here goes the boat just like I expect  
the male that looks here so I'm just gonna let 
them know Monica marker after that I'll be back  
where I'll see them again and then I'll keep 
that promise here goes their boat this is the  
Mario Mario alright so I'm sure they have some 
fish in there boom ah gah alright guys I'm sure  
ting may not understand what I'm saying in the 
Terminator sense but I'll be back okay I'll be  
back I'll see you again okay hung hung inside 
Malik okay hung homily I mean it alright have  
a nice think I'm gonna head out bye guys alright 
good day for them I will be back a little later  
all right back again yes I really felt that 
I should probably dump that family so what  
go back to the house and currently staying at 
and see if I have any leftover vessels to give  
that family that allowed me to raid their home 
so I'll be there in a few so what I did if you  
can tell them sweating is this I just ran I tell 
you when I ran everyone's looking at me I don't  
know if they thought I was a criminal or some type 
of basketball player but I've heard the basketball  
player turn many times since I've been here I 
guess cuz I'm six foot one look at what we have  
here okay all right the cat was walking with me 
button all right now I'm back to the home let's  
see if I have any faces left over all right so 
I go back at the doll I keep on many young folks  
see what I can do to help this family out and 
I have a couple of friends with me that's going  
to help me translate in their Bisaya language 
so they will go ahead and be my vlog vloggers
okay so I wanted to say so just explain to 
them that I just want to help so for whatever  
it takes I know you have a big family here I have 
3,000 after showing up this exchange of the three  
thousand four hundred pesos which is roughly just 
sixty six thousand sixty seven cents they said  
they were very appreciative it's pretty much told 
me think multiple times and that they were happy
all right so one may say well only 3400 but 
keep in mind that here in the Philippines  
most banks will only allow you to withdraw ten 
thousand pesos at one time or even at per day
10,000 misses is less than 200 us so I 
did not have that much with me money so  
I do plan on going to a team later but at 
that time I'll be away from the island but  
that's all I had to give so I do have to 
travel my rickshaw essentially tricycle  
taxi bus boat bless those who sure 
needed assistance and just keep going
