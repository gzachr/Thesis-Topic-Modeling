of sweet sour and salty displaying spanish  
chinese american dutch and aboriginal 
malay influences that date back over

just means like rice and like eggs 
this is my favorite filipino this is
something something salty filipinos like to 
pear stuff like that like sweet and salty at  
the same time i think banana leaf is so pretty 
it's like a nice touch of presentation filipino
vanilla with a taste of coconut yeah you really 
like vanilla you like coconut you like pantone  
oh yes oh wow you don't find these kind of 
flavors anywhere else wow the more you try  
i really like this one too i know grass 
would taste that good again with pork  
and bok choy if you're filipino it can be either 
or traditionally not rice with just about every  
single meal whether it's breakfast lunch or it's 
a blank canvas and it has mirian applications
oh i'm surprised okay this is 
sour sweet i'm drinking soup now

tasty looking stuff so this

the sour is just right on all the meat and 
the eggplant and the squash really good dish

across the globe its mission is to spread 
the joy of eating all right guys this is  
a jollibee video but we're gonna be eating 
with three of our friends today one two three  
first appearance on a vlog that was true that's 
why we got all this food what are your favorite  
things to order in jelly beans i like the chicken 
sandwich that's definitely my favorite oh i see a  
big bucket of chicken joy like you can't go wrong 
it's my favorite fast food in new york city by far  
people always ask if you want something 
unique there's only two of these in all  
new york city so this is one of the most unique 
fast food experiences you can get as a tourist
i'm going to take a bite
do you hear that yeah they're crunchy the crunch 
is insane we do another bite so i get a big crunch  
how is it really good i love the skin it's 
so crunchy and with a little gravy on top  
fast food perfection for me adriana what's your 
channel i can give you the names adriana mrvn i  
think you can put all that together and it's 
gonna come out all right let's go okay this  
spaghetti this filipino spaghetti is very special 
because it's sweeter than what you're used to  
and this spaghetti has chunks of hot 
dogs and banana ketchup and ground meat  
sources i love the spaghetti according to one 
of the top comments on one of my many jollibee  
videos the jolly spaghetti was created with 
children's taste buds in mind you kind of feel  
that after eating it how sweet it is it's 
so sweet usually you used to salty savory  
love or hate jolly spaghetti i've never 
gotten in between i like it a lot but i  
like sweet stuff honestly like mcdonald's in 
china it's targeted towards kitsu even here  
a lot of sweet stuff so i think to do 
all your business go after the children
i told myself i didn't have this chicken sandwich 
for so long that's why i wasn't shooting poop is  
the best one but now that i had it again i'm like 
yeah this is definitely the best one adriana i'm  
so excited today i used to joke that she eats 
for two and now we're serious she really is  
does your baby like who you eat when 
you're pregnant doesn't mean your baby  
will like jalab in the future probably i 
can see a little kid liking the spaghetti  
i'm telling you my kid's gonna grub 
with jolly uh chicken joy for sure
