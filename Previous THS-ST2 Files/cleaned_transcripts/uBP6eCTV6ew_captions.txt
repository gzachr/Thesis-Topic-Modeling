Good afternoon from El Nido here in the Philippines you might not be able to see it under this
helmet but I need a haircut so we're currently
driving through the beautiful roads here I
just left like the the main city of El Nido
I'm gonna try find a barber on the side of
the road I've seen a few huts where a couple
people are getting Cuts done getting shaved
I don't think I'll get a shave just yet I
might get it cleaned up but we're not going
to get a clean shave until later on but I'm
in desperate need of an actual haircut I'll
show you guys when we when we find a place
how bad my hair is but yeah definitely need
to get a trim freshen up looking all good
looking all pogi gwapo all of the above ah
but yeah let's go on and find person here
so liberating driving through the forest through
the rainforest here
it's just so green and there's so many mountains
so many good that guy was saying yo what's
up give me the peace sign but it's just so
gorgeous here just how can you not just think
this is one of the most beautiful places on
Earth and actually El Nido and Palawan the
island that El Nido was situated on has been
voted the best island in the world multiple
times in the past couple of years so I guess
my statement is actually facts if the mini
magazines top travel companies as to being
the best island in the world and I can see
exactly why people think that because it's
just so good so beautiful so chill the vibes
are great and there's just you know little
markets everywhere little people doing their
shops and riding around look at this guy he's
in like a tricycle here drinking his Seven
Up let's overtake them oh there we are but
uh yeah we're gonna go get a haircut maybe
five off the store like multiple
places and that kind of just like situated
just on the side of the road
cleaned up
it's just such a vibe out here honestly all
right this seems like a little bit of a from
here a couple shops on the side any barber
shops no we've got like grocery stores once
that place more like little supermarkets no
unfortunately not oh here what's this a salon
it looks like the girls oh this is someone
it's like a hair dying salon we don't want
our hair a different color we just want it
a little bit shorter oh my God so this boat
has got four motors that is like a oh my God
that is like a military style boat inflatable
four motors on the back where's my barber
shop at I can't see it anywhere
all right let's keep going oh no mayday everybody mayday mayday big may day code red alert there's
a bug in my eye okay let's pull over oh my
God that is a big bug
ah ah that was a horrible experience you can
see the bug
all right what is that oh my God that just
got into my eye all right it serves me right
I'm not wearing the visor I think we're in
the clear but my eyes gonna be pretty red
the issue with wearing this is that it's so
scratched like I can barely see and it's also
got like weird lighting lighting flares so
what's up bro you good
oh all right let's hope nothing else gets
into my eye surely here there's got to be
a barbershop
no no no Barber Shop here that's a restaurant
what are those just stores can't find one
what's a man got to do to find a barber shop
to get his hair cut up
anywhere down here
nope is this one nope
so am I I thought this would be way easier
there's always a barber shop when you don't
want one but when oh no not again oh my goalie
I
this is turning into a disastrous video everybody
let's put the visor down and when I actually
find a shop
I don't I don't think you can hear me when
I actually find a barber shop I'll pull in
I gotta stop vlogging on the road this is
dangerous let's do it
I did not think it was going to be this hard
I swear I was driving along this road like
a couple of hours ago just going for a ride
I don't remember going this far and I swear
I came across a couple maybe when I had the
bug in my eye okay I went past them accidentally
I'll go off for a couple hundred meters and
then we'll turn back I think we've gone through
the major cities I I don't know the little
towns like this just seems like super remote
yeah I don't think there's anything up there
we'll turn around when we can
all right turning turning all right let's
go back there's got to be one in those major
cities all those like major towns I'll get
back to you guys when I'm there
all right I think we're coming up to that
main little town again has to be one there
I don't know that's I think where I got the
bug in my eye so it makes sense if I missed
it when I was driving through there's got
to be one here surely we'll keep a big big
eye out

absolutely chomp through it all like I was
a little bit worried at the beginning as to
how fast he was going but it's like actually
exactly the length that I wanted you know
this will grow out nicely you took off a bit
at the top as well
that has a bit a bit short but just looking
good looking pogi
nice I'm happy here are the other options
we have so we got like 20 styles that can
be done these are like some really popular
haircuts so the Filipino people love like
kind of like the fade short stuff on the sides
and then long on the bottom you can see these
guys here super clean fade and then long on
the bottom on on the top so
we've even got music in the background
