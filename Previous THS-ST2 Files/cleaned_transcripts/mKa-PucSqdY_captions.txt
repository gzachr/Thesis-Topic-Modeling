Chu arrived in Philippines  
Behind episode 2
 
 
 
 
 
 
Chu is a fan of Love team
Let’s go up~~
Where are you going?
Hello~ Hello I’m here
This is S&R
 
 
 
 
Embarrassed by her own market-reaction
Common S&R snacks in Philippines
This looks delicious!!
Sprinted to the target(?)
 
 
Hi there?
There are so many things to see
I’m just hanging around
 
Omg!
I am a model for this product!
It’s me!!
Found a mask pack that Chu worked as a model!
Why did Chu come out of there?
So nice to see this in Philippines
It’s me / Is it true? Yeah Chu, It’s you… you're right...
It’s Snail Face Mask!
 
 
I used this last night
Let’s check it out
Putting on the mask pack that she put in the fridge
It's cold!
Chu’s face is much smaller than a mask pack
Harp seal?
Shy Shy
 
So embarrassed, then turned into a Zombie
I’ll use a mask pack for 10 minutes then go to sleep
 
 
Here is the end of Chu’s secret daily routine
Good night
It's written right over here! Kriesha's Choice. 
It was nice to meet you
I chose!
Here is the Philippines game arcade!
I will do that! Piano Blocks!
Shows her willingness to play her favorite piano game
Selecting carefully
Shall we do Big Bang's Haru Haru?
Let's do it! Haru Haru
Omg! I think it’s pretty fast!
Soon, you will see a quick hand Chu, the game master
Soon, you will see a quick hand Chu, the game master
Already started
Compressed lips
Sleepy but intense look that could break(?) the monitor
Chu entered the safety zone soon
Softly using a wrist snap while you play the pinano~
Focus
The touch changed from soft to strong!
See the reaction rate
Why is the song so long? Wasn’t it this long?
Then the game is over!
Yay!!!
Still, she got the gift token with good results!
Gift tokens are coming out without a pause!
After that, Chu played so many games
Wrapped gift token around Best driver Chu
Saving the earth from Zombies
One shot One kill
Chu amazed by her talent~
Kriesha Chu saved the earth
There is nothing she can’t do
Gift tokens are coming out without a pause!
Here comes the gift token again
The queen of the game is excited
Heaped
Here are all the presents for you. Take it al
