How much money do you think they spent on this?
A lot, for sure

Wow!
Are they sending them back to the Philippines?
Oh my god, they're...
Christmas?
It's warm, so warm
Warm country, right?
Yeah, but they still have Christmas though...
Wow, I'm actually tearing up right now, this is so sad
This is like the best commercial I've ever seen in my whole life
This is so good
Wow, I kinda get now why everybody was like
You guys have to watch the Jollibee commercials

Oh, are they going back?!
Oh, they're going back to the Philippines, oh my god! 
They're gonna surprise the kid!
Oh my god!
He's grown up...wait...
Is that what happened?
Wait, wait, they're gonna meet...
They're gonna see [each other]
No, this is actually nice!
But what does this have to do with Jollibee though?
I don't...I don't get it...
What does it have to do with Jollibee?
Oh, because now they're gonna go
Wow, look at that!
BOOM, right at the emotional moment, Jollibee comes in!

Father's Day special
Today is actually...we're recording this on Father's Day
This would be a good one to watch
Let's start this commercial, ready, go!
"Kwentong Jollibee"
What does Kwentong mean...?
I don't...I don't know
"Press play for joy"?
Oh, true story? The tears are definitely gonna come out right now
First love
The music gets me instantly!
Aww, so cute!
First man who loved me!
Oh, because...
What is Kwentong? I want to know what Kwentong means...
John: What does that mean? Kwentong
Who is that...?
Oh, because she's sad right now
Oh, the narrator is the girl...
Oh, they're gonna give her a shot...oh...
She's crying...!
"I know I'll be okay"
Yumburger? What's a Yumburger?
I don't think the New York [Jollibee] has a Yumburger...
Old burger, young burger
Oh, now he's old...I KNEW he was gonna get old!
I knew he was gonna get old!
They're getting married
That's so sweet
For real?
What?
No, no, that was fake crying
But it is really sweet
I don't think this one is as good as the other one though
The other one felt more emotional to me
Dude, so many people [watched this]
Look at this!
7.5 million?!
That's insane!
Xiaoma: Crazy!
John: It's a commercial!
It's a commercial, yeah!
But it's an emotional commercial, you know?
Wow
