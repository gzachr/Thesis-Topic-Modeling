- Hello!
- Hello!
- This is gonna be great.
- Today, we have a very
special Filipino treat
because we're joined by Budgie,
who is the brains behind Apoy, Sarap
and "Great British Menu" alumni.
This is pretty special.
- Yeah, very excited.
Very, very, very honoured to be here.
- It's so nice to have a
real chef in the kitchen.
- [Jamie] I know, who can dress well.
- Yeah.
- Yes.
- A cool, real chef.
- I almost wore that shirt today.
(they laugh)
- It was in the memo.
I got told to wear it.
(upbeat music)
(Mike sniffing)
- Stop trying to cheat.
- I smell something citrusy.
- Boys, Budgie has already put
number one under the cloche.
Lift away.
- They look like tiny little limes.
- Scratch and sniff. What you getting?
- It's sweeter than lemon.
- Yes. It smells sweet.
- Baby limes.
- Oh, I mean all of it
is very, very correct.
It is citrusy, it is limey,
but it is a calamansi,
which is essentially our main citrus
found in the Philippines and
all throughout southeast Asia.
But it is a native fruit
to the Philippines.
- You just bite it like a kumquat.
- This, I feel like
we're being stitched up.
- Well, I feel like we're being...
- Budgie, can we bite directly into it?
- Of course you can bite it.
- Okay, fine.
- I wouldn't, but...
(music stops abruptly)
(they laugh)
- Yes, Budgie! You get the idea.
- But yes you can.
(whimsical music)
- Oh yeah, so like it's
a really fragrant juice.
It almost, it's citrusy.
It's not really, really sour,
but yeah, it's almost floral, isn't it?
- Yeah. I think it's got a flavour profile
somewhere in between
sort of lime and kumquat.
So you know, it doesn't have that
sort of intense lime properties.
- Yeah like a bitterness, like
a really pleasant bitterness.
- That will probably come
out a little bit more
because you've taken a
nice bite out of the skin.
But in terms of the juice itself,
really refreshing and sort
of in between that lime
and kumquat sort of flavour profile.
It's an ubiquitous flavour
in the Philippines.
- So whereabouts would this
get used in Filipino cuisine?
- Pretty much anywhere.
You know, from drinks to dipping sauces
to flavourings and marinades,
and yeah, it's such a key
part of Filipino cuisine.
You know, one of the
things that we try and do
in Apoy and and Sarap
is to try and recreate
Filipino flavours using local ingredients.
In this case, that is
something that we just can't,
we can't replicate.
- We are not compromising on these.
- No.
- Budgie, you mentioned drinks.
- Yes.
- What should we get them to make?
- Well, my favourite of
mine would be a margarita.
- Oh.
- Calamansi margarita, boys.
- Calamansi margarita.
- I'm up for that.
- Let's do it.
- Yes.
- First thing we need to do
is get some calamansi juice.
So split them in half.
- I'll chop, you squeeze.
- Yeah.
- [Budgie] You need about a
shot glass worth, about 50ml.
- They squeeze really easy.
- Yeah.
A bit of ice in the shaker.
(ice clinks)
- We've got some icebergs.
- Shot of tequila.
(cork pops)
- Such a satisfying sound.
- Mm.
- Okay, well now your
lips have been on that.
- It's gonna taste better, isn't it.
- [Budgie] Accurately measured, of course.
- I was gonna say, free pour,
he thinks he's Tom Cruise.
- He's not Tom Cruise.
- Half of that amount of Grand
Marnier, calamansi juice.
- Sorry, you sit there.
- I am.
- About half a shot of syrup.
Cool.
In the shaker. Give it a good shake.
(lid clunks firmly)
- Please.
(shaker rattling)
- [Mike] Shake it till it
gets too cold to handle.
- A good old calamansi rimming.
- Yep.
(they snicker)
(upbeat music)
- [Jamie] Oh yeah.
- You've really put the
cock in this cocktail.
Well done.
- And then maybe a half
a calamansi for garnish.
(bright chill-out music)
- Look at that.
- Oh, that is smooth.
I reckon we could add a bit more juice.
- Oh wow. That is great.
- Different to some of the margaritas
you might have had
previously with just lime.
- These are not as harshly
acidic as other citrus fruits.
So you do get all that bitterness
and it just tastes smoother.
- Yeah.
- That is a great way of explaining it.
- That just takes it to a different place.
In a way, it makes it
much easier to drink.
- Yeah, it gives that citrusy
note but not that acidic-
- Yeah, kick.
- intensity. Yeah.
- I'm sure those calamansi
will make another appearance later on.
But let's look at cloche number two.
- We don't have to take our
clothes off to have a good lime.
- That's a calamansi.
- Oh (beep)
- I like that one. That was a good one.
- [Mike] If you are enjoying this,
there are some small things you can do
that make a big difference to us.

(screen wipe whooshes)
(funky upbeat music)
- Okay boys, I'm intrigued to
see your reaction on this one.
- Superb start by the way. Thank you.
- Boom! Oh.
- Oh.
- Oh.
- Looks cocoa nibby.
- It does look cocoa nibby.
- But they...
- They're red.
- Each one has got a little speck on it.
Can you see? Like it's got,
each one's got-
- Like a little eye.
- Like a little nubbin.
- Little, little potato eye.
- Probably not something you
want to eat in vast quantities,
but by all means, you know, have a lick.
- That means it's
poisonous if you neck that.
- Have a lick.
- Let's find out.
- All I can taste is the
calamansi on my fingers.
- Yeah, hang on.
- From squeezing them.
- I almost inhaled it.
- They're chewy.
I was expecting them to
be like a coffee bean.
- Mm.
- But they're not. They're really chewy.
- You got any idea?
- It's bitter.
- It tastes like earth.
No, like really bitter at the end.
- Really bitter.
- Mm.
- I can still only taste the calamansi.
- Okay.
(they laugh)
- So it is annatto seeds or achiote seeds.
So a natural coloured pigment.
So yellowish, orangy red.
In terms of flavour, very sort of earthy
but more so used for the
colour than it is for flavour.
Generally we don't use
it in the seed format.
What we generally do is we
extract the colour from the seeds.
So we either crush them into a powder
and then you can sort of
extract flavour from that.
But the easiest way would
be in a bit of water
or a bit of oil with some other aromats.
Things like bay leaf,
garlic and things like that.
Some lemongrass. And you
get this really, really
bright reddish oil or water.
And that's what we use
in the cooking part,
for the colouring and things like that,
on a number of dishes.
- Wow.
- But it's a seed not
native to the Philippines.
It came via the sort of
Americas through Mexico,
through the sort of galleon trade of Spain
when we were ruled by Spain.
- When you think of it
as a colouring now, boys,
where else close to home
might you recognise it?
Have you been to Leicester recently?
- Red Leicester cheese?
- Correct.
- No!
- Really?
- It's coloured with the same stuff.
- Yeah, its main commercial
use is for food colouring,
natural food colouring.
And it's used in cheese,
Red Leicester one of which
was a great surprise to me
when I first found out.
But yeah.
- Wow.
- Are we gonna eat something
or are we gonna cook something?
- Should we try marinade?
- Yes!
- Yes.
- So we're gonna make
a classic Filipino dish
called inasal chicken.
So first thing we're gonna do is
we're gonna make some of the annatto oil,
add some annatto seeds to the pan,
a couple of aromats in there.
So bay leaves, some ginger, garlic.
You know, you don't have to do that.
I like it just to give it
a little bit more flavour.
- Not bay leaves?
- I'm conflicted.
- Yeah.
- 'Cause a real chefs using bay leaves.
- I know.
- It's the way forward.
- We have this argument,
all the normals in the studio are like,
"Bay leaves, what are they
do? They don't do anything."
Whereas the chefs are like,
they're unbelievable and they work.
- There's always an
argument with bay leaves.
You kind of, you know,
you dunno what they do, but you kind of,
you know when they're not in there.
- Yeah.
- You know?
- They give it that little something.
You can't be...
- Yeah, yeah.
You don't know what it is.
- That's not winning me over.
- When people ask me,
well what does it do?
I'm like I dunno.
But I do know when it's not in there.
So you can really start
to smell the aroma now.
- Yeah, yeah. Definitely.
- Smell the redness.
(Jamie laughs)
Now it's a bit of oil.
You don't want anything
with too much flavour on it.
- Okay. So rape seed oil's perfect.
Bring that to sort of a simmer.
And that will allow the colour
to leach out of the seeds
and infuse into the oil.
- Awesome.
- So as you can see,
the colour is starting
to leach out already.
Once it starts to bubble up a little bit,
take it off the heat
and you're really much,
pretty much done with it.
- I've done such a great job.
(they laugh)
- That was great.
Couldn't have done it
better myself, to be honest.
Perfect.
- Well done, Jay.
- Well done mate.
- Budgie, you're welcome.
- Well done, mate.
So next thing we're gonna do
very quickly is the butter.
- Okay.
- The basting butter.
So any excess trims, fat on the chicken,
don't throw them away.
We're gonna stick that on there,
render that nice and slowly.
Then we obviously put
some butter in there.
Now you can do one of two things.
You can either put the
annattos oil into that as well
or you can add annatto seeds and things.
So we're gonna do both
'cause we've got both.
- [Ben] More of the
calamansi coming into play.
- Calamansi, again, a
flavour of the Philippines.
So it will be part of the marinade.
So what we're gonna do
is we're gonna marinade
a whole chicken with some calamansi,
some ginger, some garlic,
some of the annatto oil
to give it that sort of bright colour.
Some Sprite.
(music stops abruptly)
Or 7up, up to you. Lemonade in general.
- That's a curve ball, isn't it?
- How... Why?
- That's classic.
Sugar, citrusy flavour, sweetness.
- And that's like an
authentic Filipino thing?
- Yeah. Yeah, definitely.
- I've used cola before.
- Yeah.
- To do various sort of like...
- Are you afraid of saying "Coke"?
- Or gammon. No, I'm saying cola
because maybe it wasn't Coke that I used.
It might have been another one.
- Panda Pop.
(Mike laughing)
- And then the other key ingredient in it
is coconut vinegar.
- Oh yes!
- Yeah. Love that stuff.
- So I mean,
it doesn't have that same astringency,
you know, in the back of your throat.
There's a little bit of sweetness to it
from, obviously the natural
sugars of the coconut.
And then depending on which
sort of vinegars you use,
certain ones have
different flavour profiles.
So you've got ones that can be made from
the sap of the coconut tree
and that's a different flavour altogether.
Then you've got the actual coconut water
that turns into vinegar as well.
So there's multiple things
that can be used for the vinegar itself.
(upbeat music)
That's rendering away nice and slowly.
Now we make, we get onto the marinade.
So don't need to be too,
you know, fancy with this.
This is just a bit of ginger.
- It's also the sign of a great chef
when he comes with his own knife.
- Yeah, it's a really cool knife.
- I know I should be surprised
when we have a real chef
and they show their knife skills.
But every single time it just gets me.
- I didn't listen to a word you just said
because I was looking at the
perfect dice on that garlic.
- I've had a bit of practise.
- Yeah.
- Out of interest,
when did you start
learning to cook, Budgie?
- This is the second
career for me, actually.
I started cooking when I moved
to London about 11 years ago.
Prior to that, when I was
living in Sydney, I was,
I was in IT, so...
- Oh, that's-
- Bit of a different-
- quite different, yeah.
- Bit of a different route.
It's been a fun ride, fun journey.
- Do you miss the IT world?
- Not at all.
(they laugh)
You know, it's been the best
decision of my life, really.
A decision for the soul as
opposed to anything else really.
- It's a lovely way of thinking about it.
- Turning it on and off again.
(Jamie laughs)
- Yeah.
I'm getting some lemongrass
in there as well now.
So even with the
calamansi juice, some 7up,
or Sprite. Oh sorry, Sprite.
Lemonade. Lemonade.
Some coconut vinegar.
This is the annatto oil now.
- J, make yourself useful.
- J, hold it.
- Hold that for me please, J.
- Make yourself useful, J.
- Thank you.
There you go.
(chilled-out music)
From there, we just wanna
marinade the chicken.
We've got a whole chicken
here, we've just butterflied,
taken the skin off,
and you want to marinade this
for at least sort of three to four hours.
Overnight is great.
- Now the good thing is you
sent us your recipe earlier,
so we do have, here's one we made earlier.
- Yes.
- The magic of.
(upbeat music)
so inasal is actually
from a certain region,
or one area that it's well known for.
It's called Bacolod.
And inasal is the local
dialect word for barbecue.
So traditionally this would
be barbecued over charcoal.
- Which you did request,
but then we told you about our fire alarm.
- Yeah.
- Stuff like that.
If anything, Filipino
food is very adaptable.
So in the oven's fine,
you know, finishing it on the grill
at last minute to get
a sort of nice colour.
Most important thing that you need to do
is constantly baste it
with this chicken fat,
butter, salt, pepper.
And you're just constantly basting that,
putting it back in the oven
and you're just building on that flavour
when you serve it with some rice.
So as much as I'd love to
you to try this right now-
- I would love to try that right now.
- Let's try this right now.
- We've got one more
thing that we need to do
before we go and try it.
- Let's lift the cloche to number three.
(upbeat music)
All yours J.
- Oh.
- Oh.
- It looks like soy and shallot.
Maybe lemon grass?
- It may be lemongrass.
- Oh, these are really delicately chopped.
- This is almost like I diced them.
(music stops abruptly)
- The clue is the chicken
that you've just made
would dip wonderfully in it.
But first off, let's work out what it is.
- I'm gonna try some.
(upbeat music)
Wow.
- Ay caramba.
- Wow!
- Woo.
Talk about packing a punch.
- Fiery garlic.
- Definitely some chilli
going on in there as well.
- Is it soy? No.
What is it?
It's really sweet.
- It's a sort of soy, like a sweet soy.
- So this is one example of sawsawan.
Sawsawan essentially
means a dipping sauce.
And it is something that
every Filipino table has
and it's a way to customise
everything to your liking essentially.
So there is no right,
there is no wrong in terms of sawsawan.
There's definitely some basics,
you know, soy sauce being one of them.
In this case, soy sauce,
shallots, some garlic
and some chilies in there as
well for a little bit of spice
and a couple of other little
ingredients in there as well.
So calamansi obviously.
- Obviously.
- And the other one being coconut vinegar.
- Oh, that's it.
- Ah!
- And that's again,
bringing that sweetness,
having that sort of balance
between sweet, sour and salty.
- It's a fruity sweetness.
It's absolutely stunning.
- [Ben] Just as an example,
that's coconut vinegar and the soy.
(upbeat music)
- Would you like a little
refresher of coconut vinegar?
- Yes, I would. Cheers.
- Maybe don't shot it.
- I will if you will.
- I mean...
each to their own to be fair.
(record scratch)
- Stop.
That's really not how it's
supposed to be consumed.
- Think about how much...
- You gave me a tequila.
Whoa!
It's delicious.
It is a sipper.
- Would you like to
dip some chicken in it?
- Yes.
- Yes!
- Let's put the two together.
(bright music)
- [Mike] What's the
correct way to eat this?
- Traditionally it's with a fork
or what we call kamayan
in the Philippines,
which means eating with your hands.
- Oh my gosh. Smell that.
That is ridiculous.
Not my one. Smell your own.
(they laugh)
- Always with rice. Can't go without rice.
Little bit of that chicken fat, butter.
Pour that over your rice.
- [Mike] You'd better
save some of that for me.
- Fat is definitely flavour in that case.
There you go.
And then-
- Customise to choice.
- And then customise it
with your dipping sauce.
- This is incredible.
Already, you know it's
gonna taste amazing.
- Hurry up.
- I'm hurrying,
sorry, sorry, sorry.
- Cheers.
- Cheers.
- Does it still taste red?
- Oh, it tastes better than red.
- It tastes orange.
Like red but more exciting.
- Oh my goodness. That is so good.
- The chicken is so
tender from that marinade.
I'm going in for a dip.
I'm going in for a dip.
- Going for the dip.
- Here we go. I'm so buzzing.
- You're gonna love that.
- This is amazing.
- I think the big thing for
me is how balanced it is.
You've got a little bit of warmth there
when you've got the dipping sauce,
but it's sweet, it's sour, salty.
It's, yeah.
- I need more of this.
- You know, and don't take
away from the rice as well.
You know, we've got such
high impact flavoured food,
you know, the rice kind
of helps to sort of-
- To mop.
- Yeah, mop it up
and also kind of balance
it out a little bit.
You know, sometimes it's a little intense
and you take a little bite of rice
and it kind of brings it
back together as well.
- Have you got room for dessert?
- Ebbers, don't stop me.
Give me five minutes.
(funky music)
- How do you top that?
- Can we top that?
- I think we can.
(Jamie laughs)
- Go on then, Mr. Colorblind.
- Is it purple?
- It is purple.
- I'm gonna say a word.
- Yammy.
- Ooh.
- Yammy?
- Yeah, it does look nice.
- [Budgie] Yeah. Very sticky.
Very sweet.
- Mm.
It's pappy, but it does taste vegetabley.
So I feel like I might not
be far off with purple yams.
- Yes, it is.
- Is... Is that, is it this thing?
- That is delicious.
- That is,
that particular thing in
there is called ube halaya.
So ube is a purple yam
and halaya is essentially
cooked down into a jam.
So nailed it basically.
- It wasn't that good a guess.
- Just because you didn't guess it.
- I did have some fresh ube,
unfortunately Customs took that off me.
- Customs?
- Confiscated at the border.
We should probably say,
Budgie landed from Australia yesterday
and they're still coming to
film with us, which is amazing.
But he literally had ube under his arm
and they were like, "No sir, you cannot."
- No way, ube. (laughs)
- So yeah,
so we've got the ube halaya here,
which is essentially made
from cooking down ube
with a little bit of sugar.
So it's a jam, basically.
- It's really, really tasty.
- It's used in desserts.
In many sort of applications,
you can bake with it,
I mean, use it as a jam.
And probably my most favourite,
most nostalgic of all,
of all desserts, Filipino desserts
would be halo halo.
- [Both] Yes.
- It's kind of one of the
really sort signature dishes
on "The Great British Menu"
that kind of won so much attention.
- Yeah. Yeah, I mean it's
one of those dishes where
it brings back so much
childhood memories for everyone.
So it's a very nostalgic dish.
A halo halo basically means mix mix
and it crosses the line
between a drink and a dessert
and a thing you eat.
- All the textures.
- Yeah. And for me it's just a lot of fun.
And it's sort of my childhood
memories all in one.
- That's incredible.
- Let's make one.
(screen wipe whooshes)
(upbeat ragtime music)
- Where do we start?
- Halo halo
- What have we got?
- We've got red beans,
sweetened red beans.
We've got coconut jelly,
green coconut jelly,
jackfruit, sweet corn.
This is-
- What's this?
- This is jackfruit.
- That's the jackfruit.
- Yeah. We've got some
mango in here as well.
And then we're gonna
have some ube ice cream,
which is where this
guy goes into that guy.
- Sorry, did you say sweetcorn?
- You can have sweet corn, you
don't have to have sweetcorn
- What you playing for, mate?
- Up to you.
- Should we see if I can get it wrong?
- Let's see if you can get it wrong.
(they laugh)
Let's see if you can get it wrong.
So, basically we're gonna do
a little bit of each on the bottom.
Let me get the jackfruit and
chop that up a little bit.
- Are we gonna compare this halo halo
to the one that we made on
the channel a few years ago.
- That looked a bit like
this. (snaps fingers)
- Sweetcorn, would you say?
- Yeah, a little bit.
- Some greenery.
- There you go.
And then we're gonna get some shaved ice.
- You say this is a real nostalgic thing.
- Yeah.
- Is it something that
people do at home? Is this
restaurant, is this street food?
Where do we see it?
- Yeah. it's kind of,
it's everywhere really.
You can buy all of these in a jar ready,
but you can even buy
them as a mix altogether,
together in one.
There you go.
- It's got your beans,
it's got your jelly,
it's got your coconut bits.
- [Mike] It's less
colourful than ours though.
- Sweetcorn?
- No sweetcorn.
- Oh, well. See.
- So it's evaporated milk.
And then we're gonna finish
off with some ube ice cream.
You know, you can go as
little or as much as you like.
- [Mike] Oh, two scoops. I love it.
- Yeah. Look at that.
- The colour of that.
- So, straw-
- And a spoon.
- Spoon.
There you go. Halo halo.
(they applaud)
- Nice.
(upbeat music)
- Lucky dip. Oh, there's some like...
- Some of the grassy jelly.
- Yeah, it's unbelievable.
- The ube ice cream has
such a great texture.
It's almost, it's like gelato.
Like it's so thick and creamy.
- Yeah.
- It's almost chewy.
- It's obviously got starch in it.
It adds to the texture.
- It's, oh, it's stunning.
- Budgie, this has been amazing.
Thank you so much.
- No, thank you for the opportunity.
- Every single thing we tasted
has been like genuinely incredible.
- I think what you do so well
is take all the wonders
of the Philippines,
and make it super
accessible here in London,
all over the world.
- To idiots.
- To idiots like us. It's great.
- You know, I'm very proud of our cuisine
and we just wanna champion and show people
how easily accessible Filipino cuisine is
and how delicious it is.
- For sure. For sure.
And you guys can check
out more from Budgie
in the links down below.
Comment which of those
four was brand new to you?
- All four.
- All four.
- All four.
- All four.
- All four.
- I am regretting shotting
that coconut vinegar.
