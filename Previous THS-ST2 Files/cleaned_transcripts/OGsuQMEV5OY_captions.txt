awesome
same as local taste we ate this in cebu
crispy . i love this texture
garlic is also nice
how can i explain this taste ?
just good
yes that's lit
korean style= boiled pork 
filipino style = boiled & fried pork
the texture is better than korean style
-i agree
korean style = smooth like pudding
filipino style = crispy like snacks
yes pork skin is crispy
how's the angle of camera ?
it's ok
damn good
huge piece
i will eat this all
lechon kawali rocks!
too hot, but the food is great
(no pain, no gain)
it's difficult to cook indoors
-yeah 
because of oil
it's better to eat outdoors
here's the jungle
-no , my house
smith , how does it taste?
ah... i bit my tongue!
cuz its delicious?
tongue= side dish of nice food
hey wait..
let's enjoy it with bagoong
lechon kawali & bagoong

real filipino flavor... exotic !
it tastes nice but
i think soy sauce + vinegar is better 
- i think so
i feel like philippines here, hot weather & filipino foods.. 
-really
will you even wear a suit when you go to the philippines?
-sure
woah.. nice
oh.. angle..
last piece is for your parents right?
i can eat this alone.. so nice

Foreigners usually think korean-style is delicious
but it's not  lechon kawali is better
-i think so
 
you have to go to the hospital
always fart, burp
go to hospital
nope
keep reacting guys
this is my reaction
seriously
seriously
i m okay
is this laurel leaf is edible?
yes
too chewy..
-inedible
no need to eat this korean sauce
yes its delicious enough
soy sauce + vinegar is the best
the sauce was nice
hey dude! stop!
it was delicious
-this chair is uncomfortable
nice, how was it guys
i' m stuffed, cuz it's a pork belly
and we ate 2kg
-really? 2 kg?
we ate it a lot, wow
i didn't recognize it, because it's delicious
-me too
it was plenty but we ate it all 
yeap ate it like a horse
so nice, its insane
local taste really and
hot weather & outdoors
it feels like
i'm in the philippines
it was delicious
so my hair color has changed
you wanna talk about your hair color, right?
it was hot today, so it was hard to cook
but it was worth a try
and it is similar to korean style
but the texture is better than korean style , because it's fried dish
it reminds me of cebu travel
so it was nice
now i know this is filipino taste
it was nice
but i think the korean pork belly that i make is more delicious
anyway, it was delicious
nice dish, it can be served to my guests
-yeah , really nice
i love this crispy texture
lechon kawali was nice
-the best
