Mia:Look at that!he got his slippers not his sandals
I don't  want my slippers
Mia:We are here again in our barbecue house
Mia: John cannot me comfortable
Mia: We are here again in our barbecue house
and today I feel like we are very productive
Mia: how many videos we've made
today, quite a few isn't it?
Mia: We've made a few videos today
and I am so proud of you
Mia: And today will tackle about pros
and cons about marrying a Filipina
Mia: Look at his face.
Mia: There you go
John: Pros and Cons!
John: Well there is no cons, its all pros
John: That's all
Mia: So, what are the pros and cons ??
John: Well one thing definitely say if you meet the right one,
-no I don't need it so close if you meet
John:if you meet right one,
John: age doesn't matter that is one sure a thing
John:So when I meet the right one I will tell you, joke!
Mia: C'mon you need to tell what's the pros and cons
John: Okay so age doesn't matter, that is one sure a thing
John: Right
John: I think one of the first and foremost thing that I really notice so much was..
the loyalty and
you know how well she wants to look
after me I don't know why what she does
you know which is marvelous wonderful
but I can assure you she's not here for
that she's here to be my wife my best
friend and enjoy life together and do
things together and make memories mmm..you know
that's what it's for so really if you
meet the right one there are definitely
no cons it's just pros because you know
we have a wonderful relationship, ...okay we
have our little moments we might have
slight differences but end of the day
everything always comes resolved very
quickly with us and it's good so you
know all I would say is if you Filipino girls looking for it you know
A British guy or an older guy you
know all I would say don't cling onto
the first one you find, you know ..make sure
he is 100% what you want
and same for him as well, you know and
then if that's the case then try to move
forward but all I says don't move
forward quickly which you can never from the
Philippines anyway because everything
takes so long to do which is good
in one sense cause it gives you the time
to make sure you good for each other before
you commit properly and we did
Only about six months but you know , long enough won't it? 
but we knew straight away though that was a
thing yeah I told her she loved me and
that was it,
Mia: That's it!
John: Did you not hear what I say?
Mia: What did you say?
John: I told you that you love me
Mia: That you...?
John: love me...
Mia: No..
Mia: i didn't
Mia: No, i didn't! LOL!
John: but no...
Mia: C'mon what more?
right well what else could I really say
you know one of the big pros definitely is..
is for us living in the UK and then
going visiting the Philippines
it's like in the Philippine!Specially some
of the islands it's like paradise and
it's such a wonderful place to go to,  you
know...what the nice thing is ...your wife is
native to the country so you know it
makes it very easy cause you understand
more all the traditions and stuff that's
go on you know so certainly you know
going back to the Philippines with you
wife is good we've we've had some
wonderful times you know
and we will
continue to do so
not going this year
because very busy one thing you know the
plus we booked a holiday somewhere else
and we have possibly to renew Mia's visa
Mia: What do you mean possiby???
John: Depends if she behaves :D
Mia: Possibly??????
John: no, just joking
John: but and then once it all get out of way
John: then a..
Mia: We possibly go to New York
John: Oh well yeah Mia met 
someone in New York and we're probably going
on visit there...
fortunately were lucky enough
to be able to do that  you know..
John:so yeah the only cons
ahh pros..Yeah Cons!
Mia: Say it again bee
John: The only cons specially when it comes  trying
find Filipino wife to be
is the
mindfield
of some there are some
unfortunately I have to say some very
dishonest people on some of the sites so..
you know
Mia: Not all
john: No I said there are some and
they try to scam but yeah there are many
many good ones but the problem is..
is
those a few bad ones you know make
people very very wary so all I would say
to any Filipino girls who meet in
English guy or any foreigner right
and they're going to meet
say you lived
down in the South, say Mindanao
or somewhere  like that other and you've got to 
to travel.. say to Cebu or Manila
to meet right the only thing I would
suggest is when when you want to travel
you know make that the only time you
would ask him some money for your travel
okay... don't start asking asking asking
because you know people..
we don't like
that basically it's like you know we
will be generous in our where when we
are ready to be generous when we know
we've met the right one because when I
first went on thing(dating site) I put on my profile
if anyone asks for money
I will not reply or speak to them again
I said because meeting.. for me
meet Filipino it was to find
someone genuine and that genuine person
would not be asking you for money and
gifts and things like that they will be
just interested in you as a person and
very luckily was all of those so here we
are today and we can tell the story of
our successful time of..
dating site you know
going through the dating agency well
dating site I should say
And you know meeting someone.
Meeting each other and for us
luckily we were compatible but I think
you should know that
before you actually meet somebody
When you started talking to
people online
if this thing you don't like about the
them
then don't even bother meeting with them
because you obviously won't get on you
don't like them then so you ain't gonna
like them when you physically meet them
move on find the right one then you
don't make any big mistakes in your life
you know cuz it's heart wrenching it's
hard work you know to go through all
this because it's you know
many many miles between each other all I
can say is try cuz I certainly would
recommend it you know I have no no
regrets
apart from she loves me too much
and she gets jealous
Mia: I am a jealous person, SOMETIMES!LOL
John:One of nice things I like
Mia: Again!
John: You have to edit that
John: The thing I like when I wake
up in the morning and I open my eyes
I see my beautiful wife and she always has
a smile on her face when she wakes in
the morning
not many people can say that but  I can.. so anyway
I hope my little bit of information may
go a long way for you to hopefully find
someone and be as lucky as we have, you
know ..and it's not asking about you know
it's not what that person can give you
materialistically it's what it gives you
from within and what you two become when
you are together and what you can create
together
you know through the time shared together
and.. to be honest there's many
wonderful Filipino girls out there
with big house can actually do the same as we
have and I know that... and  there's a lot of
honest guys as well you know.... wanting
the real deal you know.. there are some
not quite they wanted a bit just one
thing, so be very wary of that I don't
need to go into detail I'm sure you
understand what I mean so you know keep
your respect and basically you know they
might say they want to try before the
buy  as saying goes but don't! Be like
Mia, be a lady
and wait
yes and what taught you but it was
worth it yeah, anyway that's me signing
off - to all you Filipino girls right and I
can assure you, If you meet the right
guy age does not matter
whether it's mentally physically you
know sexually anything like that does
not matter because if you've got the
attraction there I can assure you
everything will work a hundred percent
so good luck to you all and I hope you
like this little video and by all means
send your comments see what you think
anyway we're signing off now so we're
going to chill out now we've just had
our dinner and it's early evening so
we're just going to chill out here in
the BBQ house for some beautiful weather
outside and relax
