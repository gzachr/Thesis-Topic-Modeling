we are the lockwoods and we're traveling the 
world to experience up close and in person all  
the natural wonders and distinct cultures that 
our kids would otherwise see only in textbooks  
and TV el nido isn't just one of the most popular 
destinations in the Philippines it's also one of  
the most beautiful spots on the planet so we're 
leaving our beachfront glamping tent for the day  
and heading out in search of Adventure amongst 
the surrounding Islands but with so many hidden  
treasures to explore which will be the most 
memorable let's get to it the island hopping  
tour is private but our ride to get to that 
tour is shared and we're kind of under the  
gun here because apparently we're sharing it with 
somebody who's trying to get to the airport and  
they need to leave it a little bit early so we're 
rushing to get to the van all righty bumpy
ride woohoo bumpy bumpy ride we have a short 
walk to the beach but most of our stuff is  
being carried by our two guides mark DAV AKA 
bone bone and I hello hello guys good morning  
welcome to my blog looks like we've already lost 
Aaron and Brooklyn to the short form Gods we're
coming we're getting fitted for masks and shoes 
and snorkel just uh to protect us so we can see  
underwater all the equipment we're going to need 
for the day and then I can't wait to get started  
the shoes specifically are to protect our beat 
against sea urchin and Jellyfish sharp rocks  
and here is our boat she is the princess 
Nicole V6 v.6 version 6 thank you welcome
aboard we're going to the life vest are mandatory 
for the Coast Guard's eye as we leave and then  
do I tell people we're going to cheat I don't 
think it's cheating the water seems really calm  
um we're all good swimmers actually I'm not but 
everybody else is you ready to get wet buddy uh  
yeah the water actually feels really good when 
I got in halfway pretty warm huh but it's like  
perfect because I'm really hot right now and 
humid and then when I get in the water I'll be  
a little colder and it'll be so refreshing not 
even cold it's so true even though the water is  
really warm it's the breeze you get being wet 
when you come out that is the most refreshing  
part when it's really a hot day and it's a hot 
day ELO is about 40 5 Islands we're going to  
see at least five of them today and this whole 
area is considered a nature reserve and several  
areas are turtle sanctuaries too so no plastics 
no plastics we have the kayak this is called Big  
Lagoon this is minilock Island minilock means 
many lagoons and we're going to we're going to  
go into Big Lagoon but we need to kayak there 
because it's too shallow for these boats to  
make it back there but but you're going to have 
to get it started okay it's actually nice with  
the backpack it's like a seat back for me just 
supports me and I get to sit up hey babe the  
water is so turquoise and Crystal Clear I can put 
my paddle down so so far and still see it so so  
clearly love these Waters so pretty don't forget 
to look up and don't forget to look down so we  
went from about 3 ft deep back there to about 
80 ft deep right here so much darker water it  
actually looks like a Cote because it's still 
very clear beautiful water but it's so deep it  
looks darker all these Cliffs really remind me 
of our poine house boats episode where we lived  
on coron island for about a week and obviously 
I mean it's a Stones Throw to Corone from where  
we are right now so that's logical but oh it's 
nice to be back it's so cool here it's so great  
out here but we also really want to jump into the 
water so bad badly it looks really refreshing but  
they said we have to go up here farther so let's 
keep paddling the guy just went into this little  
tunnel so we're going to see if we can get in 
here too it's tight fit it's a very tight fit  
here there we go good job [Music] buddy excellent 
navigating Colt well done now we should note that  
when we booked this they said you really don't 
have to worry about any of these places being  
particularly busy because the captains do 
a good job of coordinating with one another  
to make sure that there's not too much overlap um 
and not complaining like this is great we're just  
paddling around and the water is beautiful but 
I would call this somewhat busy somewhat crowded  
this this another one of those hidden gems that's 
not so hidden or secret but it is worth coming and  
seeing this especially in that cave I felt like 
because you can only really go one at a time in  
single file so it felt like we had the whole cave 
to ourselves and I don't know if you could hear it  
but our guides were singing so we felt serenad 
all right I guess we might as well all get in
[Music]
huh this crowd is our queue to go although maybe 
the rain clouds up there are also we got to get  
out of here we got more spots to hit before it 
starts raining hopefully man my arms are tired but  
that workout was worth it now the rain is normal 
this time of year so it'll pretty much come and go  
but this is considered the rainy season now we've 
got a 10minute boat ride to our next little stop  
stop number two is the same island but a different 
Lagoon this one's called secret Lagoon not because  
nobody knows about it obviously but because you 
have to go through a little tunnel to get to it  
so we've got a little try we got to get going fast 
because a line is starting to formed the later you  
go in the day the more crowded it is and you can 
only go in pretty much one at a time so let's go  
[Music] we got to get in line here look at that 
dog I think he's fishing he's like staring into  
the water waiting for a fish to come and he's 
going to grab it one at a time and we have to  
watch our head these rocks are pretty sharp watch 
your head sweetheart don't lift it [Music] up oh  
it's cold uhoh Brook's not going to like that 
is this the exit also yeah this water is really  
cold so it's a mixture of the salt water on that 
side and fresh water over here big contrasting  
temperature don't forget to look up it's amazing 
cold sweetheart oh awesome this is a really cool  
cave I'm glad that we came here but the water 
isn't blue or clear it's very gray and opaque  
uh it's also chili chili water and uh so there's 
not a whole lot to see once you're in here it just  
looks really cool looks looks like you're in a 
bat cave and we're ready to go yeah we're ready  
to go our guys just told us there's three kinds 
of water in here there's 70 something per salt  
water 20 something per uh fresh water and 5% human 
5% that's not bad I think swimming pools are like  
eight Mark Rober did an episode on the swimming 
pool PE rope all right on to the next [Music] one  
[Music] we're parking at simu Island Simo Simo 
Simo yeah Simo Simo am I saying it simiso yeah  
simiso Island and it means clear water in Japanese 
but there's a secondary legend for how it got its  
name and this one goes back to a Japanese woman 
diver who got stuck in some of the underwater  
tunnels going in through here ran out of air 
in her tanks and died her name simiso this is  
our Lunch Spot our picnic on the beach and right 
now it's private so we have this log our dining  
table and we had to order ahead of time from a 
resort what we're going to have for lunch so we  
all have the same thing it's rice fried chicken 
some corn uh and then just different sauces the  
kids have gravy and this is teriyaki so we're 
going to re-energize and then head to the next  
spot which is actually not far our yummy lunch it 
was made by NA Pond Beach glamping and if you want  
to see that Resort and what beach glamping is all 
about then check out our previous episode we show  
you the resort the tent the restaurant the whole 
bit but we've got to get back on the boat cuz now  
we're going to go snorkeling we're going to see 
what's under the water now we're at Twin islands  
and they call it twin Islands because these two 
towering rocks are actually connected to each  
other when it's low tide you can see where they're 
connected on the bottom it gets really shallow  
there so that's why they're twins holding hands 
but we're going to head underwater and do some
[Music] snorkeling wow that was so so beautiful 
under there the Philippines has the best  
snorkeling that we have ever seen and we've been 
around but every time we come to the Philippines  
every time there's a snorkel spot I am blown away 
and I think that I could spend hours under there  
col could probably spend hours under there with 
me we were definitely the last to get out of the  
water yeah so many fish down there like that was 
a real Wildlife Refuge also quite a bit of rain  
so glad that we're probably getting to the end of 
that right now but I think it is time for us to  
head back we've got one more Adventure coming 
up here that's going to be hopefully the most  
epic it's a new day we have new outfits and 
we have new ELO adventures and our adventures  
are going to start way up this hill it's a paved 
road but it's too steep of a road for our van to  
make it up here that's why we're walking and if 
there's one thing the kids love to do it's walk  
look at you guys this reminds me of the Ninja 
Village when we did that that tilted room you  
know it's going to be a really good day when 
you start off with that burning butt workout
feeling wait a minute what's going on here our 
trucks couldn't make it up Brooklyn may not be a  
big fan of hiking and climbing but when she does 
she almost always finishes first I'll go on the  
zipline first we are going to zipline but first a 
little poll who in this family has ever been zip  
lighting before show of hands does the N Village 
count nope no C zip lined in Bali I'm the only one  
who Z so we're going from being in the water to 
above the water we're going to go from one Island  
to another although it looks like the water level 
is low enough right now that technically these two  
bodies of land are connected how do we get back 
after we zip line I didn't think that far ahead  
I don't know this wasn't something we could book 
in advance it's first come first serve it looks  
like we're first cuz we got here right when it 
opens at 9:00 a.m. hello good morning so if we  
do one way how do we get back over here if you 
will take the two-way sir you will do zip line  
twice so from the landing area sir you need walk 
up heill first and then that is 120 steps before  
doing the other zip liner and going down you want 
to zip line down and then walk back or so you want  
to climb over there you're going to have to climb 
so either way we're climbing this mountain okay I  
guess we're doing two-way you going to go first 
babe M really really nervous about these kids uh  
I'm sure it's super safe because uh they do this 
all the time but when it comes to your babies it  
never feels good I feel so nervous like my stomach 
is turning oh my God it's going to be harder to  
watch them go than to do it [Music] myself excuse 
me before you make it to the end just put your  
head on like this and up your KN like this 1 
two oh oh my God it's so cool W wo oh my God  
that the coolest thing ever I'm so high oh my I 
think I'm stuck yeah I think I'm stuck I'm going

stuck that was one of the coolest things I got 
St oh my God I hope they're having fun I hope  
they're having fun but now I feel better knowing 
that they're safe this is working I just hope  
they're having a good time Brooklyn asked me if 
she could swear nobody can hear so I said go for  
it okay our [Music] [Applause] turn what do you 
think guys I like camera so you got stuck I got  
stuck I didn't make it I got okay there that

I loved it loved it loved it felt Totally Secure 
and like the The View you get up there and the  
the wind under you it was awesome I loved it I 
could do that over and over and over well good  
cuz you get to do it again now one more time 
after a little bit of a climb let's hi let's  
go to the next one it's it's like 140 steps to 
the next one is that right 120 steps to the next
one you got this baby almost there hey Dad can I 
go first round two we're going again still nervous

here and doing this experience do it will  
they regret it if they fall and die yes I 
see I see quot right there and he's stuck  
I think that's yeah yeah cuz it's like

doesn't have any luck I wonder if that means 
I'm going to get stuck too ready 1 two and
three I love you sweetheart a she itty [Music]
bitty I think I'm [Music] stuck hello notice I'm 
not going to die I have been rescued yay how fun  
what an adventure and guess what it's a school 
day and this is what we're doing this is what  
their classroom looks like they're so lucky what 
school subject would you say this one is geology  
science physics culture social studies I love this 
I Love This Life Adventure always ready one two
and wo she's crazy all right Big Daddy's turn
[Music]
[Music] and which one did you like better the 
first one or the second one uh first one first  
one cuz was longer yeah I think I like the second 
one better sitting upright you could actually see  
more I felt like I got more view better visual 
effect okay back where we started but now we  
have a downhill climb instead of an uphill climb 
so we're actually going to go down hereo still  
out of breath we're going to end up at the beach 
so beautiful we made it here's the beach [ __ ]  
straight to the water that actually didn't take 
very much time I think from very start to very end  
it's been less than an hour about 50 minutes to do 
both of the the zip lines brittle star it's like a  
little it's a mixture of an octopus and a sea star 
it's a sea star with the flexibility and energy  
of a starfish because they are very brittle Colt 
said that he saw a turtle while he was ziplining  
and I'm not surprised because this is known 
as a turtle Sanctuary so many different Turtle  
sanctuaries all over elnido but it's also named 
after that elnido translates to the nest meaning  
the turtle nest and that's why you'll see so many 
turtles here and Colt says he found something else  
too what did you find bud I found what I believe 
to be a gum boot a gum boot is like a sea slug  
feel that yeah it's rough on top he's got his foot 
on the bottom and that's how he moves around it's  
like a little suction cup like his full body I 
learned from him I love that I have a feeling  
I'm always going to be learning from him we're 
going to sit down and have a little something  
to drink because I think we've all learned it 
that was a great way to explore elnido I'm glad  
we finally made it back to Palawan and be able 
to compare and contrast this with coron Island  
it's really like a completely different trip to be 
honest with you but between island hopping and zip  
lining I would have to say I would prefer to do 
the island hopping again mainly because it means  
we can get in the water and cool off but what do 
you guys think what do you think babe it's so hard  
to say because I love love love the snorkeling 
in the Philippines it's really out of this world  
if you like the snorkeling you haven't been to 
the Philippines it's going to blow your mind so  
get here uh but the ziplining was so cool and it 
was different and unique like we've done island  
hopping in a lot of other countries as well but 
ziplining that was my first real ziplining except  
for this epic failure I had at a children's ninja 
Village are you what about you babe would you  
rather do the island hopping or the zip lining 
ziplining Cole you said island hopping why uh  
because the snorkeling is so amazing to see like 
the lobsters everything the crabs I you can find  
cool stuff too like like money I found money 
10 pesos treasure well we still have so much  
more to do in the Philippines we have about 6,990 
Islands left to explore here uh but we're off to  
another big city come tomorrow so stick with us 
make sure you subscribe we've got that meet and  
greet with Mom Duty coming up here so be sure to
