Romantic, old-fashioned girls in the Philippines
The times they are a'changing, of course.
Facebook and access to the internet has exposed
the
Philippines to changing moral values, yet
Filipina girls are mostly still old fashioned
romantics at heart.
Romantic Filipinas wherever you look.
Filipina girls and morality
I wrote an article recently about the decline
in morality in the Philippines amongst young
people, and I
stand by that.
Please read HERE if you haven't already done
so.
The 
Philippines used to be the bastion of
innocence.
If a girl wasn't married, good chance she
was still a virgin waiting on Mr Right to
come and
ask her parents if he may court her.
She would go on dates with you if she had
a chaperone with her,
and as long as her parents knew when she would
be home.
Since then?
Facebook and Nicki Minaj videos and Miley
Cyrus "discovering who she is" through
promiscuity.
These are the new role models, instead of
their virtuous mothers and grandmothers.
Let
me explain why I think this is sad, and also
why I think there's still hope.
Filipina girls are romantic
A "tough" attitude toward morality may well
work for some women.
There are tough women out there
in the world, no doubt.
Nicki and Beyonce are probably pretty tough.
But it is doomed to failure when
the girl is soft-hearted and romantic by nature,
and that's what the average Filipina girl
is.
I'm realizing lately that Filipina girls,
even the younger millennials (teens to maybe
mid to late 20's),
haven't actually changed much in essence.
The very fact that they still use the word
"courting" is a bit of
a hint.
In most cases?
Most Filipinas give their hearts once!
They fall for a chap, and they hang on for
dear life.
Bed-hopping and having sex as a "good way
to pass the time"?
Rarely!
Most girls fall head over
heels for a boy or man, and they can and will
love him for the rest of their lives.
How about the young men of the Philippines?
Is the average Filipino male a soft-hearted
romantic?
No.
No, sadly not.
And this is especially so when he's young
and at his most virile.
He's much the same as
any other teenage to mid 20's young men.
He's on the hunt, and he wants to populate
the world.
The
more the merrier.
And what could be better for him in this quest
than a large number of romantic
females who have new-found sexual freedom
and Miley in their ears singing "It's our
party we can love
who we want"?
And at the end of the day, are these girls
actually getting what they want?
Most of the ones I see are
ending up miserable, because the boys are
not in love at all.
They want sex, and they get sex by claiming
they're in love.
And the girls believe this.
And if the boys cheat on the girl and get
caught out?
They tell
the girl how sorry they are, and she forgives
them!
And it keeps on going until the girl joins
the
expanding (literally!) crowd of Filipina single
mothers.
Because these fine young men don't like using
condoms and the girls accept this!
The good thing about romantic Filipinas
You were probably wondering where I was going
with this.
Yes, I was having a bit of a rant because
I find
the whole thing sad.
Lovely girls trying out cool new ideas and
making themselves miserable in the
process.
And young men acting like animals with no
restraint because of this.
Boys have conquest stories
to tell, whilst girls get broken hearts.
What's the positive side?
The positive side is that a romantic girl
is a great catch for a decent man with a soft
heart, and that
describes most Australian men.
The average Aussie male is a fairly straight-forward
and often unrefined
sort of bloke, but with a kind and honest
nature.
And decades of rampant feminism have made
many of
us really crave a good woman who will treat
us with kindness and sweetness.
And once we find her, we
treasure her and will happily take care of
her.
Combine this with a romantic girl who wants
a knight in
shining armour to sweep her up, marry her
and build a family with her, and you have
a great
combination.
Keep treating her well, and that old-fashioned
and romantic nature will remain.
Always tell her you love
her.
Never stop "dating" with your wife.
And never forget how incredibly lucky you
are, and be sure to
tell her regularly.
Do this and you'll have many happy years.
