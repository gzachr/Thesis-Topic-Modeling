and we're going to start off
with the one
the only
lisa soberano
lisa savannah i heard of her oh yeah
lisa
i heard of her yeah on our past video
somebody said you look like her and you
were like no all right
i can't tell now she's way too predating
oh my god
oh my god how old is she
she's only 23 years old oh my god
she she's filipino american yeah i knew
she's a mix oh my god her facial
she's so pretty
i didn't know she was only 23 years old
oh my lord
good for her i wonder what the life is
be like to have this face
and the body you know i've heard like
you know people have
like good looks they they experience
things differently yeah and they get a
lot of things for free like a lot of
that stuff so i bet definitely i mean
you probably got a lot of stuff for free
too because of your face yeah but i love
lessons
i didn't get free cars so i mean imagine
me did i get anything for free never
but your personality is like almost
perfect so everybody's like always give
you deals and everything but they have
to know me first yeah but they could
just give it to her for free
okay
we get we all get candies when we are
little
all right next one
is one of the more iconic people she's
been in the game for a while now she's
an amazing actor she's an amazing singer
okay and her name is sarah
geronimo hello
i'm saying that's so weird but sarah
geronimo yeah oh wow
yeah okay she oh yeah she doesn't look
like filipino to me
but she's so beautiful she's so skinny
oh my god
you're skinny too babe
only my upper body but not my lower body
it's her yeah wow
she's gorgeous
yeah she she is let's see how old she is
actually because let's see how maybe
she's 33.
no wait she does not look like she's 33.
she looks like she's like early 20s
right yeah she looks so young
yeah
oh wow her skin is so nice maybe just a
makeup bus still
so nice very very nice um so she
actually sang one of my most favorite
she actually sang one of my favorite
songs i forgot what it was but i love i
love it when she sings because she has a
beautiful voice
um
but yeah okay next one one of my
personal favorites
miss kimchi kim chew yeah she is chew is
filipino in chinese okay i believe oh
wow
yes
oh she's so gorgeous
like i wonder
how they can maintain
their
their style eating filipino food
um it's probably a little bit of working
out i think a lot of these people work
out babe like you know they have time to
work out they enjoy they probably enjoy
working out um and you know when you
work out you can enjoy more foods
um but yeah i don't think i don't think
they eat filipino food all the time i
think they have like a nutritionist
maybe like somebody who helps them
correct me if i'm wrong but maybe
they're just naturally skinny like you
but yeah she
she has those asian beauty
yeah no she is
um but yeah i mean that's crazy right
she probably got
a lot of free stuff too
please give us a free again free stuff
