I'm going to be telling you 15 things I wish 
I knew before visiting the Philippines. The  
Philippines is one of the most beautiful 
countries in the world but it is not as  
easy to travel to compared to places like 
Thailand and Bali but don't worry I'm here  
to help you out and make sure you are super 
prepared for your trip to the Philippines!
If you don't know me I'm Joel and I've spent 
three months traveling the Philippines and it  
is honestly one of my favorite countries in my 
opinion it's got some of the best coral reefs  
and beaches in the entire world but let's start 
with number one and that is when to go so most  
of the Philippines dry season is from December 
to April however in shower gal it's a little bit  
different and it's from March to October the dry 
season often the most touristy time of the year  
so that's just something to keep in mind and know 
that there will be more tourists there but not as  
much rain so number two let's talk about local 
kind of transportation and how to get around  
because it's actually a little bit different 
from other Southeast Asian countries so number  
one you've actually got got Japanese and these 
are like really cheap big old American trucks  
where you can just jump in and they take you down 
a road Japanese are quite hard to navigate but if  
you ask the driver they can help you out also in 
the Philippines you get tricycles motorbike taxis  
which in Filipino they call Havel Hubble and then 
you also do have tuk-tuks in some places these are  
really good and cheap ways to get around like 
your local town or Village or get to your hotel  
also in major cities like Manila and Cebu then 
they actually have the grab app so you can order  
taxis on your phone I'm going to be talking about 
other transportation from buses ferries flights  
all of that stuff later in the video so stay tuned 
so number three is Health friendly and helpful the  
Filipino people are they are so hospitable they 
will help you out in any situation and also their  
English is incredibly good the best English I 
think anywhere in Southeast Asia even the children  
can speak lots of English and that's because they 
actually learn it in school so you can actually  
have conversations with them and they often like 
to practice their English too so number four is  
don't spend too long in Manila and Cebu these 
are big cities there's quite a bit traffic and  
honestly the best stuff is the island the beaches 
the coral reefs that's where the good stuff and  
that's where you should spend your time so number 
five is talking about SIM cards I personally use  
a Smart SIM card and I highly recommend it I had 
really good connection and you can actually top  
it up from your phone the other thing to use 
is an esin I've used two companies and that  
is Nomad and airlo and both of these have really 
good connection and good deals I've actually got  
discount codes for both of them so if you want 
to use them and get some money off your first  
esim then you can let's talk about transportation 
and if you didn't know the Philippines has over 7  
000 Islands which is partly what makes it so 
beautiful but also really hard to travel around  
obviously taking just buses is not possible 
you're gonna have to take ferries or flights  
and obviously flights is the most comfortable and 
the quickest way but it does cost more money the  
other way you can do it is take ferries and 
these are quite uncomfortable and can take  
quite a lot of time but they are cheap moving on 
to number seven I'm going to talk about booking  
Transportation because it is not as easy as any 
Travel Agency in Thailand in Thailand is so easy  
you can go anywhere ask a hotel and they'll book 
it for you however in the Philippines it's more  
difficult there's a couple of different ways 
it works sometimes you actually have to go to  
the pool and book your Ferry for tomorrow or that 
day or another way you can do it is actually use  
bookaway.com I've used these before and you can 
book online you can use card it is so good and  
then you don't have to go anywhere to physically 
book it I'll leave a link in the description to  
bookaway.com sometimes you actually have to go to 
the bus station and book your ticket just before  
you go or sometimes like a day in advance for 
ferries but it always changes the best thing to do  
is ask your hotel and hopefully they can help you 
out now moving on to number eight let's talk about  
a daily budget everyone wants to know how much is 
this trip going to cost me and it is honestly more  
expensive than other countries in Southeast Asia 
there are a few things which make the Philippines  
a little bit more expensive one of these is like 
the activities like the island hopping tours the  
canyoneering but also a lot of Backpackers tend 
to eat more Western food rather than Filipino food  
and honestly this costs more money you don't get 
big street food places like in Thailand or Vietnam  
and again this will make things cost more money 
use this as a little bit of a guide but I would  
budget at least 30 pounds a day minimum you can do 
it less than that but you're going to be eating a  
lot of local Filipino food and long Transportation 
Journeys also this 30 pound daily budget does not  
include flights so just keep that into account 
not internal flights around the country don't  
swim with the whale sharks in Oslob a lot of 
people do it still and honestly it is really  
not good for the whale sharks whale sharks should 
be migrating all the way around southeast Asia but  
they are just staying in this small town Oslo and 
that is because they're feeding them loads of fish  
every day and the whale sharks are vertical which 
makes it really bad because they're just feeding  
fish with their mouth out of the water honestly if 
you want to swim with whale sharks there are other  
beautiful places to visit in the Philippines like 
Donsol and another Island I've forgotten the name  
of do it naturally do it properly don't just 
give in to the mass tourism there are so many  
people swimming with whale sharks and it's just 
not good for them so moving on to number 10 let's  
talk about accommodation so there's hotels hostels 
guest houses but honestly compared to somewhere  
like Thailand or Bali you don't get as good value 
for your money for 20 pounds a night in Thailand  
you'll probably get a really nice hotel room but 
in the Philippines you won't get anywhere near  
that the way to do this is to stay in hostels 
or guest houses or pensions and these are a lot  
cheaper stays and I highly recommend them that's 
how we travel the Philippines cheaper two hostels  
I will recommend is Outpost hostel in Coron and 
then friends hostel in El Nido these hostels are  
amazing and I have swimming pools with amazing 
views just do it they're really good so number 11  
is renting a scooter in the Philippines honestly 
it's probably the best way of getting around most  
places and they normally cost 250 pesos to 400 
pesos a day depending on the time of year and  
availability and all that kind of stuff unlike 
in Thailand they probably won't make you deposit  
anything like your passport or cash and so you 
can just ride off but please wear your helmet  
you don't want to crash so number 12 is visas 
and entry requirements to the Philippines you  
actually don't need to do anything beforehand for 
most countries you get a free 30-day Visa stamp  
on arrival this is only for 30 days but you can't 
actually extend it if you want to at immigration  
offices I haven't done it myself but just look 
online and have a look for other people who have  
so number 13 is something I didn't know until very 
recently and that is service water is mandatory  
so if you're going into a restaurant or anywhere 
and you ask for service water you don't actually  
have to pay for that which is really good because 
it means you don't have to waste plastic and buy  
plastic bottles of water lots of the Philippines 
are really up to date with ecotourism no plastic  
and honestly they are so much better for the 
environment than other places like Thailand sorry  
Thailand so number 14 is all about the island 
hopping tours these are honestly some of the best  
days in the Philippines they are so much shine you 
basically get a boat and you go out to the islands  
eat whether you're in Coron, El Nido, Boracay or 
Siargao these are the best days you often get a  
big Buffet boodle fight lunch and you just eat 
your life out and then carry on with your island  
hopping day you can actually book these tours 
online and I'll leave a link in the description  
but you can also book them with like your hotel 
or hostel wherever you're staying so yeah do what  
you want however you feel now this is the last 
one and probably my favorite to tell you all  
about and that is where to go in the Philippines 
but before I do please hit the Subscribe button  
I've given you all this information for free just 
because I want you to go to the Philippines as I  
love it so much so please just hit subscribe it 
takes two seconds I'm gonna be giving you a one  
month action-packed itinerary for the Philippines 
this is going to be all the best places and let's  
start with panawam starting koron in the North 
and then head down to El Nido Port Barton and then  
go to Puerto Princesa and fly over to Cebu from 
Cebu go down to mobile do the Epic canyoneering  
and then go down to Siquijor Island this magical 
Island then head over to Panglao, Bohol see the  
Chocolate Hills and then head back to Cebu to fly 
over to Siargao the surf Island I'd spend a week  
there surfing there's also lots of activities to 
do which I mentioned in one of my other videos  
I'll leave down below that is your one month in 
the Philippines but two other highly suggested  
places to go is one camiguin Island which has 
this epic sandbar with this massive volcano  
in the background honestly it is beautiful and 
it's just a three hour Ferry arrived from Bohol  
so you can do that and the other place is really 
remote and that is Balabac Islands this is like  
the Maldives of the Philippines it is absolutely 
beautiful and there is hardly any tourists there  
so please don't tell too many people just go 
there experience it see the turtles see The  
Sandbar see this beautiful beautiful island yeah 
message me about it because it's epic I forgot  
couple of really important things which I forgot 
to mention in this video which I get asked quite  
a bit and the first one is about safety in the 
Philippines honestly we felt really safe most  
of the time even in Manila we well personally 
I really didn't feel threatened even though  
you hear these stories of being you know more of a 
dangerous city however Amelia experienced when she  
was by herself that it just wasn't quite as safe 
she got a lot more attention from the men when  
she was without me and so she just didn't want 
that attention but she never actually felt like  
physically threatened so that's just something to 
take into account if you are Solo female the other  
thing is you need travel insurance and Emilia and 
I use safety wing and I'll leave a link in the  
description make sure you covered before you come 
to the Philippines or anywhere on your travels
