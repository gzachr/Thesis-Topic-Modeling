This Cebuano food is what I was most curious about
It's a Tuslob buwa
Tuslob means Dip
Buwa means Bubble
So, it's a food that you dip rice in a soup with bubbles
I'm sure you'll be surprised when you hear the ingredients for the soup
This is Azul in Cebu
Azul's Tuslob buwa is 
different from the traditional ingredients
They added more ingredients to 
appeal to the younger generation
Traditional methods and key ingredients continue
It's become more familiar taste
Let's cook now
First, add Onions to the Oil
Then, add the Pork Liver
Next is the core ingredient of the Tuslob buwa 
Don't be surprised
It's the Pig's Brain
And Garlic
Egg
Stir-fry it
When the broth disappears
Add the Secret Sauce
And Soy Sauce
Chili powder
Lastly, add Fried Pork Skin Chicharon
It's done
「Half fear, half anticipation」
「He eats like a coward」
「😮」
It's delicious
Super delicious
「Unlike my worries, 
I was surprised because it was so delicious」
In a way, this is Cebu's style of fondue
Dip the hanging rice in hot soup
It's a kind of fondue style food
To explain the taste
In a way, it tastes similar to Korean instant ramen
Eggs, Chili powder, and Soy sauce
It's very savory and flavorful...
「It tasted familiar」
「And the spiciness was perfect」
I think... it's the most Korean-tasting dish in Cebu
It tastes really familiar
This is Deep fried pork fat called Kinupsan
「Crunch 😋」
「Korean Kimchi man is angry again today 😛」
「🤔」
「Delicious AF 😡」
This is a Chinese style dumpling
[ENG] Friend : Siomai... the name
「I'm thinking if it's good or not」
「a confusing taste」
I don't know, but the dumplings taste like tomatoes
 「Actually, it wasn't that interesting 
because it was a familiar dish」
It's very refreshing and delicious
「Broken reaction 🤣」
「Mealtime 😃」
「Non-stop munching 🤤」
「The Tuslob buwa began in Barangay Pasil, Cebu」
「The reason why Cebuanos used 
pig brains in this food is because」
「It's hard to get something to eat」
「It began by using left over parts such as pig brains in cooking」
「When I smelled it, it felt like makchang
(Korean Intestines food)」
「I think it affects the flavor」
So I tried the Tuslob buwa made of pig brain
I was afraid that it was made using pig brains
But when I tried it, I realized it was my prejudice
 It's interesting that the ingredients are similar to Korean food, 
so it tastes familiar
Along with the happiness of delicious food,
It was also fun to make it on my own
I hope you guys try it when you guys come to Cebu
