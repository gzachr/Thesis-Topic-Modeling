I'm on something new
Like every night on something new
They come out to play
Like every night it's someone new
Yeah I'm vibin', yeah I'm good
But they got somethin' to prove
Me, I'm on something new
Like every night on something
You can catch me with
my eyes low oh oh
I'm on something new,
I'm on something new
Eyes low, low
My baby hella bad in that baby blue
Eyes low low
My boys be going crazy,
yeah the ones they true
Eyes low, low
I'm on something new,
I'm on something new
Blessed and I got money
money I ain't fuckin' round
No we ain't fuckin' round goddamn
You know me I'm always making rounds
Whippin' round' the city goddamn
We at the fiesta 'bout to shut it down
Both my OGs lookin' down
both my OGs lookin' down
Heavy on the holy water when I'm on my
'can't talk right now muhfucka'
If the odds right I'ma put 10 down
just to double up the
stack right now mothafucka
Rollin' down 4 with
the windows rolled down
'Bout to run the city we
gon' hold our own ground
Graveyard circle, ghost ride money
Took way too many
goddamn I lost count like
I'm on something new
Like every night on something new
They come out to play
Like every night it's someone new
Yeah I'm vibin', yeah I'm good
But they got somethin' to prove
Me, I'm on something new
Like every night on something
You can catch me with my
Baby fleece you know I'm smooth
You know I got the juice
Got the juice like
Baby fleece, you know I'm smooth
You know I set the mood
You set the mood, you set the mood
Sippin' on that youth
water, we'd never age
We'll never fade out
Never tamed she don't behave now
Never change until the grave
My eyes low
low, low
I'm on something new,
I'm on something new
Eyes low, low
My baby hella bad in that baby blue
Eyes low low low
My boys be going crazy,
yeah the ones they true
Eyes low, low

Na na na na
If you new around here roll thru like
Na na na na
Throwin' all this paper out here
Had to blow a whole stack
Still I give back
Had to give back to the
real real ones since day one
Always held me down
had my back now we on
I'm on something new
Like every night on something new
They come out to play
Like every night it's someone new
Yeah I'm vibin', yeah I'm good
But they got somethin' to prove
Me, I'm on something new
Like every night on something
You can catch me with my eyes low
Low, low
I'm on something new,
I'm on something new
Eyes low, low
My baby hella sexy in that baby blue
Eyes low low low
My boys be going crazy,
and that's just how we do
Eyes low, low
These stacks they hella
