Adobo is an iconic Filipino dish that we usually cook with either pork or chicken,
and it's stewed in a marinade of soy sauce and vinegar.
We're gonna start off by sauteing half a large onion, and then six cloves of garlic.
Afterwards throw in about two and a half pounds of pork butt, and
sear the sides a little bit to give the dish more depth of flavor.
Then go ahead and add half a cup of vinegar,
1/3 of a cup of soy sauce,
2/3 a cup of water, 1-2 bay leaves,
1/4 of teaspoon of black pepper,
1/4 of teaspoon of basil,
1/4 a teaspoon of oregano and half a teaspoon of brown sugar.
Next simmer everything for a 70 minutes and then bada bing bada boom! You have yourself a talagang tasty pot of
Pork Butt Adobo! Then as always plate it next to a scoop of rice and pour a little bit of the sauce and let's eat!
Pro tip: It always tastes better the next day!
