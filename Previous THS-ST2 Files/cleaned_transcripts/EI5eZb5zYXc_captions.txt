and in the snacks this doesn't really qualify 
as a snack but it's called banana banana  
sauce this is banana ketchup i actually 
had that recently and i quite enjoy it  
magic cheese flavored magic flake 
crackers never had them before
my own personal brand of chips marty's crackling 
plain salted vegetarian chicharron old-fashioned  
style chips that was a breath oh oh oh oh oishi 
whishy prawn crackers spicy flavor boy bawang  
cornet corn nick chili cheese flavor looks like 
little corn nut things and lobster crackers
this all for the challenge
hi everybody and welcome back to another video 
of the canadian traveler so like we talked about  
in the last video i am doing a challenge it's 
a an easy challenge it's a fun challenge but  
for one whole day i am going to eat and drink 
nothing but filipino food and filipino drinks  
you saw the last video we were at the 
filipino grocery store or supermarket  
so everything we bought there we now have 
at home like magic somehow everything just  
ended up cooked and on the table and this is 
everything that we have and what do we have
and what's all in there um egg blend
um shrimp shrimp yeah yeah that shrimp and okra 
and long green beans or string beans so mix of  
we call this radish i don't know what you called 
it here but we call that radish okay so it's a  
mix of vegetables and seafood yeah well that looks 
really good and over here of course rice rice okay  
who's this nice looking guy that's a fried tilapia 
fried tilapia kind of fish pretty pretty pretty  
nice looking fish that's a saltwater fish yes yes 
okay and to be followed up with another saltwater  
friend i call that butter garlic butter shrimp 
garlic butter shrimp that's a mouthful right  
beside it this is again silicone maybelline okay 
so i'm a little confused with what this is here  
so that's for the fried tilapia perhaps oh for the 
fried tilapia this is ketchup ketchup and slices  
soy sauce with calamansi which is a little fruit
so we don't have the actual calamansi 
fruit here this is the alternative it's  
it's concentrated calamansi juice that's a 
picture of the fruit it's a very it's a citrus  
fruit it's very small and that's what we get 
here in canada now in the philippines it would be  
this it would be that actual fruit and 
you would squeeze it into this okay  
let's give this a try this looks really 
good okay so i'm going to start with some  
siligon which is basically shrimp soup if if i 
think i could call it that hmm that's almost got  
a citrusy type taste to it as well it's uh 
a real mix of flavors i uh put the cinnamon
just a really nice taste that kind of hits you 
in the back of the tongue and says eat more  
it's really good like a sour a sweet and sour 
at the same time that might be a good okay so  
i take some of this fried tilapia like that 
dip in what if i should okay try it without
it's not as strong tasting as i thought for a 
saltwater fish i thought it would have been more  
more of that ocean flavor but that's actually 
almost tastes like a a fresh water fish that's  
actually very nice i like that how do you 
explain what fish tastes like you cut it okay  
so i'm going to try it with the soy sauce
that's a really nice flavor first of all the fish 
is fantastic you get that salty of the calamansi  
or the kind of the soy sauce but that citrus 
of the calamansi comes popping right through  
and it really gives it that philippine taste that 
anyone who's been to the philippines would know  
exactly what i'm talking about so i only had 
a bit of a little piece off because i wanted  
to save some for the ketchup or the ketchup 
ketchup no that tastes like fish with ketchup  
i i prefer it with the soy with calamansi 
but with the ketchup is also very nice  
um i've already had some cinnamon 
i'm going to save the shrimp for  
a little bit more in a little bit but if this 
is the start of the challenge i say bring on the  
next day because this is going to be awesome 
good morning everybody in keeping with our  
challenge it's kind of a 24-hour challenge 
of only filipino food we're also going to  
go with filipino drinks and this is i love 
cappuccinos so i'm having filipino-style coffee  
and there's just enough in here for a small 
cup and since i've got a big cup i've got two  
little packets or sachets so it comes with a 
little chocolate sprinkle i guess if you will
get it over the bottom so i 
don't need to mess with myself
and we pour it in it's all 
pre pre-measured pre-packaged
the hot water in there
to make it fancy
little packets of chocolate powder if you will and
there you go filipino style 
coffee cappuccino for breakfast
cut that for a minute this besides looking like 
a bun is panda cell so panda cell is normally  
well common with breakfast um i've had pandas all 
before i've never actually done a specifically way  
which is to take out your bun or your panda cell
and with your coffee dip your pandas all 
into the coffee which i've never done before
hmm enjoy pandasal and coffee 
for breakfast philippine style  
enjoy thank you so now it's time for me 
to try all this yummy filipino food so  
naturally we're gonna start 
with some bungas some milk fish
we're just trying little bits and 
i'll have some rice oh either this one
because we can't have a meal without rice 
in the philippines they eat rice at least  
three times a day sometimes more 
sometimes more if they want a snack
and we'll try some bulad and an egg to 
make which this is how we cook thing  
okay okay so this bongos for here and 
this one is in true filipino style  
i'll eat with my fingers this is not 
considered rude in the philippines so
bonus
i love that soy sauce with the this that bongles 
is really good it's one of my favorite fish  
probably in the world so that's 
a two thumbs up okay so this is  
the dried squid and we'll dip it into here now 
normally i think you would eat this with the rice  
at the same time but i'm sure yeah yeah i'm just 
gonna try a bite crispy vinegary peppery mommy
mess it up delicious
it's hard to explain but i could eat that any day  
just because this can't eat alone right no 
dipping it no no dipping up just start with rice
duh sweeter sausage sweet good  
i'm doing the frogs in the philippines 
i should be eating with my spoon there
good if you've never eaten filipino 
food definitely worth uh finding  
somewhere that that serves filipino 
food i'm trying it out for yourself
an awesome meal i'm definitely 
enjoying this 24 hour challenge  
like i said if you have the opportunity 
to try filipino food it's well worth it  
so first off i'm thirsty so i'm 
going to try this vocal pen done
hmm it's thick kind of minty kind of 
yummy it's got little gelatin in it  
yeah very minty i like that this is not 
as thick sago at gulaman kuleman gulaman
well that's also the chunks of gelatin in it  
but i can't say what that tastes like other 
than it's cold and it's thirst quenching okay  
what should i try next you tell me you 
should try the bacon but you need spoon  
let's try the be cool but i need spoons so 
you point at the biko tada a spoon shows up
all right
so
this is rice right yeah rice cake
kind of a glutinous rice sticky rice almost 
has a maple type taste but it's the brown sugar
that's good if you got a sweet tooth that'll 
definitely hit that spot it's more like a dessert  
dessert snacks
okay sesame balls or buchi a little ball
hmm a chocolate in the middle what's 
inside chocolate i think you want to  
keep it with chocolate everybody no 
you had uh white oh obi inside maybe
that's good not too sweet
but definitely worth trying
so continuing on i'm going to try mang pedro's  
fried pork rinds so pretty sure exactly as it 
sounds it's pork and it's little rings chicharron
that's good with vinegar 
garlic flavor i like garlic
those are tasty
then we're gonna head over to 
marty's marty's plain salted  
vegetarian so these are 
chicharron as well same as these
different shapes chicharron okay
vegetarian kitchen
they remind me of something i mean but they are 
sun chips that's what these remind me of sun chips  
perfect to drink with a nice tall soft drink or 
one of these because that'll make you thirsty
and i'm saving well it's not bad best for last 
but so these are spicy flavored prawn crackers  
and they look like french 
fries little french fries
it's brown they're not spicy though oh wait
wait a second yeah if you eat a few of 
them they start to get a little hot on  
the back of your tongue but they're nice 
i almost have a ketchup flavor to them  
like the ketchup flavored chips it's 
almost what they taste like to me but  
yummy i'm moving to the philippines tomorrow 
because these are all really good snacks
so these are magic flakes cheese 
flavored crackers oh it's a cracker
with a very cheesy flavor that's nice
very good
10 out of 10 on the philippine snacks which
