Good evening. Good evening my friends and welcome 
to another video here in the beautiful country  
of the Philippines. We are going to be heading over 
to one of the largest malls in the Philippines and  
the world we're going to be going all the way to 
this insane mall but first we need to figure out  
how we're gonna get there so I was distracted for 
a second guys we got a tuk-tuk here and we've got  
a a lot of traffic coming this way I will tell 
you we just spent the last 20 minutes trying  
to find a taxi and sometimes at night it's so 
busy it's hard to find a spot so I'm not sure  
how we're gonna get there yet but we're definitely 
going to get there by some mode of transportation  
whether it's uh cuckoo or a taxi or something 
we're here with Yad we're here with Walid but  
Wally's going to be dipping out you guys there 
you guys will see him for like 10 seconds yep  
yeah yeah and uh yeah and I are taking on 
this mall oh look at this guy over there  
this guy over there looks like he really 
wants to take us somewhere hello brother
I can't tell if he wants to say hi 
or what all right brother take care  
take care good night man all 
right see you bro Mall of Asia  
over there salamat kuya all right guys it looks 
like we got pointed in the right direction  
literally we're going to be going to the other 
side of the street and that's where we can get  
ourselves a ride to the Mall of Asia the nice 
part is those kind of taxis over there tuk-tuks  
they're actually shared so you can travel for a 
very cheap price rather than booking your own uh  
for example and you can make it uh long distances 
while I think they can hold up to like six seven  
people two or three rows in the tuk-tuk so it's 
really a cloud sufficient way to get around oh we  
got traffic coming in salamat hello brother how 
are you we got the shared taxi over to the mall
oh wait Mall of Asia okay okay yeah great guys 
again oh that's gonna be tied for two of us yeah  
uh this is our guy right here yeah hello brother 
uh how much for Mall of Asia right here okay  
perfect yeah our man was giving us the bike until 
next time all right jump in here you want front
come on The Mall of Asia
brother okay Mom
umero nice to meet you at Mero my name is 
Mac Okay so we've got a nice nighttime Cruise  
we're going to be taking guys probably 20 30 
minutes to get us over there and about six  
uh just under six US dollars to get over 
there and seat belts on for safety let's do  
let's do it you guys we have a uh wild 
one let's see if we're gonna catch her  
this that jeep they might be gone 
though the girls hanging on the bed
Philippines
all right guys we are arriving to the 
mall right now and this place looks  
massive honestly this looks like we're at 
an airport you see on the left like you  
have this like walkway bridge and then you 
see like a bunch of restaurants and people  
hanging out here getting picked up and 
like multiple Lanes to get dropped off  
and picked up that just goes to show you how 
massive and absolutely massive is a better  
way to explain it this place is so let's 
head on in there and see what it's like
thank you very much have made it my friends to 
the mall guys this place is so lit up here we are  
going to head right in and see what it's all about 
as you can see this place is packed with so many  
people right now we've got a fountain right here A 
bunch of locals just hanging out and a lot of the  
holiday spirit welcome to the mall my friends look 
at this we've got a few levels of the mall here  
we've got Shake Shack oh bro 
have you ever had Shake Shack  
it's so freaking good it's literally like 
one of the best chains but you know we're  
in the Philippines I don't think we 
can eat the uh Shake Shack right now
I see why they call it the Mall of 
Asia my friend this is insane I bet  
you can find every single brand that at 
least legally is sold in the country of  
the Philippines here we've got guests 
we've got bench we've got Tire we've  
got oh Johnny B over there we've got Chow 
King a little bit of everything kamusta
hello brother
okay long that's pretty good Tagalog yeah yeah 
thank you thank you thank you all right so we've  
got Dairy Queen here guys it feels like we're 
home back in the United States with all the  
good stuff we've got KFC right behind it and 
this is fantastic all right guys we're gonna  
actually go up to the next floor see what 
we're gonna find up there because it's a  
lot of like clothing stores creams and look at 
this multi-level Merry-Go-Round this is how you  
know it's a big mall you have a spiral staircase 
to get up to the top Toy Kingdom bring the kids  
here and then you got donuts good that looks 
delicious okay we've got the next floor we've  
got Zara up here Marx and Spencer Cinnabon 
and testing it out we got an espresso here  
guys we're on the top level and we're gonna head 
towards the food court our number one objective  
right now is to locate a spot for some coffee 
as you can see my eyes are a bit tired but uh  
let me just tell you it looks like bro right 
when we walk up there cha cha mu what is that  
chai and coffee all right what do we got going 
on here coffees hopefully we got Thai coffee  
oh yeah we got iced coffee some great options 
there Samosa that's gonna be good oh I think  
you already ordered oh line starts here yeah okay 
hello can I please oh good I'm very good very good
jet nice to meet you my name is Matt 
my accent's pretty bad in Tagalog yeah  
yeah what's up what's a good uh coffee you 
recommend that'll wake me up because I'm tired  
Thai coffee okay one Thai coffee please
I can pay with Carter Cash Only no problem
okay I'm getting a delicious Thai coffee bro 
she said it's gonna wake me up it's very very  
yeah very very nice very nice bro very nice when I 
have one please all right I'll pay for both please
oh perfect that's a great 
price salamat and these are  
the top 10 best sellers the Thai tea is up there
oh thank you so much I'm excited 
to have a maserat Thai coffee
he's going bro these are the best sellers Thai 
tea milk green tea but you're right that's  
number three in line that thing looks like 
a an absolute dessert that's gonna be great  
look at how many places they're already in 
here we gotta we gotta find some delicious  
stuff over here so hungry right now yeah I'm 
starving okay let's check the receipt I don't  
think there is are these uh Thai coffees brother 
Thai coffee food thai coffee thank you thank you
Jason that's a great name Jason nice to meet you 
nice to meet you thank you all right we're gonna  
go ahead pop these things right in there and we're 
gonna see if we can drink this thing right down
oh wow that's great guys we had to sit down 
for this one because let me just tell you  
that's a nice one I was actually about to slam it
I was like you know what I'm gonna enjoy 
this this actually probably reminds me of  
in the US you can get like 
canned coffee that's like Nestle  
and it has more of like you know the canned one 
it doesn't taste very fresh this one tastes like  
that type that flavor of coffee yet much fresher 
so I mean I like a lot I'm not gonna say it's  
my favorite coffee that I've ever had but it's 
like uh super super tasty and it's more unique  
I would relate it to more of like a sweeter 
milkier type of coffee probably a fair amount  
of sugar in here but yeah nonetheless I'd say 
it's quite good I'm not sure like if they call  
it Thai coffee because there's special ways 
they make the coffee that are specifically like  
mirroring the Thai way in Thailand but uh tastes 
delicious let me tell you that so here we go
let's finish that thing off 
here we go all right ready
oh my God I want it oh there's still a little 
there's still some left call that a win bro
I call that a proper win winner winner
all right so that was a nice coffee to get us 
going guys we're back with the energy we need  
honestly I feel a million times better now 
as you probably saw when I first walked on  
that Vlog I was like hello guys no not that bad 
but I was uh definitely drained a bit so we are  
gonna head down this way and find what else 
we can do in this mall it's honestly so big  
that like I don't even know where to start I 
still haven't really figured out what's the  
organization of this mall there's just kind 
of like a bit of everything on every floor  
but maybe there's just different segments that 
are set up like that different feel to them all  
then so guys this ball is so big we gotta like 
walk outside of this part of the mall and then
we're gonna cruise on that way
I don't think he's good to the right yeah 
oh that smells good bro I don't know if  
we're gonna make it to that massage 
place smelling this type of stuff  
it looks like we've even got some maybe food 
carts down there too it won't have to check out
oh hello

you we're doing a little scrub first of all 
of the leg here cleaning them off nicely
we've got one foot going up
we got some green tea cream going on there
oh that's nice that's really nice
I think those feet are gonna be ticklish
oh nice and clean there
oh that's nice sometimes you don't 
realize how dirty the lights can  
be until you get a proper cleaning 
oven it's like an exfoliating type
oh it's a little ticklish
oh in between the toes got me bro
foreign
water basically taking off 
the layer of exfoliation  
so great all right we got them dried off now
great oh so now we're putting on some sort 
of like uh stuff on it feels really good it's  
got like a cold feel to it oh that's nice oh 
that's gonna get basically that bottom layer
oh wow
like a basically a light sanding 
to the bottom a bit more rough  
calloused areas it's gonna make 
them like soft cuddly Feet Again
she's sawing some stuff off your feet 
over there bro I've got a lot of dead  
skin bro yeah yeah taking it off it's been 
a while since you had that it's been a while
still a little bit ticklish 
but definitely more doable um
wow so you guys can see how much is coming 
off there there's a lot of dead skin that  
was on there it's just all right what 
kind of building up around these days  
that's how bad I needed that all right now 
we're getting the uh nail cut as the last step
let's run pretty much like the last kind of 
phase which is filing just finished trimming  
the nails pushing the cuticles done and it's 
uh really relaxing yeah it's not used to this  
feeling so he's uh tweaking out he's like 
the weirdest feeling in the world guys I  
hate anyone like cutting anyone anymore [Music] 
for me my toes are just like ah take me down  
yeah you're getting a little like creamer liquid 
going in there because he cleans it up a bit  
to finalize the cuticles over there oh the 
best part we got the uh massage at the very end
The Best For Last is this uh my feet 
are feeling so clean so refreshed
it's a really nice process here
welcome sir
that's a nice one really nice 
tactic bam you see that bro  
yeah it's like I want to get beat up a little bit
[Music]

cleanest my feet have ever been

goodbye all right we are feeling fantastic
all right wow whoa I feel like I'm walking on like 
water right now oh that is fantastic I feel like  
you're walking on the moon and like I'm walking on 
water right now or something like it's it's next  
level head up this way so it looks like we've 
got an arcade up this way or something game on  
what do you think hungry your food food first 
all right maybe we'll come back to the arcade  
guys and let's see what we're gonna come across so 
guys we entered in this other part of the mall and  
there's a lot of like food stands here we've got 
oh yeah that's our guy hello MC we've got Turkish  
kebabs there and we have oh a lot of fries there 
hello and let's see lots and lots of bubbles here  
I will tell you you can go anywhere in Manila and 
you can find a plethora a crazy amount of bubble  
tea stands everywhere and so we're looking for 
something delicious to eat I think we need to go  
back to the other mall or find wherever the food 
court is in this one but we're gonna take you guys  
with for a little walking tour as we go through 
here and see I mean you can find everything we  
have air fresheners here we've got jewelry 
there we've got more jewelry there and even  
some cakes there bro oh my belly doesn't need it 
but my my uh mine is definitely asking me for it  
best ate cake in town motorcycle helmets wow 
this mall literally has everything guys I'm  
walking through and some of the best smells 
I feel like I've ever smelled in my life
that one smells good
incredible and uh how much are these
oh the Machine
2500 which is 40 is oh includes oil and this 
the smell I'm smelling it's all the same smell
and how long does one bottle last
okay one month wow this is very tempting that's 
um okay these are cheaper then but today it did  
it oh 1850 yeah I'm kind of tempted to buy one 
they do look nice the question is if is this  
is this an international product because I live 
on the other side of the world so yes sir okay
wow where's he at I gotta ask Yad if he thinks I 
should buy it yad you think I should buy it bro
I'm tempted to buy it bro this smells incredible 
yeah these are good bro I had one oh you did  
yeah they do they do smell really good for a long 
time yeah yeah and how much is this specific one  
2750 2750 so fifty dollars and then I would 
need some oil how much is an extra bottle of oil
550 okay so that's where they make 
the money on the oil then yeah
oh that's so good I can just 
imagine this in my apartment
that's a different sign yeah
oh I feel like this one more reminds me 
of my apartment one is more importantly
that's so nice I need to buy it I need 
to I'll take one yeah I'll take this one  
let me just test the smells again
but that one's kind of more of a softer smell yeah
oh that's so good yeah I'll take this one that's 
that's a great one second one uh yeah yeah  
that one with the same smell guys this was 
the most spontaneous purchase I have ever  
made in my life I just smelled 
but I was walking through and  
I was like this literally smells so 
good it just put me in a great mood
Marie that's a very nice name Marie so 
Marie just gave me the full rundown on  
this and uh there are a bunch of 
different scent machines that have  
all of these different flavors and smells 
I think probably it smells so good here  
because you have a hybrid of all of these 
going at once so it's a nice uh place to be  
working in the mall it smells good so it's 
a good place to be working right here yeah
you look beautiful black or 
oh it's a remote then yeah  
oh perfect so we can turn it on and off so I can
meet okay all right one okay one yeah one plug 
yeah and uh oh that's good it's a US plug one  
oh that's great wow wow and so one bottle 
I can put it in there and I believe it on  
24 hours it's only one pound oh one 
cap yeah one Cap all right that'll do
240 milliliters of water so the cap 
half the cap mixes in there yeah
oh okay one cap yeah and once every 24 hours no
eight hours okay so just during the day oh that's 
very nice oh so you can even turn that thing oh  
yeah oh we're remote control there bam let's go 
a little mood lighting yes and then this one is
and otherwise it just goes like this
is a different color okay oh different colors 
too oh that's perfect that is awesome whoa
guys I never knew how much I loved something that 
smells so good but like I'm just imagining like  
walking in especially in the winter time smelling 
the sweet smell in a warm cozy apartment that's  
nice guys there it is we've got this one and then 
we've got a small bottle that came with it and a  
big bottle oh yeah so the big bottle I guess it 
lasts like over two months so that's huge Mexican  
oh it's smelly things bro I literally came over 
here and I was like this is the best of all I've  
ever smelled in my life I'm literally buying 
this the most spontaneous thing I've ever done  
but absolutely worth it Marie's hooking us up four 
thousand oh perfect okay thank you so much see you  
okay we are looking at a proud new owner of 
a what do you even calling air smoke machine  
smoke machine or like scent machine so yeah 
this is uh like I said the most spontaneous  
thing I've ever bought in my life but as soon 
as I smell that smell walking through I was like  
this just made me feel great I'm getting 
it oh yeah and the total cost was about 4  
000 uh Filipino pesos which comes out to like 
70 but like I said I got one of those extra  
huge bottles that last a couple months I got 
the Free bottle the smaller one that lasts a  
month and then I got the machine so I'd say 
that's a pretty good price I don't know what  
they go for online I probably could have checked 
on Amazon but it was one of those things where I  
was like I smelled this one I'm buying this exact 
model right now all right now it's time to go try  
some food out I think we're getting close because 
the smells that I'm smelling now they're not the  
machine anymore now this is some delish Cinnabon 
right there oh yeah exactly desserts first or last  
bro you tell me I have uh during exactly during a 
little bit of all of it so let's go up here this  
is going to be the easy way to get up to the 
top there you're trying to go ice skating bro  
okay oh you don't know how there's a 
full-on ice skating rink that's crazy  
oh my God guilt what is it Guiltless 
goodness oh we've got desserts this way bro
oh it's so good it's worth the extra calories  
so they call this the Moa Food Hall and we're 
gonna have to see what we come across nothing  
brings people together like good food certified 
facts my friends certified facts and they have  
some like cool designs in the seating here and 
uh it's busy I mean almost every single table  
in this whole area is filled right now so let's 
see what are we gonna have for dinner oh Mexican  
here in the Philippines that could be tempting 
bro they've got tacos here some talk daddies  
are you in uh-huh yeah I know it I read that from 
afar bro that's certified bags tacos tacos tacos
oh yes what are you thinking bro you down 
for tacos yeah yeah I saw those from a mile  
away kamosa kakuyo okay okay oh look at this 
so we've got street tacos we got hard tacos  
burritos burrito bowl cheese enchiladas 
or cheese encha dank less bro for cheese  
no street tacos I think yeah oh yeah you can't 
go or they got bundles broke you're trying to  
Triple down uh let's see let's see bro well I 
like the design of the Russians we got tacos  
versus burritos and a nice Mexican painted wall 
so that looks good vamos aquamer we're going to  
eat they've got Burgers here too honestly that 
burger looks fantastic as well but uh I'm gonna  
see if they have quesadillas if they do I'm 
probably gonna get like two pieces of chicken  
idea of pork asada sounds good too foreign
okay I'm gonna probably ask some of the 
same questions because I couldn't fully  
hear but what's the most popular item on 
the menu the birio yes sir and what is it
oh cheese onions and mixed beef okay 
so you recommend doing this set yes  
and can I have for the drink Corona
oh that sounds like the perfect plan then
yeah you know it means what's your name
that's a very nice name nice to meet you
sir
okay that sounds perfect 780. 
all right the man the myth the  
Legends taking care of it the bread 
we're calling him the bread King I'm  
uh the bakery yeah the bakery exactly 
he's got all the cash in there and uh
all right this is going to be delicious guys I 
will tell you I didn't I know I didn't expect to  
be in Mexican food in the Philippines but it's 
some of the best yeah yeah I'm excited enjoy  
it it's a maserat here ayos ayos all right hello 
we're gonna be uh taking a spot maybe right over  
here you guys we've got the table right here and 
we can actually see the preparation they've got  
nachos in there honestly if I was like here two 
hours ago and I wasn't going to bed in the next  
couple hours I would probably order like the 
tacos and like maybe the burger as well as the  
burrito just like taste test it all because 
I freaking love Mexican food it is probably  
up there are my top three favorite Cuisines and 
look at that the prep is happening right there  
oh yes oh look what we've got here the delish 
stuff whoa oh almost lost it all yeah well that  
changed everything look at this these are massive 
oh bro there's no way I'm gonna have any room in  
my stomach after this holy crap guys so I wasn't 
planning on having any beers tonight but I decided  
I must because we're having Mexican food and what 
goes well with Mexican food a Mexican beer called  
Corona if you're not familiar with it and right 
here look at this guys it looks like we've got  
like shredded beef in there we've got like some 
cheese that's clumped up in a different type of  
way onions and the nice part is we have gloves so 
I can actually like pick around my food to show  
you what's on the inside and I've honestly never 
heard of this and I've eaten a lot of Mexican food  
so I wonder if this is like just common in certain 
parts of Mexico or if this is like a filipino's  
take on making I guess it's almost similar to a 
quesadilla the way it's cooked like At first look  
you might think that's a quesadilla but it tastes 
different and then you got some dipping sauce in  
there but I'm gonna have mine first without the 
dipping sauce just a good idea of what it's like
wow that is really good the beef or the uh it's 
shredded beef in there right yeah yeah super chewy
I Won't Say I'm excited to try it with this sauce 
because you know when it comes to Mexican food  
you're always dipping it into something 
you put that right in there okay dripping
I did not expect this that 
is really good I'm trying  
to figure out what that is normal it's like um
more of like an Asian Sauce I would 
say sauce mix a unique flavor but  
it goes well it really adds a lot of 
like juiciness right inside of there
and everything I'm a soft shell lover yeah it's 
got this nice crunch over there on his uh Taco  
that is so good and it looks incredible yeah but 
I like I like the uh the tortilla to be nice and  
chewy versus you know the hard shell version 
but really good oh you got extra sauces too  
is that like a green one yeah oh okay smart 
man do like the sauce but I'd say probably I  
would more try and commonly go with a like 
salsa and that's like a salsa right there
green sauce on there
and that is a match made in heaven right there 
so freaking good guys that is g triple o d uh  
guys I literally just annihilated that 
the first one it took me a little bit  
longer the egg sounds explaining it 
but then I put the camera down ate  
the other one in probably like four bites 
that's how good it was I love Mexican food  
Monday I'm gonna go back to Mexico and I'll 
share some of my favorite recipes over there
overall I would say great Mexican food especially 
being here on the other side of the world
I said like since that was like a type 
of Mexican food like the beer or however  
it's called that I've never had hard for me to 
compare it directly but a lot of the flavors are  
similar but it had a bit of a Filipino 
twist which is nice that was maseratio
and office thank you that was fantastic and 
I think we paid like just for mine 300 so  
that comes up to like six bucks right here 
in the mall so you know typical a slightly  
more expensive prices because you're in a you 
know nice fancy mall like this we got pizza ULU  
I don't know if I have any room in the belly but 
it seems like yeah it's got his mind set on this  
look at how good that looks though
all right yeah I'm down I'm down bro all 
right so we're gonna get dessert but we  
just found this pizza place it's like 
a party that looks freaking delicious
yeah yeah oh yeah yeah we've got a nice 
little I feel like we're in Tulum now

table out here is just like popped up with people  
so here we go lay sucre lab over there the 
sugar lab Earl of Sandwich oh is this guilty  
pleasure over there guilty pleasure oh yeah

to fill these bellies up with something good
all right all right hello hello
red velvet's good okay all right so 
it looks like oh Mini Chocolate Dream

this video that's quite small though I  
think I'm gonna go with that size I don't 
want yeah oh yeah okay me as well though
dream cake we'll make that uh two 
Mini Chocolate Dream cakes please
and it's which one's better the Mini 
Chocolate Dream cake or the Guiltless
oh okay let's put it this way I want 
to be guilty I need mine with sugar
normal's good yeah perfect all right there you go
Jamie Jade nice to meet 
you Jade that's a nice name
370. all right we got money bags taken 
over because foot massage was on me that  
means uh dinner's on the king and 
we have it all right the bread man
so Guiltless means there's no sugar
so they're so cold oh they are Frozen Frozen 
all right so it's like ice cream in there just  
chocolate oh just a cake chocolate 
is it hard to eat when it's frozen
uh no bag no bag thank you 
though no sugar oh there it is  
so much okay here we go 
we've got a spot right here
it is time to enjoy the delicious dream cake Hello 
there all right let's see how we open this thing  
label down oh that just pulls it right off there 
hey just pull that little orange label and you're  
in business guys so I was kind of surprised that 
it was frozen but that oh look at that oh we it  
just jumped out I was trying to show you guys oh 
okay it is time guys I just put the spoon right  
in there so when she said Frozen I thought it was 
like frozen frozen but you put like the spoon in  
there and it's like it's like uh yeah explain 
it perfectly it's like a cold chocolate lava  
cake with the texture so it's gooey but it's not 
like as drippy as obviously like hot lava cake  
but the texture on it looks great I'm gonna try 
out the oh so the top is unsweetened cocoa powder  
so I'm gonna be interested with how that blends in 
because let's put it this way this isn't the guilt  
this chocolate one this is the full-on guilty 
one which means it's loaded with sugar so we're  
gonna get a hefty scoop there we gotta make sure 
the first bite counts and we're gonna try it out
that is so so good you guys I want to 
try and explain this to you so like  
different parts of the cake has a different flavor 
to it so the top layer of like the fudge kind of  
tastes like a cold pudding that maybe your grandma 
might make the bottom is like more of like uh your  
typical what you find like a cupcake or a normal 
cake and then at the very top that hard shell is  
like a piece of like very thin layer hard 
chocolate on top so when you bite into this  
you're getting like a gooey texture you're 
getting a crunch from that hard chocolate and  
then you're getting the chew from that 
cake like uh texture right in there so
it is so freaking good let me tell 
you this we went to uh like a couple  
different places around here and we picked 
the right one it's a little cake like that  
and this is the small one it's meant for 
one person and it's a nice size dessert  
and they came out to like 200 to about four 
dollars for one of these in the mall almost  
the same price we paid for the tacos but when 
you got a cake like this looking that good  
well let's put it this way there's a reason why 
they call it the dream cake foreign guys I'm  
very sad this is literally the last bite but 
it is a massive one we're gonna make it count
phenomenal I give that a 10 out of 10. 
mother up very very delicious iOS cakes  
we'll be back again greatest 
desserts in the whole Mall
thank you very much guys unbelievably delicious I 
am a very happy man so yeah guys that was a trip  
to this incredibly large mall I do want to tell 
you guys that was just a small percentage of it  
I mean I just walked outside right here and we 
have electronic stores we have home stores we  
have Ace Hardware Stores we have got literally 
everything in this area and so probably in order  
to explore this whole Mall you would need like 
two full days and you'll still have only seen  
a small amount and I've only been able to eat at 
a fraction of the restaurants there's one thing  
that I have heard oh look at that right there we 
got a trolley going by I wonder if we can get on  
that thing I don't know where they pick up but 
I did read something here guys that there's like  
um on the back side of the mall facing the ocean 
there's like a really nice place to go for Sunset  
so maybe we'll stop by in an upcoming Vlog uh 
we shall see but I hope you guys enjoyed coming  
with us on this adventure and as always thanks 
so much for watching we'll see in the next one
