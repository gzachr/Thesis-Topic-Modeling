hey guys it's me again jen and welcome back to my 
channel today i'm gonna give you 11 great reasons  
why you should be working here in ireland and 
not someplace else but just like everything else  
it's not always rainbows and butterflies so i'm 
gonna make a two-part video where and i'm gonna  
make another one and tell you guys some of the 
things that i don't really fancy about ireland
so if you're new here i talk a lot about living 
overseas and sometimes i also share some of my  
travels if you don't want to miss any of that 
please don't forget to hit that subscribe button  
and also smash that notification bell if this is 
your second or third or fourth time being here  
then thank you very much for your support and i 
stan all of you guys first and i think the most  
important of them all is to work in life balance 
i am a certified public accountant i worked as an  
auditor in the Philippines for three years and as 
a general accountant in Malaysia for four years  
and from all of those experiences i can say that 
my work and my personal life are balanced the most  
here in Ireland here no one's gonna raise their 
eyebrows when you leave work on the dot i remember  
back in the days when i was so anxious leaving 
work on time because my boss and even some of my  
colleagues would think that my workload is too 
little so i get worried that maybe the next day  
or the next week i will get some more tasks it's 
like the longer you work the more hard working  
you are but actually that is the complete opposite 
you want to be an efficient employee so you won't  
spend all of your days and nights working in the 
office and also you won't need to wait for your  
bosses to leave before you can actually go home 
and i'm quite sure one way or another you can  
definitely relate to that i work from 9 to 5:30 
which is probably the same as everyone else who  
work in an office we have lunch breaks for an hour 
so technically we are only required to work for  
seven and a half hours but what's not written 
in that contract is that the company actually  
recommends employees to take breaks during the 
day to relieve stress and to just keep the body  
moving so in my office people will normally go 
for morning and afternoon breaks which is usually  
at 10:00 a.m and 4:00 p.m they would go to the 
pantry make their own tea or coffee chat away  
with other people about weather and football 
but you see the time isn't also set like it is  
very flexible that you can actually go whenever 
you want just as long as you are not neglecting  
any of your meetings or deliverables of course 
number two leave credits we get a whopping 25  
yes 25 annual leave credits compared to 
the minimum of 12 days in the Philippines  
and if i remember correctly 21 days in Malaysia 
and to make it way better all of those 25 days  
are available for use by the start of the year so 
you can actually use as many days as you want in  
whatever month that you like for example january, 
february, march unlike in some places where  
you earn the leave credits on a monthly basis 
which makes it impossible for you to take  
long holidays by the start of the year looking 
back on all the holidays that i did in 2019 i  
can't actually imagine having just the 12 
days of holidays in one year to be honest  
number three permanent residency so if you 
are holding a critical skills working permit  
you can apply for permanent residency within 
two years otherwise if you're holding a general  
working permit then you'll need just an extra 
year and that makes it three years before you  
can do the application which is not too bad at 
all especially that being a permanent resident  
has a lot of benefits and i think that deserves 
a different video but today i'm going to tell you  
the two things that i think make a whole lot 
of difference first you don't need a working  
visa anymore to work here in Ireland which 
is usually a deal breaker for most applicants  
because some companies don't have enough 
resources to undergo that long and expensive  
immigration process so there are actually 
more opportunities for permanent residents  
second you can go in and out of Ireland without 
any visa requirement let's say you want to go home  
for a long while let's say three to six months and 
that you'd want to resign from your job then you  
can do so and then fly back here to Ireland with 
no job yet as long as you have a valid permanent  
resident status number four citizenship you can 
apply for Irish citizenship after five years worth  
of days that you are physically here in Ireland 
but don't get me wrong i am a proud Filipino i  
love being a Filipino and i'm definitely gonna 
retain my Filipino citizenship when the time  
comes that i can apply for the Irish passport it's 
just that i believe that holding an Irish passport  
is gonna give me better benefits and also better 
opportunities and if you are a wonder lost like  
me on top of the list is being able to travel to 
other countries with no visa requirement number  
five easy accessibility to anywhere in the world 
my personal mantra is i work to live and for me  
one way of living is traveling to see new places, 
taste new food and experience different cultures  
and Ireland is a very strategic place of doing 
that because it has a massive range of airports  
that can bring you anywhere in the world with 
reasonably priced flights i usually go with  
Ryanair and they're actually really good as long 
as you read their fine print like the rules about  
the baggage and about your boarding pass and then 
you'll be able to fly with them smoothly without  
paying additional fees you'll even get better 
rates if you plan in advance i actually scored  
a 50 euro return flight to Amsterdam back in 2019. 
i live four hours away from Dublin where the main  
airport is but luckily for me we have a very small 
airport here in Kerry which is a 20 minute drive  
away from town from there i can go directly 
to the UK, to Spain, to Germany and Portugal  
and i am telling you it is the best airport ever 
like you can actually arrive there one hour before  
your flight and you're still gonna make it there 
was one time i actually pushed it to 30 minutes  
and guess what i still made it but i don't 
recommend that though because i was [ __ ] myself  
all the way to the airport and yeah it's just 
way too risky and you don't want that plane to  
live without you i think the cheapest flight that 
i got before the Covid was a 30 euro return flight  
to the UK number six every corner is instagram 
worthy if you are a nature lover like me you'll  
definitely love Ireland you will be surrounded 
by beautiful landscapes, a lot of greeneries for  
walking, cycling and just mind-blowing and 
stunning views in fact there are actually  
a lot of shows and movies that were shot here in 
Ireland like Game of Thrones in Belfast, Star Wars  
and Skellig, Leap Year in Dublin and so much more 
i actually made a video which is a very short tour  
of my little town here in Ireland and you will 
be surprised how gorgeous it is so you better  
check it out to see a glimpse of it i'm gonna put 
the link up there so you can check it after this  
number seven multicultural you can meet a lot of 
new people here in Ireland and experience their  
different cultures first hand see, Ireland houses 
a lot of international companies and it is normal  
for them to recruit different cultures because 
diversity actually helps them win in different  
markets in my office i am the only Filipino most 
of my colleagues are Irish but there are Russians,  
South Africans, Turkish and i became really 
good friends with a gorgeous Lithuanian lady  
and a great Hungarian couple we spent a lot 
of time together back then but unfortunately  
they left me here and went back to their home 
countries already even though we are miles apart  
we still talk to each other and travel together 
and that's the best part of it you don't lose the  
connection with the people that you become friends 
with you know who you are i miss you guys so much  
i am looking forward to seeing you again and 
traveling with you again number eight the people  
here in Ireland you feel like you're a family the 
stereotype that Irish people are very friendly  
and welcoming is actually very true back in 2018 i 
was still in the Philippines because we are still  
processing my working permit and then a typhoon 
hit the Philippines it was so strong that it made  
it to the international news and i was so amazed 
and so touched because i received emails from my  
bosses, future bosses at that time, and also the 
HR recruiter that was talking to me to check if my  
family and i are doing fine these people haven't 
met me in person but they actually remember that i  
am from the Philippines and took the time to send 
me that email just to check up on me that is just  
so amazing and from there i knew that i am in 
a great company with a lot of great people also  
Irish people love giving out compliments they 
will not hesitate to tell you that you've done  
a really great job at work and sometimes a 
stranger will tell you how gorgeous you are  
and not in a creepy manner like this morning 
hey good morning your coast is beautiful  
thanks so much number nine the pub culture Irish 
people love their pubs and it's not because they  
want to get wasted it's one of their favorite 
social activities and you'll be amazed how much  
culture is in there sometimes i actually feel that 
there are more pubs than people here you know each  
one of them are offering different things like 
live music, traditional Irish music, some of them  
have dance floors and you might want to sit for 
this, some of them have karaoke yes and Filipinos  
love karaoke so much so right away i became a 
regular of that pub just across my house and  
that's the best pub ever i actually had my 
28th birthday there that was so fun number  
10 the language i actually talked about this in 
my first ever video where i gave out some tips  
on how you can actually find and land a job here 
in Europe i'm gonna put the link up there just in  
case you want to check that out after the brexit 
it's now only Ireland that is the English-speaking  
country in the whole of the European Union so if 
you want to make it to Europe without learning the  
other languages definitely Ireland is the place to 
go now we're down to number 11. last but not least  
they love my skin color gone were the days when i 
was teased of my dark color it was crazy because  
it happened in school when i was working in 
the Philippines when i was working in Malaysia  
they understand that's part of the culture back 
home if you have a fair skin that's better you  
are more beautiful but here people actually pay to 
have this luscious brown color like in the shops  
instead of whitening lotions whitening soaps 
glutathione tablets what you're going to find  
are tanning lotions and tanning beds and instead 
of being teased i get complimented for my skin  
for anyone who has experienced the same i just 
want to tell you that it does get better so  
get your booties here now and you'll be 
the queens and kings so yeah that's it guys  
i hope that you're already thinking of moving 
here in Ireland and watch out for the next video  
where i'm gonna tell you guys some of the things 
that i don't fancy about Ireland and yeah so ciao
