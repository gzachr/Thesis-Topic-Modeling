soy sauce one with vinegar but always chili

expected her to be this song good morning  
coffee it's fruit it's highland plant local 
coffee thanks so much enjoy your breakfast guys

so that's like a dollar fifty or something yeah  
and the coffee brew is 28 pesos yeah yeah what's 
the name of the restaurant it's garlic it's very  
nice they know that i love spicy dan sort of 
spicy that's all we cook at home spicy and this  
tuxedo is not for see though this is longanisa and 
they make it by themselves so it's pork right yeah

it's more nicer than the heel taster
um very nice very flavor very different than 
what we eat in the expensive restaurant this  
much breakfast it's very nice coffee

it's different than the other i mean there's 
20 different kinds of coffees up here
and i haven't tasted this

so they make the sausage themselves yes and 
these are the garlic rice it's real garlic rice
very nice thank you for the spices yeah very 
thoughtful then to give you yeah without  
asking yeah that's because you're a famous travel 
vlogger aren't you no because every time i go to  
restaurant i have to ask the chili but this night 
they bring it for me and two kinds right now yeah  
look at this beautiful dessert they 
brought us from the garlic restaurant the  
thank you um thank you Ben and Ricky yeah we 
don't we don't um uh ask for any kind of uh  
discount or anything when we promote places we're 
not we just we feel it within our view if we were  
getting stuff for free but they know who we 
are when we pay for our meal but then they  
just brought this little gift uh anyway we'll 
try it out see how it is done eating okay why is
i don't think i've had it before whatever it is
what is that
i don't know but it's delicious
it's really nice i better test it though i 
don't want you to get sick eating something
trying to trying out the pastry
that's nice i don't know what the flavor 
is either but it's delicious they will ask
the local version of that one is a local pastry 
they call it ensaymada but for us chef ben  
made an innovation instead of the 
loneliness of mother he grilled it  
okay and then i started putting something 
on top of it mix it with something else  
and it became good and we make it at home 
and increase it here it's very nice thank you
garlic restaurant food dessert and coffee price 
and food are very good their food is made by love  
which is why it is so delicious 
i love everything in their menu  
longanisa bangus which is mere fish chocolate 
cake grill ensaymada which is sweet filipino  
bread this is very special the sweetness is just 
nice dana and i miss the chocolate cake so much
cosmic kitchen we ate here the other day during 
the sunday um but it was good so we're back  
i'm gonna get the brown rice here uh with this 
baked meat and the beans back there with tofu so  
we're liking a little food court and each of our 
meals each of our lunches is a dollar sixty we've  
got two vegan dishes here with a brown rice and 
a soup and Qiang has squid chicken and white rice
look at that big screen tv over there it's a 
beautiful part of town it's called sessions road
there's a lot of vegetarian choices in baguio and 
so it's a great it's not unusual though because  
it's a university town it's like a creative 
town you have artists and musicians here  
and so it's the kind of crowd that don't 
want to eat vegetarian some of them
tofu skin does it remind me of the real thing
cosmic kitchen their barbecue is really impressive 
it tastes and chew like eating a real barbecue  
pork but don't worry it is not a real pot it's 
a vegetarian and made with soy good price too
i want to have this one and this one
found this heaven on earth restaurant it's a  
it's a vegetarian restaurant and it's 
this meal is a dollar eighties includes  
um the brown rice two uh kinds of shanghai yeah 
three kinds of ones vegetarian meat and vegetables  
plus a soup and got three different kinds of so 
you could try them on yeah it's all vegetarian
dollar each i'm loving it let's try it though when 
i was growing up my mother used to make meatloaf  
she would take hamburger and add a bunch of stuff 
too like bread and i'm not sure what else onions  
this reminds me of meatloaf it's vegetarian 
of course but that's the first time i've  
ever had meatloaf since i became a 
vegetarian i don't know 40 years ago
yeah 40 years
percent meal we come here 1.40 yeah 
with a soup or soup and one other thing
here's another soup today it's 
like have a ginger tastes very good
heaven on earth vegetarian center is our 
favorite restaurant in baguio city then  
we pick out the lunch and dinner from 
the restaurant after his run every day  
we have at least 30 meal in this restaurant
you're your own chef with a hot pot they 
just supply the stove and the mature  
the sous chef you're the chef 
yeah very these are nice favorites
oh so good just put ginger 
they cook with ginger and milk
because i'm the one who eats meat 
so so all the bees belong to me
three seconds
dreams about this food all year long and she 
doesn't get to eat it off because i'm vegetarian  
and the soup gets meat in it so i don't want 
to eat it but now we build something separate  
good oh but the vinegar is so good so fast 
now i have this in my in my sauce i have  
garlic chili vinegar and cilantro and some yeah
it's very nice
i put the chili sauce garlic what else 
peanut no peanuts over here separate onion  
like spring onions and cilantro inside my soup 
so the whole thing has that flavor it's very nice  
and it's spicy but not not too spicy i might have 
to add some more yeah so good i like being awesome
very nice i mean it's a very 
nice it's 399pesos per person  
and i think it's very nice that you spend 
time eating you know with your friends  
that's how we eat also yeah it's like 
a celebration yeah it's not just a meal  
there's all this food around you you feel like 
you're the king of the world plus there's not  
much people around here so we can enjoy 
the normal time yeah we just we just need  
some slaves with like fans waving us to keep us 
cool but it's not hot so that doesn't make nice
the rumors are true we are in rumors
rumors my favorite dive bar with delicious 
filipino dish i have pork chop meal and it  
was really good the vegetarians is cooked 
with the butter beside that beer is cheap  
we would come here in the evening for a couple of 
drinks with food to relax at the end of the day
