activities here on the street oh local drinks
yeah let me try
some pineapple juice
oh that looks good I'm already thirsty [Music]
it's okay you can keep the change all right
okay this is really a wow food from the Philippines
pogi is chilling there in a month I know these
crackers are often used in the Philippines
in desserts and so I decided to bring these
back from the Philippines to the Netherlands
I'm gonna get the other ingredients from the
grocery store look who's here [Music] Fergie
hello
pogi why is this a wild dessert or wow street
food from the Philippines when I tasted this
one you know I like to try street food from
the Philippines when I tasted this particular
dessert I was really like wow this is amazing
the mango taste is really good it's an ice
cream with mango flavor but they also add
the real mangga It's a combination of mango
ice cream real mango and then they add the
graham crackers crushed condensada and also
some mango syrup a combination of the textures
you know it's like sweet milky creamy because
of the carne asada crunchy because of the
graham crackers so when I tried it it was
like wow no good just kidding oh no look at
this ah these birds they almost attack me
because they have babies see wow they're cute
in the month it's almost Springtime here in
the Netherlands
we need condensada and also mango ice cream
if they have I really hope we can find it
so that we can really recreate this um street
food from the Philippines wow they have lots
of choice where's the manga
[Music]
I almost thought it was a Halo Halo it's just
a brand name I guess
[Music]
found the mangga ice it actually says sorbettes
sorbet ice we call it but I guess I can also
use this one and it's not too much Malaki
so we can restrict the the calories a little
bit oh I cannot believe I found mango syrup
amazing I was not sure if I could find it
but we have it here in the Netherlands foreign
cups I think it's gonna look very nice in
here
[Music]
[Music] [Applause]
[Music]
foreign
mango syrup is a little bit thin I'm gonna
thicken it a little bit with cornstarch I
guess that will make it a little bit better
because then it will stick around the edges
of the bowl it's very simple you know it you
can combine just a few ingredients into one
bowl and it becomes like a really nice dessert
but if I talk about Filipino street food I
really like to go on the streets in the Philippines
you know explore the food there's so many
variety what I really like is that you can
buy dessert but you can also buy kakanin some
snacks some barbecue nice drinks there's a
lot of nice food that you can try I recently
made a trip in the Philippines where I went
to this street food market in Pangasinan in
Luzon and it was so amazing there was a really
nice experience I did actually I did do a
challenge for 1 000 pesos to see how much
street food I could buy with 1000 Pesos but
in the end it was a little bit too much because
1000 Pesos is quite a lot in the Philippines
on the street so the most things are like
10 pesos 20 pesos maybe 50 pesos something
like that so but if you have not watched that
video yet I'll put the link for you in the
description it is mango syrup it smells so
good Bango guys so I'm adding the cornstarch
let's use something else for that
[Music] I also added a little bit of flour
and you can see it's really nice and thick
now but the color is a little bit less yellow
I also like to know from you what is your
favorite Filipino street food or Filipino
dessert I've never tried making a mango float
so I think this is pretty similar to mango
float it's this common in the Philippines
let me know okay I have a beautiful fresh
manga it's unfortunately not the yellow mangoes
as from the Philippines because those are
super matamis diba but this one is also very
nice I like the taste it's good and they're
nice they're they're ripe but not overly ripe
I'm gonna just uh use these two pieces here
and cut them in tiny cubes I guess it will
be so nice combined with the mango sorbet
I just tasted the syrup and I I almost want
to say it's abnormally good I know it cannot
be like that but it's so nice foreign [Music]
it became really nice and thick let's add
the condensada it's time for some graham crackers
mango sorbet oh it's pretty soft wow look
at that that looks pretty good
condensada on top [Music] let's add a little
bit more mango and then also the real fresh
manga we're gonna add it and finally a little
bit more of the Graham on the side wow Naman
oh I think it looks pretty good Before We
tikman natin I want to share with you the
the video at the end of this video okay where
I'm going in the Philippines to a street food
market and I'm trying the challenge with the
1000 Pesos so don't forget to do that let's
take a little bit of everything [Music]
wow oh it's really good it really reminds
me of sa pinas foreign
