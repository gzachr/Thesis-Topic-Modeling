Hello, I'm Ricky
It's Thursday here today.
Around lunch time..
I'm on my way to pick up Erica.
And then, we will be heading to a Pinoy restaurant near her work.
Because, she has been craving, craving for Pinoy food lately..
of course.. she is pregnant.
Last night, she wanted to eat sinigang but we didn't have any ingredients at home to
make one so. So I promised her that I'll
be bringing her to the restaurant
tomorrow lunch. It's been a long time
that we haven't had Pinoy food.
I guess I have to learn since she's
pregnant, she will probably make me cook
a lot. You know, push me to make Pinoy
food for her. And couple days ago she's
been craving for green mango. I mean
where in Korea can we get green mango.
She told me she wants to eat this green
mango with Bagoong sauce.
It's like shrimp, shrimp sauce. That is an
upcoming mission for me.
She hasn't started her maternity leave yet but I think she'll be on her leave in a couple of months.
People starting to go out and.. of course so are we...becoming jammed again. I wonder
how's the traffic in Manila. Okay,
we're almost here. Actually right here is
very close to Myeongdong area. Eulji-ro, to be specific.
Oh okay, I see her.
Thanks for coming babe.
Did you wait long?
Nope.
We have like an hour break.
I think it's enough. Just eat and then...
go back to work.
So it's going to be like a quick lunch date!
Erica, we are taking a video now.
Oh yeah?
Can you say "Hi"
Hello...hahaha

Especially, your advice regarding pregnancy. It's really fun reading them.

We truly appreciate your advice, as I am also far away from my family.

And go through the pregnancy..

Can I ask for more of this?
E: I guess so.

I think I was the one who was
craving for Filipino food...
Hahaha..
I think I finished everything.
E: Why were you so fast?
E: And I'm almost getting mad, like wait, why is he finishing it.
E: I haven't tried the pusit yet.
R: Do you want the last pusit?
E: I'm going to have the smaller one.
E: That is so cute.
It felt like we were in the Philippines.
Yeah..It tasted like authentic Filipino food.
How was the Adobong pusit, since it's your first time trying that one.
Hmmmm...Adobong pusit was...
It's like, you are eating the whole squid including the inside part.
But, I like that actually.
It gives you a rich flavor taste I guess.
In Seoul, there are not much places to eat Filipino food.
There was also one in Itaewon before, Cusina. Do you remember?
R: Oh yeah, name was something like Cusina.
There are not much Filipino restaurants in Seoul.
So if you want to eat, you mostly need to cook by yourself.
You know Rick, I'm actually craving for Philippine barbecue.
Do you remember? It's on a stick.
They usually sell it on the street and
it's grilled...
R: On charcoal?
E: Yeah, yeah on charcoal.
I think I saw it in a Barangay..
Like the whole Barangay smells like this barbecue.
Yeah.. it smells nice.
and the sauce is sweet.
I think I've tried it once in the Philippines.
Oh yeah? Only once?
I think once or twice.
Can we make that on the weekend?
Okay,
But do you know how to make?
I can ask my mom.
Okay if you can get the ingredients. Why not?
I'm so excited!!!
We are almost close to the office.
Back to work..
That was a good lunch date.
Very quick...
A quick one..
A few days ago, Erica told me
that she wants to have Pinoy barbecue.
And I looked it up what is Pinoy barbecue.
It seems like you would be needing a charcoal grill.
So I ordered one from the internet..and..
