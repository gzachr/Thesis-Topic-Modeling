[Music] [Applause]
hello welcome back to another reaction review 
video with me Nina schofield singer songwriter  
vocal coach and session musician and I'm here 
to watch a much requested video so this is reene  
Velasquez and she is singing at the MX Music 
Awards I don't know if we pronounced that the  
mix music awards that would be cool uh and this 
is is s maet muli hopefully I have pronounced  
that right now I did a little bit of research and 
this came from a Filipino romantic drama uh the  
translation of which is hope it happens again so 
that gives me a little bit of um an understanding  
of the lyrics just to start out with but we're 
going to watch and kind of focus on the music and  
what Regina is doing here vocally and just enjoy 
some incredible singing here we go here here we go
[Applause] okay
oh [Music]
that
[Applause] that audience so supportive uh yeah 
we just had a little bit of piano in there and  
then it went back to the Acappella but I'm 
really enjoying that because you get this  
Dynamic control from regene and she's just in 
the perfect spot it sounds so pure so [Music]
beautiful and
strength [Music] I
[Music] [Applause]
think whoa uh so the D5 let's just 
hear that note again it went on way  
longer than I thought it was going to as 
well incredible breath control [Music]
there like that [Music]
base the lovely Legato string line on top just
stunning
[Music]
this is the a great example of an almost 
conversational vocal that's so well  
controlled in the uh dynamically quieter part 
of her vocal that it's almost breaking up you  
know great vocals aren't about perfection in 
necessarily holding a note so that it doesn't  
break up sometimes the Perfection comes from the 
emotion and that means that a word will break up  
a little bit especially in a Qui a dynamic part 
this is so so good to be studied bookmark this
[Music] oh the hell
no
[Music] the cry
[Music]
onset uh yeah back to that D5 again 
absolutely [Music] stunning [Music]  
the quality of [Music] the uh 
let's do that again that [Music]
up so the G5 and not only that the 
mic technique you see she pulled away  
because she didn't want the pickup 
to peek so it didn't make a clipping  
sound or anything no Distortion 
just a woo right up there [Music]
[Music]
okay whoa let me hear that again [Music] 
there's that determined sort of cry in
there okay [Music] okay range H that note the
Domino and the break up of the note as [Music]
[Applause] [Music] [Applause]
[Music]
well [Applause] that was 
stunning last phrase [Music]
wow
gorgeous uh yeah so so pretty that was definitely 
one of the the best emotional captures that I've  
seen from reene I think now when was this 
from does it say I don't know when this was  
from I'm going to find out because this is 
definitely a step back in time I think for  
me and I like to kind of know you know the year 
that I'm watching so that when I watch another  
performance from later on I can kind of compare 
in a way in my head 1994 Perhaps Perhaps let me  
know if I got that right and it looks like that 
song won the award for best performance by a  
female recording artist ha great success so uh I 
really enjoyed that and evidently so did everyone  
else I can see why it won awards because it's 
just got that something that connects with you  
emotionally especially if you've got someone 
like regine who can connect with you through  
a screen never mind in in a a live situation 
like this um but her specialty connecting just  
through the audio so that you can listen 
to the song and your headphones or see it  
in a movie or whatever it is and feel every 
every emotion that she is portraying lovely
