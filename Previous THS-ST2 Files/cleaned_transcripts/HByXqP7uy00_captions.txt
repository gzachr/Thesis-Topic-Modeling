hey everybody this is matt coming to you up close 
and personal with another reaction this is a  
first-time reaction to i've heard marcelito pamoy 
before but this is the first time i'm reacting to  
the beauty and the beast i know the song we all 
know it this is from america's got talent in 2020.  
this guy knocks me out i never heard of him before 
until like a few days ago and i was like what  
so he's great and uh and by the way you know 
love and spaghetti i always uh give a little  
love a little love quote i'm going to tell 
you my own personal experience real quick  
love can make you feel like you're a kid again 
i mean it can make you feel just like you're  
young again so definitely search for that if you 
don't have it if you have it you know what i mean  
uh and that's a great feeling because then 
you can go on a time machine and go back and  
feel like you're young again like two little 
kids running through a field laughing and  
frolicking like a couple of you know innocent 
little children in love isn't that beautiful
anyway if you like my reactions please 
subscribe like comment and share  
and also be sure to um let me know if you have 
a song you want me to react to i'll do it but  
anyway let's get right to it shall we anyway

let's go have a beer or a cup of coffee and talk

is super super talented i'm so glad  
that i discovered him just recently i mean 
can you imagine all those beautiful artists  
and musicians and singers out there that we 
still haven't discovered yet i'm going to keep  
going with this because i'm discovering them like

i hope that you're enjoying this as much as i am  
if you are please subscribe to the channel because 
then you'll you know get more of this stuff  
and other people will be also made aware of it 
and listen um you know i if you by the way the  
reason why you're also even watching me right now 
is because i i i took a course online that teaches  
you how to earn income online i'm not i mean this 
is a shameless promotion right now but i'm only  
telling you for a couple of reasons but the main 
reason is because if you're thinking about doing  
any kind of business online click on the link 
below check it out and go go get go do what you  
want to do have fun online you could make you can 
make money on with these videos i'm not making  
you know anything i'm i i i am eventually probably 
going to do something with this but it's secondary  
for me but if you have some great ideas of what 
you have a product or a service that you want to  
you know get online and sell take this course 
and and knock it out of the park or just do what  
i'm doing and do reaction videos but that's 
what brought me here so anyway listen hey  
it's nice to be important but it's more 
important to be nice loving spaghetti  
and hey listen take it easy and if it's real 
easy take it twice thanks a lot guys bye bye
