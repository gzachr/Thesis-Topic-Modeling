so- i'm trying the headphone thing
for japanese releases, so hopefully it can
take up with the audio.
maybe i will edit the video of the- thing
and see uh- if it'll- work uh-
because japanese releases are like an
instant copyright, and that's a no-no
right now we are checking out
EXO-CBX 'Ka-CHING!'
we're gonna have a good time i feel like
let's begin~

i feel- i see him i see him
man~ i wish it was a little bit longer man
i really do wish it was a little bit
longer, like you know the average- ah, um-
the average m/v is like 3 minutes and
20 seconds kinda, i feel like
definietly, it's already in my head
like it's playing 'ka-ching ka-ching' in
my head right now, like ka-ching ka-ching
i dunno how they filmed that like
it's probably like a big green screen
area, i'm guessing, i don't know
but uh- do they have a making of m/v?
that would be awesome to watch actually
um- but it was really well done
i feel like. cbx be killing it
the choreo (!!) you think i should do
this more for like you know, just use the
headphones just for japanese releases
because if it doesn't work out um- yeah
i think, i think i will actually
actually think it will work out
so- i'll think of this in the future for
uhm- for next time
