if you saw the first vlog of 2022 you 
noticed that i started to learn more tagalog  
i already finished chapter one of the book 
and now i'm ready to go for chapter two so  
this vlog is gonna be exciting guys because i 
will make a pandesal dough but first um let's  
make some dutch food okay i'm gonna show you one 
dutch meal so dutch food is really simple okay  
and what is so nice about dutch food uh 
we call it you know and i have a back here  
this is uh onions and carrots okay just onions and 
carrots okay uh and we call this hot spot fruit  
means vegetables okay and then here is a pork 
meat and potatoes and we're gonna basically use  
these ingredients a little bit of butter and 
that's about it some salt and then after that  
i'm gonna make a panda salt dough it's 
going to be exciting because i want to  
bring it to my parents you know a real filipino 
breakfast i want to make cinnamon from the sauce
and i'm thinking to actually bring them some 
sausages like a longanisa okay so for the dutch  
food first i'm gonna peel these potatoes i'm 
using this uh potato peeler see it's very easy  
just like this to get the peel off and i think you 
call these patatas right in tagalog patatas but i  
noticed that in the philippines it's very hard 
to get potatoes and if you can get the potatoes  
they're quite expensive actually so i'm wondering 
if you can get uh potatoes easily in your region  
in the philippines so then once uh the peel 
is off i just cut it in a few pieces like that
so now i wash the potatoes a little bit add some 
water and we're gonna add salt quite a bit of salt
and then let's turn the heat on okay 
now this is pork shoulder it's about  
700 grams of pork shoulder okay so i'm 
gonna fry that in a little bit of butter
just like that i think that's quite maraming  
i put a little bit too much butter but it 
gives more flavor diba now the nice thing  
about this food is so simple like i said 
you just what you do you put all the onions
the hot let me open that back a little 
bit more guys ah that's better no
so see how easy this is you just put everything 
the hot and then you cover okay we fry the  
pork shoulder in the butter now i can only fit 
three at a time so i'm gonna put three first and  
then the other two okay i'm very excited for the 
new vlogs because uh this is gonna be a continuous  
vlog okay so 2022 it will be continuous series 
on pinoy planet like i said i'm preparing for  
panda salt though after this we're gonna make 
panda salt dough we're gonna make a nice filipino  
breakfast for my parents so last video before 
this one it was the 10 best moments of the  
food that i brought to my parents based on 
your recommendations on your um on the moments  
that you like the most i got the feedback 
from you so i put all together in one video  
if you have not seen that one yet you can uh 
please go ahead to watch it um so the next one  
is gonna be filipino breakfast so it is time 
to flip them over the pork meat let's go see
not yet let me let me put it back because it's 
still not let's wait a little while longer  
so flip them around and you see now 
they're becoming nice and brown okay  
and the onion carrots and potatoes are boiling
i wish that i could
okay so the pork meat is done look 
at that guys so of course i've put a  
little bit of salt on both sides uh so 
these are very tasty for sure and now
we can have a look at the carrots and potatoes 
and a little bit more thyme and also i'm going  
to remove some water so now i removed all 
the excess water there's still a little  
bit of water there that's okay and then we're 
going to use this thing to mesh everything okay
smash it
okay so now it's time to add some butter okay 
always nice i think about two tablespoons or so  
that is very tasty so and basically that's it so 
i just mixed everything the butter the potatoes  
the carrots the onions a little bit of salt you 
can also add a little bit of pepper if you like  
and then you just put it on a plate with 
the meat that's it so now it's time to  
play a little bit of basketball i'm gonna play 
basketball i like to play basketball so the sun  
is out let's do a little game and then when 
we come back i will try a few moments later
so it's evening i finished the workout i just 
had a workout and now i want to prepare for  
lunga nissa okay so just a second i 
actually bought these sausages today  
these are japanese sausages but i couldn't find 
the longanisa in the store i think they don't sell  
it any longer so therefore i'm gonna try making my 
own longanisa because it needs to be filipino diba
now i will add a little bit 
of salt okay some athene  
not so much because i also want to add a 
little bit of soy sauce filipino soy sauce
sugar
let's add a few then i have sweet paprika 
powder okay let's add quite a bit of  
sweet paprika powder gives it a nice um yeah a 
little bit of sweet smoky flavor kind of thing
set up maraming diba that is quite a lot so 
then i'm not sure if you normally do it but  
i'll be adding a little bit of filipino 
vinegar cane vinegar so just uh maybe two  
two or three so it's time to mix everything 
and then i'll put it in the ref for uh like  
two hours you know i changed my mind um there's 
no black pepper so i'm gonna add a little bit of  
hot sauce okay just a tiny bit quintillon and 
then in the freezer overnight okay we'll put um  
put this on the way scale let's do like uh 35 40 
grams so then i'm just rolling this in plastic
i think the shape already 
looks like uh longanisano
luco it became many longanisa and 
actually they're all 37 grams but  
this one is only 33. uh let's put 
them all in the freezer overnight
okay
it is um six o'clock in the morning 
you can hear my voice it's still early  
we're gonna make uh undersalt though but first 
first we're gonna take out the longanisa here they  
are there is pogi pogi wake me up at three o'clock 
at night you talaga so here's the ball for the  
longanisa okay and here's the ball for the panda 
salto i put them in a little bit of water see  
i'm adding approximately 250 ml of milk first 
about 55 grams of softened butter i sang it look
one package seven grams of instant yeast
and we'll mix this a little bit 400 grams of flour
50 grams of sugar
and finally 5 grams
and let's mix lahat one more time now the question 
is can we go to the philippines this year 2022 so  
it seems like the philippines has opened for 
uh tourists which sounds really good so um  
maybe i don't know yet but maybe there will be 
a chance us to go to the philippines this year  
that would be amazing of course so the dough is 
needed uh for now it's enough so we're gonna leave  
this for one hour covered okay now i will cut the 
longanessa or just cut the plastic open like this
it's already easier to take it out see
there we go that's our first longanisa so it 
has been quite some years for us to visit the  
philippines so um hopefully this year it will 
happen and then i can finally cook in peanuts
that is my wish so all the longanisa all the 
longanisa is in now let's wait for a while and  
then after the water has been gone i'm gonna 
put a little bit of mantika on one more talaga  
i am so curious to my parents filipino food 
reaction what do you think do they look okay  
they really smell very nice and they look pretty 
good i think they must be very much set up
