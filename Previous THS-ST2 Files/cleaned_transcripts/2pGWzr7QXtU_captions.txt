[Julia] -We're in Chinatown.
The oldest Chinatown in the world.
[JP] - Besides, China, right?
- I guess China might be the first.
(laughter)
(upbeat music plays)
[Jian] - Welcome guys.
We are literally now in
the heart of Chinatown
here in Manila, Philippines.
So here we are, this is the
historic Binondo Church.
[Julia] -Wow, this is a lot bigger
than it looks on the outside.
(upbeat music)
- This is Carvajal Street.
This is the last vestige of the wet market
that used to be all around this area.
As you can see there'll
be fruits everywhere.
(upbeat music)
Here we're going to have lumpia.
Lumpia is the Filipino term for anything
that resembles a spring roll.
It can be deep-fried or it
can be what we call fresh.
Since it's not deep-fried
we kind of equate it to fresh lumpia.
So that's what we're having today.
- So this lumpia is going to be healthy?
(beep)
- So this rice paper
wrapper, what she put was
ground peanuts, that's the brown stuff.
The white stuff is like
thin noodles that have been deep-fried.
And then the black stuff is seaweed.
That is a mixture of grated
carrots, cabbage, tofu and pork.
[Julia] -So they make them
fresh to order each time?
[Jian] -Yes, each time.
- Thank you very much.
- Careful on your head.
- Well, I don't have to be careful
but maybe JP, you should
be careful of your head.
[Jian] -So here we are.
It basically looks like
a burrito (laughs).
- It's nice and hot.
I like this.
I love how the peanuts
are crushed up in there.
It gives a really solid
texture and I love peanuts.
[Jian] - And then to finish it off,
just to have a different flavor,
this is the mystery sauce.
So, basically it's brown sugar, soy sauce,
a bit of corn starch to
make it nice and sticky.
- Yum
JP says it's really delicious.
He says it's good.
I can tell JP.
You weren't expecting to
like it this much, were you?
C'mon JP we've got to go.
(head thunks on wall)
[Jian] - This is the
typical Filipino turo turo.
Basically, it's kind of
like cafeteria style.
Basically you go up,
and "turo" in Filipino
actually means "to point".
So basically, you just
point at what you want,
and then sit down and eat.
It's one of the cheapest
forms of eating options
here in the Philippines.
- You know me.
I love a deal.
[Jian] - This is called biko.
Basically, that's nice sticky rice,
a ton of sugar, coconut milk.
[Julia] - Wow!
I'm going to give it a try.
It's very coconut forward,
but the sugar is caramelized.
I think that's where you
get this brown color.
It's fabulous.
It's so delicious, so tasty.
Could be addicting.
- I like the coconut crumble on top.
Mmmmm
Yeah.
I dig.
- Okay, it's got JP's stamp of approval.
Let's keep it moving.
It's a little sticky.
[Jian] - Here we're having
what's called kuchay-ah.
The best way to describe
it to Western viewers
is it's kind of, it's
reminiscent of an empanada.
[Julia] - I guess this
is one of those things
you should break it apart and show it.
What's inside?
[Jian] - So you have tofu
cubes, you have carrots.
You have pork as well.
And the green stuff is leeks.
- Yum!
I love it.
- Cheers!
[JP] - Ooh, kuchay kuchay.
[Julia] - JP likey.
- Me likey!
I like this!
It's very good!
(laughter)
It's like a Chinese Hot Pocket.
- (sings) Yum yum yum yum yum yum yum!
We're going for dumplings!
These aren't steamed dumplings.
They're going to be boiled.
It's just another day, another dumpling.
[Julia] - Oh!
Did you catch it?
[JP] - I caught it.
[Jian] - Did it get wet?
- No, don't worry about it being wet.
I got my foot wet though (laughs).
Well, that's what we're
doing in Chinatown.
We're getting our feet wet (laughs).
(upbeat music)
[Jian] - You're going to
want to get a shot of this.
That's corn hair. Corn silk.
[Julia] - Oh yeah.
[Jian] - They boil that here as a tea.
Supposedly it's good for arthritis
and all those aches and pains.
[Julia] - Oh, I always just
throw that stuff in the garbage
when I cook corn.
(beep)
[Jian] - This is the
main iconic street here
in Chinatown, in Binondo.
This is called Ongpin.
This is the one that
really looks a lot like
what you would expect a Chinatown.
There's an arch over there.
There's the lanterns
over here and all that.
- All right guys, come on.
Let's go.
We want to make it feel
like you guys are with us
so you're going to be coming with us.
We will put a link
to Jian's Airbnb experience
in the description
so you guys can join
on the same exact tour.
- If you want some food, I'm
the guy to hit up (laughs).
- So, literally a hole in the wall.
When I was looking for
this for the first time
I was like, "It's supposed to be here."
I couldn't find it.
It's one of the most humble
establishments I've ever seen.
But really really good fresh dumplings.
- Here we are.
At the best rated Chinese food restaurant
right here in Chinatown
Manila, Philippines.
And the only thing that
they sell here is dumplings.
Is that a fact?
[Jian] - No, they sell other stuff.
But the thing they sell
the most is dumplings.
(laughter)
- So this is ground pork
and kuchay which is leeks.
And then this one is just ground pork.
(upbeat music)
[Julia] - Look how they have the dough
pressed out into the
perfect amount of dough.
Then, they just take their
little, tiny cute rolling pins
and roll them thin.
I guess they make over a
thousand of these dumplings
every single day.
And they sell about half of those.
And the other half of
those are frozen, bagged up
and people are buying them
and cooking them at home.
Dumplings for breakfast!
That's a common thing?
[Jian] - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
This is a light soy sauce.
[Julia] - This is a garlic oil?
[Jian] - Chili garlic oil.
- Yum. Yum. Yum.
Literally I said that a hundred
times at the last restaurant
but this is becoming even more yum.
Yo!
Yum.
JP, you've got to taste.
- Whoo!
That's good!
I love that chili.
It woke me up.
[Julia] - JP's woke.
Is that from the chili, JP?
Or is it because we're in the Philippines?
Cheers!
(dumpling splats on table)
- Oh!
We could stay here for a while
but there's more food to taste.
(traditional Chinese music)
- So it's community prayer corner.
You can just come offer your prayers.
So start with the incense.
Usually it comes in threes just for luck.
Quick prayer for luck and safety.
- I pray for no rain and good luck.
And that all of our food digests quickly.
And then we can just eat more dumplings
after we have pork buns.
- So this is Wai Ying.
They are really known for
their very affordable food in general.
You guys were pretty brave
in eating weird stuff,
so we're doing chicken feet
again if you're up for that.
[JP] - So we started
buy getting our feet wet
and now we're going to eat the feet.
(laughter)
(traditional Chinese music)
[Julia] - So what is this?
Is this the chicken feet?
- Chicken feet.
And this one is called haukau here,
it's basically shrimp dumplings.
- All right. So where should we start?
[Jian] - Start with the
shrimp so it doesn't get cold.
[Julia] - Oh, I'm not going
to talk for like 30 seconds.
I'm just going to let it sit in my mouth.
(romantic music)
Yo!
That is incredible!
This is the best dumpling I've had yet.
Actually I shouldn't say that
because the other place
was really freaking good.
[Jian] - All right, so let's
go with the chicken foot.
So, with chicken feet there's
basically nothing to eat.
What you're eating is just the skin
and what little fat is attached to it.
The black stuff that you're moving
kind of reminds me of cockroach egg.
This is what cockroach eggs look like.
[Julia] - Oh.
- But this is not cockroach
egg. This is black beans.
- Oh, it's a bean, okay.
Oh my god.
[Jian] - So, you put it in your mouth
and you just suck on it.
- Is there bone inside?
- There is. And cartilage as well.
My personal mantra is
"if you can chew it, you can swallow it."
Down the hatch.
Just try to get the jelly
stuff that's attached to it.
Which is basically the skin.
(Julia giggles)
- I'm just so happy that this
tastes like Chinese food.
(traditional Chinese music)
It's like a Chinese barbeque almost.
- Yeah, very very very very Chinese-y.
- I think that the sauce
makes it incredibly delicious
and I'm almost forgetting
that it's a chicken foot
while I'm eating it
because the flavor's so good.
I didn't forget.
But I almost forgot.
Well, JP, I have an idea.
Why don't you try to
eat it with your foot.
[Jian] - He knows how to use his thumb.
[Julia] - (laughs) Okay, Jian.
JP's little foot is a rock star.
JP, don't pick your nose.
- So, milk
Whoa!
- So, whoa!
I kicked it!
We're good.
A little drama in the video, guys.
We had an earthquake.
[Jian] - Next we have our bean curd roll.
Think of it like a sausage.
This wrapper right here,
that's basically from tofu.
And then when chop it open,
there you go.
You have nice ground pork,
there's shrimp there.
- I'm confused why it's called bean.
[Jian] - Because this is.
- Because tofu is a bean.
[Jian] - Yeah.
Yum. Yum.
Yum.
- Mmmmm.
I can't even say enough yums.
- So, if you think chicken feet
was the weirdest thing
we're going to have today,
oooooh no no no no.
- I just can't believe there's more to do!
- So next, we're going to find
some nice fluffy steamed buns.
- I love buns in my mouth.
(chill electronic music)
- So this place
is a good 70, 80 years
that it's been here,
and they are actually
known for their noodles.
But that's for another day.
We're here for their really
really good fluffy white buns.
Pork buns basically.
So, we'll have a version
which is a meatball
later on in the day.
But here this is asado.
It comes with this lovely,
lovely mystery sauce
basically it's more soy sauce. More sugar.
And then this one is a special one.
Because it has a salted egg in the center.
And when eating buns
here in the Philippines,
always check the bottom
because not all places
will have printed paper
it could be just plain white paper
and you could end up eating it
so always check the bottom
and peel off the paper.
[Julia] - Where's that egg?
I'm searching for egg.
[Jian] - That is a salted egg.
I just want you guys to try it
because you never had just
plain salted egg before, right?
[Julia] - No.
- Basically what you do
it you get a duck egg
and you dunk it in mud with a ton of salt.
- Mud?
- Mud. Yep.
- Very salty, I like it.
It reminds me of like a Passover seder
when I take my parsley and
I dip it in salt water.
It gives me a Passover vibe.
[JP] - All right, then pass it over.
(laughter)
- Here you go!
I'm not a dad yet, but I
got dad jokes (laughs).
[Julia] - Did you say bad jokes?
(laughter)
- Mmm, I love salt.
You know it really does
bring out the flavor in food.
(laughter)
Oh yeah, yeah. Ohh! Mmhmm.
Oh, look at that!
- I've never had a bun that's so fluffy.
- Mmhmm, oh yeah.
[Julia] - You keep going "okay"
and I think it's a lot better than okay.
- No!
(Julia laughs)
Very very very good. Very fluffy.
- I can't believe we're going to eat more.
We're still going.
So are you saying
that just a side of
asado wouldn't be enough?
A side of asado?
Nevermind.
I gotta go.
Okay, I'm coming back.
Why didn't you guys follow me?
Oh yeah, we have to pay.
[Jian] - Is there something
I will make you try
that you will hate me for?
[Julia} - No.
[Jian] - No?
(Jian laughs)
- You are the devil.
(Jian laughs menacingly)
I have an idea of what it's going to be.
Are you feeding us testicles?
- I am neither confirming nor
denying any of your guesses.
(laughter)
- That is just not the same laugh
I've been hearing you
laugh this entire time.
It's not like, urine?
- No, no, no, no, no.
We're not Bear Grylls over here.
[JP] - A hundred thousand
dollars, I'd eat poop.
(Julia laughs)
(traditional Chinese music)
[Jian] - So, this is a nice
Chinese-style bakery here.
There's just this little
thing I'd like you to try.
So this is tikoy.
Basically, it's sticky rice.
And then the center is mung beans.
Closest I would describe this is
it feels in the mouth like mochi.
(traditional Chinese music)
- Mmmmm
- So this is more like kind
of a Chinese deli/bakeshop.
What they're really really famous for is
generally you get steamed
buns and you steam it, right?
But theirs is fried first.
So, they have this huge
metal steaming area.
And then it sears the bottom
and they cover it, and then it puffs up.
So the rest is puffy,
but the bottom has a little bit of char.
- It's so so hot.
I'm probably going to
burn my mouth right now,
but I need to try it now.
[Jian] - So, this is the
second type of siopao
here in the Philippines.
Which is bola bola.
Which is generally just
a meatball in the center.
- I like this one.
Mmmm
It's so good.
JP, I'm going to share
this one with you, okay?
That way I can save
room for a secret thing
that I don't know.
It's balls, isn't it?
You like it!
This is pork bun.
Going down in the books.
Going down in your digestive
system to your buns (giggles).
(slow electronic music)
- So, always start with
the free stuff (laughs).
So this is hopia,
the iconic sweet snack that
you have from Chinatown.
Now, these ones that
they're making us taste
is a new version, it's custard.
So let's try the new stuff
before we go to the OG ones.
[Julia] - I want ube.
JP, you go for coconut.
Cheers.
Mmmm.
It's like chilled.
I was surprised it was going to be cold.
The more and more I eat ube,
the more I become a little
bit obsessed with the flavor.
It's really creamy and delicious.
Yes, custard inside.
[Jian] - So this is the OG one.
This is hopia munggo.
It's mung bean.
It's nice.
I did start with trying the ube one
and I think that is just
really freaking fabulous
so I'm into that a little
bit more than this.
JP likes it!
We got another thumbs up.
[Jian] - And this one is purple yam.
- I like it.
I do like the custard more.
But I like them both.
Mmm.
So, we just finished.
We just finished the entire tour.
Time to go home.
Okay, bye guys!
Wait, there's something else?
I just hope they're not like big balls.
[JP] - If they're soaking in cold water
they won't be big balls
(Jian laughs)
- If it's not balls,
I'm going to be like "rats,"
because I really like being right.
Not that I want to eat a ball.
I think this is the last place.
And if you haven't noticed,
Jian is not with us right now.
And I'll tell you why.
Because he's secretively ordering it
without us listening.
There's so many things here
that could be delicious.
Come on!
- I don't think I mentioned it.
I think I just e-mailed it to you,
but we're eating now, the
actual name is Soup # 5.
It's so weird,
they just slapped on a number
on the soup and that's it.
- (singing) One, two, three, four, five
We are gonna eat soup number five.
Oh, here it is!
(adventurous music)
Okay, it looks just like a soup.
So, we're okay.
[Jian] - Let's check what's inside.
That's chicken leg,
you've already had that.
Some chunks of whatever it is.
- It looks like cauliflower.
Is this considered a snack?
[Jian] - It's not a snack.
This is just because I
like you guys so much
I just thought of giving this to you.
Start with the soup itself.
Just the soup, just the liquid.
- I like this.
- Yes, it's good.
That seems kind of gelatinous.
[Jian] - Okay, go!
Come on, Julia!
Oh man, not such a sissy taste.
Come on!
- You never told me what I'm eating!
I'm scared!
[Jian] - It's beef, Julia, it's beef.
Eat the beef.
- I know what it is.
- This is chicken?
- It's a ball.
We're eating balls.
Am I right?
I'm right!
We're eating balls!
[Jian] - That's just soup, Julia.
Eat it, eat it, eat it!
There we go!
- It's good.
The balls.
[Jian] - Congratulations, guys!
You just ate bull testicles!
[JP] - Bull Testicles?
[Jian] - So how was the flavor?
- It kind of was crumbly, fell apart.
[Jian] - It's not complete
if you just eat the balls.
You have to take the shaft as well.
- Oh, that is the (beep).
I ate the (beep).
(Julia laughs)
- Stop!
I feel like this is the
weirdest day of my life!
I was having such a good time.
- I ate the (beep)
I had it kind of marinate
in my mouth a little bit.
And then I realized I'm a
spitter not a swallower.
Julia, can you at least like lick it.
- No, I already tried.
- The fact that it's a penis,
is that what we want to call it?
- Let's just call it a schlong.
- Let's just put it this way.
I don't think it rose to the occasion.
- No, in fact it was a little limp.
This is what I'm realizing.
The flavors are on, I like the broth.
But I cannot get over the fact
that I am chewing on a penis.
- Honestly, if I was going to compare it,
it kind of tastes like a meatball.
You know?
(crickets chirping)
Can we just marvel at the fact
that Jian is not eating the
bull testicle right now?
[Jian] - I'm going to have it!
- Yeah, okay.
[Jian] - I don't know if it
translates well to the video
but basically imagine a shaft like that
so they chop it up in segments
and they cut it down the center
and then it just opens up.
That's what it is right now.
That's half a penis lengthwise.
Here we go, cheers!
It literally tastes like fatty beef.
More jelly, in terms of texture.
The yellow stuff is
literally the testicle.
Inside the testicle.
So, let's eat it up.
Kind of feels like tofu.
- So, in the Philippines,
instead of Viagra,
just eat a penis!
- Yeah, I'd like to congratulate you guys.
(beep) eaters and ball lickers.
(laughter)
All right guys,

See you guys next time.
Another episode.
[Jian] - This used to be
the hangout for the firemen
and some of the proceeds
that this restaurant makes
goes to the volunteer fire association.
So, by eating bull's testicles and penis
you have supported the firemen.
Thank you for your support.
- Any time.
I'll just give them money
if they prefer it, though.
