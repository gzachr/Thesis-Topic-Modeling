put a card up here in the link in the description
i can go check that out uh this is their new
video uh called what so johnny what do you
think about this bro i don't know the thumbnail
looks pretty cool it looks like they have
like uh scaffolding or platforming or something
like that with flags on it with question marks
so i'm not sure exactly what's going to be
going on but it looks like uh like their first
big video yeah for sure you know i'm saying
because uh we reacted to uh what a lab and
that was kind of you know not really a huge
production or anything like that and then
we watched uh that what they're going to do
yeah so we checked both of those out uh really
promising groups so we're kind of excited
to see where they've gone since then that
was a while ago we checked that stuff out
um but i'm not too sure where to go with this
it looks like they're up in the sky like i
don't know in the mountains are behind them
so i'm not really sure exactly where they're
going uh with this but it's a long video it's
like five and a half minutes yeah um maybe
it's like uh maybe it's because it's saying
what like a question you know i'm saying maybe
it's like what else is there to do like what
now you know what i'm saying we're already
at the top you know saying maybe they think
they plateaued or something maybe i don't
know if they really think they plateau but
maybe they feel like they're at the top so
like what else is there what do we have to
do maybe it's what is what do we have to do
yeah so i'm gonna go with something like that
you know what i mean it sounds pretty good
better what i got i really don't have anything
okay well i guess we're gonna get straight
into the video let's see what happens right
now yeah all right here we go
that was insane i was not expecting that at
all what my god that [ __ ] started snapping
oh yeah i was not expecting that was bad ass
i was not expecting that at all that was fantastic
i managed to turn his [ __ ] face and just
started plucking red yeah you're i was like
expected to walk away and all of a sudden
another scene yeah but that dude just turned
around just like started yelling at us yeah
that was
please what is going on this is nothing like
the other two videos you saw this [ __ ] is
ridiculous it's almost like they were like
kids before now they've grown up and they're
like [ __ ] this [ __ ] yeah what what is
going on this is crazy i'm like i'm like blown
away with this [ __ ] right now yeah the way
he's rapping is pretty cool too he's like
adding like some type of effect to his voice
that actually sounds pretty [ __ ] dead no
this is badass i'm i'm happy that it's five
and a half minutes long
got
what
what i want man i tell you what just all the
scenes so far just amazing yeah it's dope
[ __ ] this is like a completely different
group yeah it's that seriously they're completely
different and it's like they have like people
come in and really put thought into what they
were gonna do for this video
foreign
foreign
bro it's just crazy how many different beats
are in one yeah you know what i'm saying like
in this video that's just crazy [ __ ] it
works out like so good because of the transitions
that they do and everything and just the way
that they sing and rap to like the different
types of beats that they have in this video
it just works out really well i tell you what
i'm just still freaking blown away i just
blow away because i remember you know there
are other stuff that we reacted to this is
like just it's a completely different group
100
uh
oh [ __ ]
so that [ __ ] was [ __ ] fire bro this is
like a [ __ ] movie what the [ __ ] i think
that [ __ ] is done but still keep going this
is crazy it's like a music video and then
it's like a performance video and now i wonder
what's going to happen now they about to go
probably beat some ass or something i don't
know about oh no they're about to turn us
into some [ __ ] i'm telling you right now
these guys need to do a video like this every
time this is insane
i feel like he's talking about he's like now
don't tell me what to do
burn
yes
wow
all right that's it go ahead john i'll let
you go first bro that was insane i am completely
still in shock about that video that was nothing
like we saw them before not saying there was
anything wrong with it before just it just
wasn't you know as energetic as that that
was like an amazing video from start to finish
it did just didn't stop anywhere in between
there i mean from the the the seeds the the
locations they were at the the clothes they
were wearing the different outfits the dance
moves oh my god the dancing there's a slow
motion with the dancing them jumping in the
air that was just over the top phenomenal
i'm kind of upset don't even have a million
views yet i know it's been out for for a short
time but that was insane those guys are completely
different from where we first saw them that
was amazing that was completely just amazing
i don't know what else to say that was just
over the top yeah it i was amazed by that
sorry but i was just amazed like that that
was just crazy every every aspect of that
video was amazing yeah that [ __ ] was funny
i really liked the video a lot i really like
their dancing ability in this video it was
just [ __ ] phenomenal it really was and i
really like how the video started off how
they were kind of like walking towards the
camera you know what i'm saying yes and then
they walked past and the guy just [ __ ] turned
his head and just started [ __ ] snapping
he started [ __ ] snapping bro that [ __ ] was
[ __ ] crazy i did not expect that [ __ ] at
all i felt he was like yelling at me i was
like oh [ __ ] this [ __ ] just got [ __ ] real
it's like you just had to listen you're like
oh [ __ ] okay yeah i'll just all don't stop
yeah i was like i need to pause the video
that [ __ ] was crazy as [ __ ] though man
i'll tell you what i feel like uh i really
like this video i really like how much energy
to show this video and just how much uh how
much detail was in this video i feel like
the dancer was phenomenal uh i really like
the transitions to different locations like
johnny said in this video uh everything was
just it was dope as hell it really was the
rapping parts was amazing their vocals were
amazing this group was just like it was like
it was like a totally different group than
what we uh previously react to which obviously
uh the videos was a bad that we previously
reacted to but it was just so much more energy
and so much like more like hard-hitting like
dance moves and stuff in this video it's like
they brought their heart in this one yeah
it was like [ __ ] crazy it was like over
the [ __ ] top it really was but man we definitely
going over that tomorrow sb19 so stay tuned
for that i'm not even done yet this was just
over the time i'm telling you i'm like excited
about this and you know what at the end one
thing i did not say is that the message in
this video is fantastic as well it's almost
like a don't give up message that you keep
going no matter what people think of you just
keep going i mean even us when we react to
the first time we we like them a lot but just
i mean this really shows you what they're
capable of this was amazing yeah now this
day i put this effort every video uh obviously
uh they probably do but i just like this one
a little bit more than the other ones just
because uh i just feel like it had a lot more
energy there's a lot more to actually watch
too because obviously the video was longer
and stuff like that but i just feel like it
was more thought out it was more thought out
like video more thought out process and i
just feel like it was just a lot better you
know what i'm saying yeah but i don't know
