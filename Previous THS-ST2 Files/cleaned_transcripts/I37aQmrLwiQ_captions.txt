You want me to drink that? I thought yeah I drink 
only whole milk. Oh ~ well this is all they had.
Your X.
Hot!
Tamarind.
That smells weird!
My wife is a little hungry today. So we decided 
to, um show her a couple American snacks  
Right now she's snacking. But we're actually 
gonna do ~ Uh, I'm gonna show her like a few ~ 
traditional unhealthy American options for snacks.
And she's going to show me a few options of her 
Filipino ~ Uh common whoa what's going on there?
It's not that kind of film. All right so, yeah 
she's going to show me a few of her Filipino  
snacks that are moderately famous I prepared 
five snacks that um I think it's Filipino famous  
because I think something that I wanna let him try, 
but we never went to a Filipino store so that's  
why there is no such a specific Filipino stuff in 
there, so at least I tried to look for five items.
Right! We did the best we could with our limited 
options. So here in a moment we'll get to uh ~
Try out some real snacks rather than I have 
a snacks American thing omelets in the night!
These are that's my leftovers that she's eating.
Let's let that. All right first 
up, Herejean stop drinking that.
Focus! I'm just kidding. { Okay } No um so first up 
we have a timeless American classic the Oreo. 
You're welcome.
And you can't have Oreos without 
milk. So, I need you to open that.  
It's not two percent I know! I failed. So it's one 
percent low-fat milk. You want me to drink this?  
I thought, Yeah! I drink only whole 
milk. { Oh } Well this is all they had.
Thank you sir!
What I will do for this? Uh ,well Oreos can't 
be eaten without milk that's a Cardinal rule. 
So, you have to dunk the Oreo in the milk. 
Dunk or dip?
Dunk it! What is this? What are you doing? ~ Dip.  Dip.
There you go! It's all yours. 
And that's it? What you eat it?
That's it you eat it and you 
enjoy it! And you're welcome.
That's how you almost eat an Oreo. So this 
is the the proper way of eating the Oreo? 
You don't actually throw the whole Oreo in. You just kind of dip it in. Yeah? So it's like this is the sauce?
That's like the sauce, Yeah! this is how you eat 
an Oreo. In the Philippines we just eat it like this.
I know! You guys are doing it wrong. 
You didn't read the instructions.
Good.
Good? All right next up! Number...
Two! Number two. ~ Another American classic.
Boom!
Cereal. Has to be the cinnamon 
brand. All breakfast? What's this? I love breakfast!
What your talking about? Oreos was it breakfast.
What? You're doing it all wrong. 
All wrong? Just the end part here.
I can't open.
Plenty? ~ You're welcome.
Thank you sir!
More one percent. 
Now before you eat it, have you 
had this cereal before? ~ Yeah! I do.  
This one? ~ Yeah? On this kind of cereal?
No... It's a good stuff. 
For the record, I wanted ~ Waffle 
crisps but I couldn't find them.
This was my second option. I need to soak 
this in a couple of minutes to make it soft?
No that's the worst! You got to eat 
it as crunchy as possible. ~ Yeah? ~ Yeah.
What do we think? I don't like. You don't like? 
No! Get in there you got to do two more at least.  
Before you can judge.
What do you mean you don't like. 
Not much my type.
What? Cinnamon. ~ Yeah! I guess that 
means more for me.
Yeah! So this is all for you. Okay? 
Perfect! All right let's see what's next up.
Behind the scenes!
I can get rid of this. Yeah! because, because I don't like so he's the one who's eating.
Oh yeah!
Number ~
Boom!
But, since it's cinnamon and I know Herejean.
Boom! We chose this option instead.
Be careful it's hot.
So this is strawberry flavor? Yep! So the proper 
eating this one you need to toast it first before  
you eat? ~ Correct!
I mean I don't all the time by 
any means but, it's definitely better toasted. 
Good.
Just sweet. Thank you! You're sweet too.
I think this pop tarts is for the kids! 
No! Not at all. With the sprinklers. 
Yeah, that's strictly for adults. { For adults? }
In my book. And sour too! Sour? Yeah because of 
course strawberry. Right if you were, you know if  
you had better taste buds you would like cinnamon 
but that's okay. I'm working on it. All right rating?
Oreo still my number one. Oreo? ~ All right!
So it's gonna be second. Okay! and third is the ~ 
Life cereal? Yeah! Life cereal. ~ Okay!
We'll see what number four does for you.
Number four!
All of the snacks that you show me is not healthy. 
Yeah! And you're ruining my diet that's why ~ 
What diet?
I'm vegetarian. Oh ~ since when? Just now! Just now?
All right! And give it a shot. Be careful it's hot.
 So guy's, so if you're on diet don't eat 
this it's bad on your diet. Very bad! But it's good.  
So good! So this box is what's 
the purpose of this? To hold it? ~ Yeah!
So fancy ~ I don't used to be fancy!
That's right.
You know ~ You know what I meant? ~ I think so. 
Hot.
Hot.
Yeah? But pretty good? Yeah.
I'm the debating ~ I think 
this is gonna be my number one now. Number one? 
Heck yeah! So hot pockets is my number one. My 
number two now is gonna be the Oreo. Number
three is the pop tarts, and number four is the cereal.
All right let's see what number five is.
Next is a toaster strudel but it says toaster 
scrambler so scrambles. Scrambles crumbled eggs?
Yeah I don't know they used to be breakfast thing 
again? Yeah! I love breakfast. And this is perfect!
This is not snacks this is meal. This is awesome! 
This one guys is toasters crumbled pastries and  
inside of the pastry there is like a 
bacon, eggs, cheese, sauce in the pastry  
crust. That's what it says is in there. So yeah! So 
let's find out I never had this yet and Dominick  
I think this is not the one that he expects.
He got the wrong one. That's the closest I get to it.
Number five!
Yep ~ Number five. So I definitely should 
have toasted it, we don't have a proper  
toaster we have toasted oven. I put in 
the microwave which is a ~ I don't know!
A failed on my part but still can taste 
good. You always failed babe! ~ Thanks!  
At least I admit. Now be careful it's gonna be hot.
So this is a toaster crumble. It's like a 
Starbucks thing you know it's like a Starbucks 
like sandwich in the Starbucks! ~ Yeah? Yeah.
{ Very soup } ~ Very soft!
Very what? ~ Very soft. ~ Very soft? { Yeah! }
What do you think? ~ Wait.
Hot?
A disappointed look? I think still hot 
pockets number one. How does this one ? 
But this gonna be my number two. Really? Okay you 
look much more disappointed for number two ~
You're saying this beats your Oreo but you don't 
look happy? No because, I was thinking which one is
my number one. I feel like this, or the hot pockets. 
Really? So you do like this a lot? ~ Yeah very good?  
Well you've had ~ my five famous 
American snacks. ~ Yeah!
You're welcome! ~ Thank you. 
Hello Dominick! How are you? Are you ready for your 
turn? I am, it's my turn I look exhausted. ~ Yeah?
I've got seven hours to stay awake so, to hit 4 a.m 
for my night shift transition. ~ Yeah! Your eye bag  
is getting bigger now. All right so let's start it.
So here, this is going to be my first item. { Yan Yan } 
A Yan Yan? ~ Yeah! Okay can have a look. You try
it open give it a shot give it a shot? All right.
There's a thing this reminds me of that we 
haven't ~ Did you saw that before? Not this per say ~
We have something very similar it's like a horizontal 
package and has these little sticks in it. But it's  
uh cheese their cheese dip instead of double cream 
chocolate and strawberry. That's the chocolate
