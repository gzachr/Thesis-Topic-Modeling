this floods it's like rainy season 
let's have to nip through the back alley
oh God bless our home  
Philippines Catholic country religious country 
not been to a Catholic country in so long

seems to be the loudest restaurant Eatery in all  
Manila next to the main road yeah which is 
under I think it's uh and we've just got  
so many jeepneys going by we've got a bit of a 
local breakfast brunch of Tapsilog and Tocilog

pesos so I mean you can't go wrong with that  
can you it's a super local spot look there's 
local people eating it it's like a bar Style  
and in the back it's just a few ladies just
