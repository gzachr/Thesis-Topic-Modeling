that's likely motive did you just make a
noise in there can you make that noise
again can you tap on something
it's pretty creepy I was just thinking
other other ones
hi guys thank you for tuning in to Amy's
Crypt today we are investigating one of
the most notorious and haunted places in
the Philippines the Malinta Tunnel
before we get into investigating Malinta
Tunnel I just wanted to let you know
that this video was made in
collaboration with one of my favorite
YouTube channels the Paranormal Scholar
I will be linking this channel below and
highly recommend you check out their
content after this video particularly if
you want to learn more about Corregidor
Island where Malinta Tunnel exists the
Paranormal Scholar will have a full
video detail in the dark history and
hauntings of the island on their Channel
in the coming days now back to the video
hi guys so I wanted to just fill you in
on this Malinta Tunnel before I go in we
went to what we believe was the front
entry which our the lady at the hotel
told us to go to to enter and we got
told it's locked to go around so we
hiked up a big hill
for maybe a good half hour like really
steep hill we get to the other entrance
there's no one here but the door is just
a jar and open so we don't actually know
for allowed to go in with no one but
there's no one here and we come all this
way so I'm just gonna go in for a peek
so we have no idea what the light switch
is and this is our dark Adair you can
see how long the tunnel is down the
other end
so as to say we walk down there I'm
gonna speak really softly because it's
super echo Ian yeah okay guys we're just
gonna walk down the middle of this
tunnel and this is supposed to be one of
the most haunted places on Corregidor
Island in the Philippines
it's a massive tunnel it has been used
as storage for military you know all
their equipment and stuff has been used
as a 1,000 bed hospital bomb shelter so
there was a lot of bombs dropped on this
island during World War two and this was
one of the places where people will seek
refuge there's also been a lot of death
here
so besides it being used as a military
hospital this island was taken from the
United States by the Japanese and then a
few years later the u.s. actually
claimed it back and at that time there
was a lot of Japanese soldiers hiding
out in here and it said that instead of
surrendering and admitting defeat from
Japanese soldiers had the philosophy
back then it was better to die than it
was to surrender so apparently there was
actually a mass suicide I believe it was
about 3,000 Japanese soldiers in here
and what they did was literally detonate
all their explosives and I don't think
I've ever excavated all of the tunnel to
remove the bodies or anything like that
so that's a little bit of the rundown of
the history on this tunnel so it makes
sense that it is a haunted place now
basically the tunnel is one long stem
through the middle of a mountain but
then there's other stems that are
smaller coming off of each side of it I
think that we've actually found
so I'm gonna go have a look in in that
Jarrad just told me - so you mean on this
lamp because it's actually moving it is
swaying it's no air movement in here Oh
however
is there someone in here with us
can you make that lamp move more can you
make a noise
that is pretty creepy that was just
spinning other other ones no I'm just
zooming out and we are actually behind
over it yeah that's a completely aligned
India I can't feel any wind or anything
that would be making that move I'm also
not going to go in there they have a
light and sound show that goes off in
here
so I guess they you know you have sound
effects and lights all rigged up in
there
for shows like that I say we keep going
for over down the tunnel when maybe we
come back and see if that still swinging
when we get back okay see here's another
one that we kind of missed when we first
walked past yeah it's got um figures of
people representing kind of what it
would have been like in here it actually
looks like there's a little church down
the end there's all these cute little
bats on the roof stop shining birds
did you just make a noise in there can
you make that noise again
that doesn't look safe to enter so the
scientist has welcome headquarters of
General George Moore
but I think it was like so actually
right how this place was made was kind
of a makeshift uncle sorts of techniques
and like leftover explosives and all
this other stuff that they had
you know this tunnel going up into these
side ones I don't know how safe
everything is because you're gonna
remember when the Japanese you know
committed suicide they dedicated all
their leftover explosives the time
system down here probably was a little
fast nice tonight it looks like this is
I said this looks pretty graphic this
island Corregidor was an important place
during World War Two there was a lot of
battles fought here as I mentioned
earlier was occupied by the United
States and Japan and then the United
States again and there was a lot of US
soldiers Japanese soldiers as well as
Filipino soldiers that died here and I
mean this was a 1,000 bed hospital
that's a lot of beds
I don't wanna get locked in it you know
it's bad
we yeah that we're gonna get locked in
now
so let's just keep an eye on back to I'm
pretty sure that that was a cat this
hasn't always coming from down yeah very
likely could be a bat he says someone
down there can't make a noise
you look like Japanese soldiers right so
maybe that was destroyed the spices what
set off maybe
it's just okay
Hoshi Japanese soldiers are entombed
there's likely a lot of dead bodies in
there
well Jesus
one of these are like completely
destroyed
that's like playing right
go back ok guys so we just walked down
the big tire make a ton of women around
I seen some of the lateral tiles which
are the ones that span off of this and
it's very creepy and interesting and I
mean just to think how many people would
have died in this tunnel system
thousands of people not only from the
Japanese mass suicide but also the
people that were here being treated for
wounds in the hospital
this place was a 1,000 bed hospital and
I think we're gonna go up here why don't
I start quiet spot and try and reach out
and see if we can communicate
you can't see something moving
EVP
okay
right guys we are standing in the dark
in the middle of the winter top tunnel
of Corregidor Island in the Philippines
it's a very haunted location I'm going
to start calling out we're gonna conduct
an EVP session I am NOT going to use my
spirit box in here because this place is
insanely echoey I can't even begin to
imagine what it would have been like
when I was the people bunked up here at
whilst bombs were dripping on the island
but I'm gonna reach out I'm gonna reach
out in English there was a lot of US
soldiers that would have died here and
Mays haunt this tunnel as well as
Filipinos and Japanese if I'm gonna
reach either English because that's the
language that I speak
hello my name is Amy if there are any
spirits in this tunnel that wish to
communicate can you please come forward
and make your presence known
yeah I go to make a noise or come close
and tell us your name
we joined the war
we here because your engine
can you tell us your name
can you tell us your age or anything
about yourself
that's definitely noises coming from the
end of the tunnel it could be having
this big steel doors looking either end
of the tunnel introduce a wind or the
middle flexing with dropping horizon
temperature can you make a noise for us
can you tap on something
what country are you from
there has to be the door waxing
we in this tunnel when the bombs were
dropping on the island
what year was it when you here
it's definitely not someone down there
making that noise good to be here alone
and we would see like feet free the
bottom off the light coming under the
door it was
can you say hello to me
can you give me any sign that there's
someone yeah
Shaner up so we just looking a bit
further up now we're gonna try another
experiment oh yeah
actually guys you know what I just hit
record am I gonna do it guys - obsession
in the militant or awful Philippines I
should say I really come up with me out
on screen and I'm just gonna break down
this way and see if we pick up any words
or fluctuations in the magnetic field
come close to me if there's someone yeah
that's a torch
come close to me if there's someone here
that's gay Gregory is that your name
well it's name was that headquarters

that's fine
Gregory or anyone else here could you

what country are you from
I just heard something behind you
howdy
when we inside this time what yeah
and I stopped recording those - yeah
so it's been all right we good they got
nothin else away okay there's been all
sorts of paranormal phenomena reported
within this tunnel anything you can
think of really we've had voices when no
one is around as well as footsteps
there's been full-bodied apparitions
mists forming people hearing people cry
out as if they're trapped
there's been no people I felt as if
they've been touched suddenly dropping
temperatures poltergeist activity
there's been all sorts of things
happening this tunnel and it is actually
a very terrifying place especially when
paired with
the real history of how bloody this
Islanders and in particular how bloody
the past of this tunnel is we just left
the tunnel you know it actually just
sounded like a missile went off over
there I didn't actually know what that
sounds like outside of like Hollywood
movies you did that too right yeah maybe
it was like sank like a boat doing
something I could hear about yeah I
don't know what that was a powerful you
