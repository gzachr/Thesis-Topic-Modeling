food that they prepared but anyway it's about time  
you know try this out like next level adulting has 
filipinos just in general next level check this  
out that's a totally ample right there right there

nice to lock the cannon and then this is just 
to start it or turn it off or change the flame

was really hoping to go down to the beach  
so we just came back from the car i had to put 
away my book um because i didn't want it to get  
rained on anyway uh isabel what are you doing 
i'm trying to put this part of the branch down  
okay um but as you can see i look like i'm doing 
like some kind of nature exclusive with my hat

picnic and i just happen to be wearing  
like a nature hat and jacket but as you 
can see from my jacket as well as the fern  
it is raining because yay we're in vancouver and 
that's kind of what happens did you get to eat  
yeah do you think you're gonna get something at 
the concession stand maybe but we're gonna go  
to the beachfest yeah oh let's go this way yeah 
isabel um is like a vegetarian um kind of she  
does eat meatballs but for the most part she is 
a vegetarian okay hold my hand she's a vegetarian  
so she's uh she's not gonna be eating the steak 
and the pork that um we've got on the grill  
anyway hold on watch out for 
bikes good we're good we're good
yes we're gonna head back see like it's 
already stopped raining and it's already  
sunny again there were these people who were 
actually um having a picnic right beside us  
and they packed up as soon as it started raining 
which is such a shame the rain does the rain does  
go away eventually if you wait and if you're 
patient long enough there it is sunny again
there's us right over there oh we have finally 
turned off the grill sorry because um yeah  
this is like filipino style it's like well 
done um but we forgot to bring the vinegar  
which is like goes really well with 
this kind of steak and some rice

know i didn't know okay
i just see it on instagram all the 
time you know like this i just i'm just  
this an adidas girl she just does 
all this cool stuff and i'm like
no seriously isaiah when i was your age i 
think i lost friends because i was so bad at it
let's all go down and leave me
hi okay where are we going finally how 
long have you been waiting do you think um  
i don't know probably about what like five hours 
yeah here we are okay one sec oh it's a low tide  
be careful watch your stuff oh 
it's i think that's a crab leg  
wow look at all these shells and seaweed you don't 
usually get to see all the stuff because it's  
usually high tide when we come over here
oh
it's a bit uh cold out still 
but how can you say no to um
ice cream by the beach what 
are we waiting for more food  
and more stuff dino king by 
the way we're presenting some
packed up our stuff and decided to relocate 
because just a few meters away is um the beach  
the actual beach and it is low tide right 
now i'm going to show you just in a second  
it's low tide it's there's barely any people down 
here um i've never seen it this empty usually by  
the summer time this place is like you can barely 
find an inch nice to put down a blanket or even  
just plop yourself and be able to sand castle 
with your kids so we're taking advantage of it
oh what is that it's wet moisture it's wet sand oh
look at that that is real gold
