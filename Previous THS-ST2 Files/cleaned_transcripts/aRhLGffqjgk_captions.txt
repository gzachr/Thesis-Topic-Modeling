all right
But a lot of y'all been asking
About the first listen for the love yourself tear album and I said that I wouldn't really have, time cuz
of travel, which I didn't and now that i'm not at
My house right now at this moment i'm in a hotel I already told some of y'all that's been
Asking that I already listen to it so what's the point of a first listen I expressed
What I liked on twitch twitter instagram this isn't really a first listen this is more like jamming out to BTS love
Yourself tear, while my family is sleeping in the hotel bathroom, no it's not gonna be too loud I already tested it out
There's like, two tvs over there so it's kind of like drowned out so if someone just comes in to use the bathroom
just broke the toilet i'm not gonna lock this door so whoever comes in joins in in the party hopefully, no one comes in
well my, dad came in to pee
He, did pee to singularity so it probably
Was a really nice pee all right let's start this this is a first listen video but not really
Cuz i already explained myself that i listened to this like one time two time three time if i made a playlist that mean that i already listened to it a lot
and i really like your sooooooongs and albuuuuum        (this was so hard lol)
yeah
The album has one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven
Songs it's 44 minutes long i got mine on apple music, song i've been playing
Like over and over is paradise, love maze ,airplane part 2, and anpanman?
No, i haven't seen the performances yet i might do a
Live reaction on my twitch channel that's JREgaming go follow, me there
No, but first up is singularity yall one thing, about Taehyung voice is like
It's like i don't know I was about to say warm butter but its just like it just cuts
have my heart basically this is the song that, my dad was peeing to
Uhh he was like, oh?
hm
I feel, like this type of song where you were like
Ballroom dance or just dance with your significant other you know the lyrics might not match up
That's the walmart version of the music video
listen, we all right now i am a V stan 
so when they came out with this ish I was in the efhbvej
I just love V's voice is just so unique
Got a hella cramp im getting too old to body roll man yo man my back
I was trying to go hella hard on these body rolls and i got cramped up it's been a minute y'all
Yo one of my favorite parts, is the rap line in the song
Cramped (??) i think you need to stretch before you body roll
Congrats to bts for top social artist again
And they get to perform fake love yall on a different level fam more eyes are looking at you bts i don't know
That means i feel like, that's good but it's, also a lot, more pressure so as fans you know
We got show, support next song, is the truth untold featuring Steve Aoki, now this song actually really caught me off guard
Cuz, when you see the name Steve Aoki. You think hyped ass music
hits hmm...hits that ish
Even like without looking up the lyrics you can feel how heart felt it really is
Like emotional it is and now, after looking at the lyrics it just you just connected with it more, i dont know
it's like it's like, you put this into every situation like, like your life in high school when you're going through a breakup
going through a loved one that just didnt work
You know it just didn't work out
its an emotional rollercoaster and  that's why i think i like it too because i like that kind of stuff too
whew damn
I still want you (makes me cry every time)
That's enough,  i'm about to cry
i don't, want to cry, right now 1 3 4 3 4 0 isn't that the coordinates of pluto?
thats just groovy, ass song just with the beat on its own
its a groovy, ass song paradise this is one of my favorites from the albu m
this gets me in the mood got that army vibe it's sexy let, me just play so i could go erbgoerthb (same)
Definitely one of my favs its always gonna be on repeat for me
It's already on a playlist it's definitely one my favorite songs did i say it again? it's definitely one my favorites
Love maze is definitely another one of the faves just because just let's just  let it drop
Again, one of the faves please do if you're watching this right now
Please comment what's your favorite, song you can say the whole album if you want you know no pressure no pressure
We got the magic shop
This, song in general makes you go on a freaking journey
oof so angelic yo
The way they bring it up in that drop
I feel like i'm like it's not, my first time listen to it actually this just has been a minute so i'm like, oh
It's funny you think this song would be like the steve aoki, song but, no steve aoki song
Is the one the one that threw me off when I first listened to this magic shop though so i'm about to
Show, you the song that caught me off guard because it was like the first, song I listened to cuz
Everybody, was hyping this up let's get this shiz?
Yo when I first, I don't know if you seen my post but when I first heard this this sh*t caught me off guard how
Sexy and like the latin vibe that you oof you wouldn't. Like miami or some ish
Either way it's one of my favorite tracks as well airplane part 2 was good boo?
So this song I played for my dad in the car. And he was all about that this is anpanman
hold up
I just, wanna say the fact that it was V in the very beginning almost sounded like fetty wap for a second i was like what the hell but i love it
I don't know if you're going to their concert, that's coming up i don't know
If you got tickets but if you do go get them because i already know. This is gonna be hype (i wish ;__;)

No, lie this is not, my first listen i have listened to this but yo anyways I hope you guys
Enjoyed this video i know it's been late
I didn't do a first listen because i already listened to the album so what's the purpose of the first listen but
This, is me jamming in the bathroom of a hotel
Bathroom with, my family sleeping outside
They, can't hear me i think that i think i'm droned out to be honest I hope you enjoyed that
