We're at Jollibee's
we're here in the Philippines so we had
to try jollibees it's a local favorite
locally based fast-food restaurants that
we're gonna try jolly bees in the
Philippines
they have a pineapple burger
they have a lot of different things we're going to have a problem here.
now we have some help, now we know what
to order
definitely chicken but also the yum burger
can we order... ummmm
you wanted the pineapple burger right?
yeah! the Aloha burger
Jolliee spaghetti, you want pieces of chicken?
do you recommend anything else?
oh the peach mango pie?
we got a bunch of different things this
all came in a meal
we have the pasta
with the spaghetti
we have a Salisbury
steak
we have the chicken which is what
they're famous for
maybe should have
gotten more
but I think we have ourhands full with what we've got
we have rice
which we're in Asia so that comes
with everything and then we got a
dessert which is a..
peach mango pie
and then
french fries and then this Aloha burger
which comes with a pineapple which I'm
excited to try
I like pineapple on pizza I know some
people don't like that I like pineapple
on lots of things this has bacon on it
which makes it even better and a little
cheese
that is good
got the sweet from the pineapple
this is a good combination of savory and
sweet bacon cheese burger beef got
everything that you wanted a nice sesame
seed bun with tons of sesame seeds on it
it's really nice as they gave us proper
utensils to use and cups so there's
minimal throwaway waste you notice that
the very conscience is about their waste
here in the Philippines which is great
this is a routine fixture in many school
lunches so I kind of have a scary
history with this but we'll try and
we'll think let's see if it's good
and it tastes like Salisbury steak or
when I remember it's salty got some
mushrooms in it the sauce is actually
nicer than the meat i think
which is ground beef patty and i think it's  the same
that was on the burger
I think you're supposed to eat it with the rice so
maybe we'll mix it together because the
sauce is really salty and I think with
the rice that will kind of help flavor
the rice perhaps and we just mix it in
and you have a little rice with our salt
berry steak so now it becomes more of a
rice dish with some seasoned beef and
gravy and mushrooms and that looks about
right
oh that's nice now I got a little more
mushroom with that bite it's actually
quite good and then we will try the
spaghetti which has hotdogs in it and
some cheese I think we saw pasta on the
McDonald's menu too didn't we
so I believe that this is just a popular
dish here full of pasta with a little
hot dog on the end big bite
oh and
that's really good
sweet this has a little kick on the end
of it a little bit spicy and a little
salt from the hot dog little tangy not
like a marinara sauce or anything like
that it's a little more robust I like
that you can see why that's very popular
I'm saving the chicken for the laughs I
don't know what the gravies maybe the
gravies for the fries or the chicken
let's try some with the fries and be
like almost a pool if you're Canadian
well yeah that's like a poutine
so that's a moat right if you're
Canadian the chicken we gotta eat fast
cuz Naz is getting hungry
I don't know
what this is
it this a wing or?
I don't know.. JUST EAT IT
so now we know why jollibees is famous
this is I think a half chicken breast
and it's really just juicy inside
you know why I'm how chicken breast is
sometimes dry this was like the juice
came out almost to the side of my mouth
hot, crispy
it's a really nice fried chicken and we
eats unfortunately a lot of fried
chicken or I do
Naz keeps force-feeding me as fast as she can
because she wants me to get through this
so she can eat hungry this is the peach
and mango pie
everything is getting cold too
NOT THAT !!
so I burned the tip of my
tongue which is what you want with the
pie it's nice and hot I actually have a
nice pineapple drink this is nice too
this is very nice
I don't know what to say you can taste
the peach in mango individually crispy
on the outside not soft and mushy pie is
just the filling is just great a little
bit of tangy little bit of sweet very
very nice good job jolly bees
what did you do?
had a gravy accident
oh man!
thanks
there's still some left
know what I'm going to try some of the
crust first just to try that chicken
not all of it a little bit
It's very flakey
yeah, it's seasoned really well
same with the gravy
oh the gravy is good
or what's left of it
alright let's put this down let's finish
the rest because we haven't eaten
THE PIE THE PIE
this is peach and mango
jolliebees have got it right
I would definitely come back for this
it's super like Ooozey and gooey
okay so we are pretty full after all
that food I was a pretty big meal now I
think I show it on the cash register but
the entire meal rang up to about six
dollars and seventy cents so all in all
pretty good value for what we spent
again it was really good really full I
have to say the staff here is really
enthusiastic and energetic as you've
seen and so thank you to those guys for
