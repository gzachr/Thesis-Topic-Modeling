If we added seafood instead of chicken breast 
it's the same as we ate then

Really delicious can i be a chef?

It's hot because eat too hard
no need to say.. but how was it
 
just watch this
 
i didnt like curry before.
but i m in love with coconut curry
 
regular curry has a strong scent, flavor
 
but coconut curry is softer than regular curry because of eggs, coconut milk
and creamy texture
was so nice
my best curry!
if ingredients are changed 
new taste is expected everytime
pork seafood.. etc
i ll enjoy this curry like that
so it was nice
