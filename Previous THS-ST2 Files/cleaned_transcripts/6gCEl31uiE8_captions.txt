I don't know but I think they could have
made it without the tip that thing is
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
weird now we're going to go to Mall of
Asia get some coffee which I haven't had
this morning two we're going to go buy
some supplies we'll find something at
mall of Asia and then we'll come back
here cool thing they have a freeze
shuttle bus that runs every 30 minutes
every day to Mall of Asia so
[Music]
perfect thank
you I wanted to get the whole I'm
leaving a bus and thank you and the guy
goes H and he didn't even look at me so
we're at The Mall of Asia but instead of
bringing you to every store we visited
I'm going to cut to the highlights you
won't have to sit through Michel trying
on every piece P of clothing at all the
stores like I
did every single store has a door man as
long as it has a door even
jollybee benches in the mall are always
occupied you snooze you
lose so we've made it to the eyeglass
store where might go probably buy some
contact lenses if not then we have to
continue to look which I don't want to
do so hopefully you don't even need to
get a prescription to get cont lenses
you can buy them at every eyewear store
makes it easy for travelers and it
should increase sales all right so Mich
got her contact
lenses can't forget about local
Philippine Brands like Watson's bench
jollybee and my favorite
[Music]
KKK I love them all just like anyone but
I think Filipino people really really
love them all they're just like so many
people people hanging out maybe it's cuz
of the free internet I don't know but
they're just hanging
[Applause]
out every entrance has a security check
don't get freaked out about the guns
it's pretty standard here you eventually
get used to
it MOA has a giant supermarket and the
fruit selection is amazing plus they
have a lot of other cool
stuff and lots and lots of beers funny
thing is Japanese beer is cheaper in the
Philippines than Japan check out this
can of
asah this is good for you
I and finally if you want to get some
good old American buffalo wings you can
find it here too so we're at Buffalo
Wild Wings next to the Conrad hotel by
all of Asia but this place is freaking
cool it has monitors everywhere if you
want to watch the sports show you should
watch it here see you next game bye bye
thank you see you next G all right so
we're all packed and ready to go back to
the
[Applause]
