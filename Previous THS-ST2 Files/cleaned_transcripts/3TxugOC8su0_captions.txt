Edith M. - This is good!
I don't think we did that right.
No, this is so strong.
I love your hedgy!
Together: MORE SNACKS!
It's like a little yellow poop on it.
Together: Hey guys!
I'm Veronica.
I'm Vanessa.
And today, we are gonna be trying Filipino snacks.
As some of you may know, we went to YouTube FanFest in Manila, Philippines,
and we got a lot of gifts at our meet and greet.
So we were going to be opening those up on camera and
Trying the snacks you guys gave us and reading your letters and then opening all this stuff.
Yes, and if you want to see our vlog from YouTube FanFest we posted it on our second channel.
So go watch that and see how our trip was. It was absolutely amazing.

Yes, so let's get on with the video.
[Grunt] Alright!
So, this is the box that we put all of your gifts in that we got from the Philippines.
We actually put it on the airplane with us and brought it all the way home to LA.
And we are going to open it up and look at all your gifts, but a little side note,
we had to consolidate some of the gifts because not all of them could fit in this box so-
But our mom did that so thanks Mama Merrell.
Yes. But so, uh, the gifts might be a little, um...
Scattered in together so but yes, so we're gonna look at them now.
It's a purple box.
Together: It's a squishy duck!
[Laughs] Look!
Squish, squish.
These bracelets, oh wait, what, how does that happen?
"Wishful Merrell loves you."
Together: Thank you, Wishful Merrell!
[Awe] Oh my goodness! It's a kittyyyy!
Aww! That's for, I think it's for you, Nessa.
Aw, it says, "From Janina!"
Awww!
Janina, Janina, you also got me a hedgy. Look how cute it is.
I love you hedgy!
[Sigh] Oh my gosh!
What is this?
Looook! It's a panda!
With the note.
Both: Thank you, Kyle ten!
Just another warning that the bags in the box were kind of sideways. So things have fallen out.
So if we don't get your full gift, it's in the box somewhere.
It's somewhere.
This says from Deano, thank you so much!
We saw Deano a lot while we're in the Philippines.
Deano was so kind to give us some snacks to try on camera.
This is called po, pachy? Poachy?
Poachy.
Roni: Are you ready?
Nessa: I'm scared.
Cheers! Why are you scared?
Mmmm!
You don't like it?
Okay, I like it now.
They're really yummy!
I get really scared at artificially flavored strawberry flavor.
Why?
I don't know.
What do you mean?
It's strawberry cream.
Let's try some Ding Dongs! [Laughs]
What in the world, are those peas?
I want to try the same flavor as your.
Nessa: Wait, what?
Roni: What flavor is this?
I'm ready to try this.
Ooh, ooh! Anything with peas in it. I'll take!
Both: Cheers!

I think it's a yam.
It's not bad. It's just different.
I don't know. Is it like a ring pop?
They look like Ring Pops.
They're rings.
[Laughs]

It's a lot of sugar. But I like this one.
This one's really yummy. This is milk powders?
Whey and milk powder.
Straws.
There's no obstructions either.
Oh no! I opened it on accident. I think what you're supposed to do is you're supposed to put this in water.
I'm gonna Google it.
Oh, you eat it like powder!
So then what's this straw for?
They literally did it like this.
They have like-
Roni: Have it like this.
Is she's sucking the powder through the straw?
She is.
Okay. Are you ready?
Wait, wait, don't breathe it in.
No, you can't breathe it in!
It's like block it with your tongue.
