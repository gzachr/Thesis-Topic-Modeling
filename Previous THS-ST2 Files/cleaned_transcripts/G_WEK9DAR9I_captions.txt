good morning this is randall meek with the 
philippines project and just wanted to do a  
quick video this morning um you know at this point 
not really even sure of the title um it's been a  
i haven't uploaded a video in a couple of days 
and i have been pretty consistent uh missed a  
day or two over the last week but i just wanted 
to reach out to the subscribers and you know a  
few weeks ago i couldn't say that but you know the 
channel is growing and i'm pretty excited about it  
and i appreciate all the comments and and i even 
got a new comment a new subscriber this morning  
here in the philippines it's uh i think it's what 
about maybe seven o'clock here in the morning on  
thursday and so if you're watching from the 
watching this from the u.s you know we're  
we're ahead of you right now so 13 hours ahead 
if you live in the midwest so anyway uh yeah  
i haven't uploaded a video in a couple of days 
actually how do i i don't want to i don't want  
to overstate this i i had a little bit of a 
health scare just you know kind of an internal  
thing i don't think it's really was anything 
serious but i did go to the doctor here in the  
philippines and so you know that's that's always 
quite an experience i've been a few times probably  
since 2007 and all my trips i've probably been to 
the doctor four times five times seem like every  
every trip i i'll make some kind of trip to the 
doctor you know it's uh it's part of life when  
you're 60 years old sometimes and i'm really been 
on a kind of a mission trying to get the light a  
little bit better but uh yeah kind of been on a 
mission to actually really work on my health here  
sorry about that and so so yeah i've 
you know i've been eating right and  
i really think what's going on i went to the 
doctor and and so i i didn't have a blood pressure  
monitor here and you know i take i take 
blood pressure medication probably like  
some of you guys uh or ladies if you 
don't have a blood if you if you don't uh  
know what your blood pressure is i suggest 
you get it taken because you know they call  
it silent killer right because you never know 
you have high blood pressure people think oh  
i'm feeling funny i have high blood pressure 
you're never going to get that feeling you're  
just not going to get it because it'll it will it 
will not tell you ahead of time what i actually  
have experienced uh this time is low blood 
pressure and i believe it's because i've really  
tried to eat better i've cut myself off from a lot 
of the foods that i used to eat back in the states  
and uh just eating a lot of mangoes 
bananas a lot of fresh vegetables and rice  
and really cut out a lot of meat uh i love meat 
you know don't get me wrong uh i love it but  
you know i've cut out a lot of it and it's 
it's a little more expensive here uh it's  
not more expensive here than it is in the states 
i don't think but what i'm saying is as far as  
the food prices go it's about the most expensive 
thing you can buy ground beef is is a little bit  
hard to find and uh so it's it's more expensive 
and then you know you can get ground pork but  
you really shouldn't be eating that either but 
you know you do what you want to do i've had some  
medical history and i've had some uh circulation 
issues i had actually i had a what they call i'm  
gonna i'm gonna say it wrong but i'm gonna say an 
endartectomy and that means they they took my vein  
on this side of my head the blood the the vein 
that goes to the artery that goes to my brain they  
they cut it open cleaned it out and zipped it back 
up so that was been about four 2014 or 15 and so  
i've been on blood pressure medication i've been 
on uh blood thinners and stuff like that and you  
know if you met me you'd never know you know but 
uh you know it was a pretty trying time in my life  
back then so anyway back to the healthy part of it 
i'm trying to trying to be healthy and i haven't  
even walked to the market in the last couple days 
so today i did i i got out and i walked walked to  
the the market or the palenque this morning and 
and felt pretty good felt pretty good and actually  
i took a uh we call it down here in iloilo we call 
it a c-cod i don't know what people call it other  
places but i took a it's a bicycle with a side car 
and i just put my my food items in there let's see  
i got fresh coconut juice the guy actually had 
just got done filling the bag from the coconut  
and poured it in a bag and i got two bags and i 
like to i like to hit two of those a day i put  
them in the refrigerator let them get cold and 
that's that's just a health regimen i've kind  
of got on i missed the last couple days but i 
was running low on fruits and vegetables so i  
had to go had to go to the palanqui this morning 
and get that it's the coolest time of the day  
kind of really beautiful out here in the morning 
in in pavia in the iloilo province it's it's humid  
but it's a lot cooler than it's going to be later 
on so yeah i enjoy getting out in the morning  
you know you you walk to town walk to the plaza 
and you see everybody and they all say good  
morning and you know pretty much i'm not going to 
say everybody knows me here but everybody on my  
route to the palenque and back pretty much knows 
who i am they know where i live so anyway uh yeah
so yeah it's a it's a real pleasant experience 
you know to walk to the to the plaza uh here in  
pavia they're getting ready for the uh the 
carabao race i guess it's uh i think uh  
oh don't get me don't give me the lie in here but 
i heard something and then you comment down there  
if i'm wrong but it's one of the oldest fiestas 
in the philippines in pavilla it's a carabao  
festival and every year uh and i can't give you 
the date i think it's the third or the fourth  
they're going to have they're going to have guys 
they're going to jump on the back of a carabao  
and they're going to race and they do that other 
places in the philippines but it's kind of famous  
here and so and i've seen it uh one time one time 
so it's just kind of a this video is just kind of  
a hodgepodge of things that's going on but but in 
the plaza they're building up all the uh vendors  
places they'll have a big arena outdoor arena and 
it's one of these nights before too long they're  
going to have a bunch of entertainment in there 
and you can go there and you can rent a table  
and you get so many sand mig lights and maybe 
a chicken or something like that and some rice  
and it's pretty good time so yeah that's what 
we're getting ready for it's going to be next  
week early next week so we're going to be in the 
thick of that and if you're in the philippines you  
know what it's like being in a in a town that's 
while the fiesta is going on it's funny here you  
know it seems like from an american point of view 
and let me stress that i don't think that's always  
the right point of view but i'm just saying as an 
american and and my perspective it seems like uh  
at first glance people take off a lot of work here 
you know and it's like oh well one of my brothers  
he hasn't worked for a week because they're having 
a fiesta in another town where he works well  
the workers that work in that town they're not 
going to come to work because they've got the  
fiesta going on and i don't know if they take 
off two three days whole week who knows but  
fiesta time even in the homes everybody you know 
everybody they cook people stop by you get a lot  
more visitors everybody's off work it's just like 
a big long weekend uh it's like a memorial day  
weekend or whatever you want to call it it's 
just a time where they celebrate you know but  
but on the subject of i said people take off more 
here and they do but you know i was talking to my  
wife last night and and i was just observing the 
family and and my brother-in-law one of them has  
not been working that much but you know he's here 
at the house and downstairs where he lives and  
his his daughter and son and other daughter he's 
got two daughters and one son and you know i told  
my wife i said flora i said you know we look at 
that like oh how come they don't work every day  
and then i thought i told her i said you know 
there's something actually nice about that and  
now granted they missed some income and uh you 
know that's you know that's a consideration that's  
part of what goes on but uh actually you know i 
told told my wife i said you know i didn't get to  
spend that much time with my dad when i was that 
young and and so you know there's a benefit there  
they they put a high priority on family and 
they spend a lot of time with each other  
here where i live it's it's me and my 
wife laura we live on the second floor  
of our house and uh downstairs there's two 
families laura's two brothers and their wives  
and their children so we've got three on one 
side and uh four on the other side children  
live downstairs in the apartment or whatever so 
there's you know there's activity going on around  
here and you know they they really respect our 
privacy but you know people pop in and out at the  
house and and they don't come up here and take 
over they're not up here begging for anything  
i mean we have a good family here and we 
enjoy it so but you know the point of it is  
you know they may not work all the time but 
you know there's a real sense of family here  
in the philippines and you know that's the one 
point even if i don't have a point for a video  
you know that's why i'm passionate about the 
philippines there's so many things like that you  
know the the commitment to family and and just the 
family atmosphere here they depend on one another  
they look out for one another they look out for 
me you know and so that's something that's missing  
you know back in the united states and and there's 
some good families back there and my family's a  
good family but you know we lose touch you know 
and we're spread out throughout the country and  
you know it's just a fact of life that's 
the way it is i'm not saying it's right  
or wrong but it is the way it is and and 
so you don't you don't have that family uh  
like you do here now on the flip side of that coin 
a lot of a lot of filipinos a lot of filipino guys  
you know they end up going abroad and working 
and that's really tough and i my hat you know  
is off to those people my wife was one of those 
she she went off to work in singapore for about  
eight or nine years and just sent money back 
home to the family to to help them and and all  
that so that's that's kind of how they live here 
but but anyway uh i'm trying to get healthy um  
i am i'm working on it i've got a set of 
steps here i walk up and down steps every day  
we've got three floors so it's 31 steps i counted 
one way so even if i don't try to exercise  
and i do any kind of activity at all here at 
the house i'm going to be walking up steps  
so so yeah it's i get a little more exercise 
i think i've dropped some weight since i've  
been here but i don't have any scales 
but i know my clothes fit a lot looser  
i'm enjoying it uh yeah so i'm enjoying it here
