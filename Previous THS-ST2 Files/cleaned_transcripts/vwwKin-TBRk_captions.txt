Hello!
Today,
I'm going to do a reaction
about Shila Amzah
who sang
a Filipino song that was
originally sang by a Filipino singer,
Yeng Constantino.
So, there.  I am very proud
because a Malaysian
was able to sing a
Filipino song and
she was able to sing it beautifully.
just like a...
her voice is.....
she sang it well, the diction,
the pronunciation of the
Filipino words
she got them right.
Then,
let's hear this guys.
I'm very appreciative
 
because a Malaysian
sang a Filipino song.
So, thank you so much
Shila Amzah
for singing
a very famous Filipino song
 
This song was originally
sang by Yeng Constantino
 
a very good and also famous Filipino
songwriter and singer.
So now, let's watch Shila Amzah.

ohhoooh....
 
 
aaahaaah....
 
At the ticking of time
it's you that I'm thinking of
I can't stop the beating
of my heart.
You are the one
 
I'm wishing for
Eversince I
realized
That one
day
my heart
would love.
 
 
You are the one
that I waited for.
 
My heart has
grieved for so long
But now
you are here
You are the love
That was given to
me by the heavens
 
You are the grace in my life
You are
my happiness
and
my love.
 
 
 
 
oooh oooh.....
oooh oooh ooh.....
 
 
Whenever I see you
time freezes
 
and the world stops
spinning
 
My heart
willfully smiles
After the question
was anwered
 
I remember
back then
When I wondered
when anyone would
truly love me.
 
 
You are the love
that I
waited for
My heart
has grieved
for so long
But now
you are here.
You are
the love
that was given
to me by
the heavens
You are the grace
in my life
You are my  happiness
and my love.
 
And I haven't
loved
 
like this
 
and
in my mind
I think of
being with you
For the rest
of my life.
 
You are
the love
that I waited for
My heart
has grieved for
so long
But now
you are here
You are
the love
that was given to me
by the heavens
You are the
grace
in my life
You are my happiness
and my love.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
You are the
love that
was given to me
by the
heavens
My heart has grieved for
so long
But you are
here now
 
 
 
 
 
 
You are my love
 
 
There,
Thank you very much Shila Amzah.
 
Congratulations
because you sang it with the right pronunciation, diction and
 
 
and also the melody.
 
Very beautifully sang.
 
 
Thanks you once again.
And now,
 
I will play the video of the original singer of the song, Yeng Constantino
 
 
but I am not going to compare the 2 singers.
 
Just so you will be able to see and to know
that there is a singer in the Philippines named Yeng Constantino.
 
This is what's good about social media,
Your singers
and singers from different parts of the world like Malaysia
 
 
 
would be able to introduce to us Filipinos
 
and vice versa,
You would be able to know our singers and see them perform, too ok?
 
In a way, it's good
 
 
Just please don't be angry
like when your opinion doesn't run parallel with my opinion
or with the opinion of other fans.
 
Let's be civilized, ok?
Thank you very much
and watch and listen to the original
version of
 
Yeng Constantino
 
 
 
and you will notice that the version of Shila Amzah is so good
considering that
she's not Filipino. Ok?
So watch this guys.
 
 
I will leave you with video of Yeng Constantino playing the original version.
 
Happy watching
 
and thank you for watching.
Please don't forget to like, subscribe and share. Ok?
 
Thank you.
