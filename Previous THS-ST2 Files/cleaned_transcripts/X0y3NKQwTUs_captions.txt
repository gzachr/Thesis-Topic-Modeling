All right, I'm learning all right I'm not goodÂ 
at eating with my fingers so, don't judge me.
Herejean has officially talked me into eatingÂ 
some exotic food. Uh, super nervous about it um so
I don't know we were just chatting and I realizedÂ 
I really haven't tried too many exotic things!
So we figured now was the time! So we are headingÂ 
off to an international grocery store right now.
Right now is cold! Right now, this is our morningÂ 
time um it's about 6:30 p.m here.
It's not as bad as it's been it's like 50 degreesÂ 
right now. So yeah we're gonna go find some uhÂ ~Â 
We go to the we're gonna go to the Asian storeÂ 
and buy some exotic stuff so we don't know yetÂ Â 
what we're gonna find in there soÂ 
we're gonna bring you guys! Wish me luck.Â Â 
We are here at Saraga intern_tional grocery. HowÂ 
are you feeling Herejean? Ready to get exotic?Â Â 
I'll gonna buy more Asian food.
I know. ~ I'm a little nervous.
AndÂ we're deciding on what we want. 
I maybe should pick, so that way I can at leastÂ 
choose what I want. We're not getting exotic here.
I run the risk of eating like intestines orÂ 
something like that. I'll leave it up to her.
Yep Yep, that's about right. This is what I'mÂ 
going to eat. I'm going to have eyeballs.Â Â 
Anything interesting yet?
I don't knowÂ what is that. Herejean was super excited. ~ Yeah, already made.
With seasonings. And we love { Adobo }.
So it works out. So Herejean justÂ 
found some neck bone what is this one?
Pork liver....~ Uhhh! I don't want.
That is so weird. I will not eat that.
It's a full liver.
Huh?
What else we got?
Fresh pork uteri's. ~ Oh my god!
What is that? Fresh pork bunks. What is that?Â 
I don't know? How about this, pork tongue.Â Â 
Oh my ~ it makes my stomach, freak out! Pork heart, see this? Pork heart! I see it. It's terrifying.
Be gentle to me all right? Make sure give meÂ 
exotic but not too exotic. How about that?
Crazy stuff today.
Yehey! we're done! Half the battle. Knocked the food.
So this is all ~ Groceries.

Uh ~ We had small intestines. ~ Yeah! I think this isÂ 
beef intestine? Yeah, I think it's a beef intestineÂ Â 
so I cut it into small pieces so that IÂ 
can clean I'm really nervous about this.Â Â 
But it's safe because we used to eat thatÂ 
in the Philippines. And we have the rice thisÂ Â 
one is like um glutinous rice it's sweet riceÂ 
{ Okay } It's a Korean or Korean food but DominickÂ 
never tried it and me never tried it so giveÂ 
it a shot we got to try it. So we don't knowÂ Â

You just cut pieces of it? Yeah.~ Yeah?
Okay! I guess I'll start with the chicken neck. That's the most familiar.
Dominick don't know how to use his handÂ .
I use forks like a yeah but this is the rules.Â Â 
American all the same American. Huh? these are theÂ 
rules. No fork, no knife whatever just hands becauseÂ Â 
I'm doing a "mukbang" Yeah, I have to participateÂ 
fully. Okay! so this this is it huh you just biteÂ Â 
into it any rules I need to know? Nothing just eat.
There is a bone in here obviously. ~ Yeah.
Can you marry me now? 
I think I'm already tied in. Not so bad. Not so bad right? Regular chicken. ~ Yeah. All right!
I'm learning. All right I'm not good at eating withÂ 
my fingers so don't judge me.
How do you do it? 
Like that?
Yeah you look cute. ~  Do I?
I'm really not used to this. { no }Â 
For me, I don't like being a mess with my fingers 
and but we put some clean wrap under the tableÂ so this would be fine. I'm worried about my hands.Â Â 
Don't touch anything. When you eat like this.Â 
I'll use my hands and I'll do it American. ~ Okay.
Hope next time we can make another video likeÂ 
you know like chicken feet, neck, chicken gizzardÂ Â 
like that. We're gonna invite my little brotherÂ 
over yeah we're gonna do that with JoshuaÂ Â 
we're gonna have him try some exotic food.Â 
Shout out to Joshua or comment. ~ Yeah.
Chicken neck down. Dominick guys weird whenÂ 
every time he eats rice, he put soy sauce.Â 
I love it with soy sauce I don't I use it with aÂ 
fork though I don't know I don't want to dip myÂ Â 
fingers in soy sauce. It's okay!
Thanks. I'll probably doÂ it I'll probably stick to just a we share Baby! ~ Yeah? 
Everything I don't know how you doÂ 
it just straight. Do it again? Like this.
Let me see.
You just squeeze them. ButÂ they fall apart, No! you ~ You get this.Â Â 
Like plenty you know. Like that, youÂ 
squeeze them. You squeeze like this.Â Â 
Yeah and then, open your palm. OpenÂ ~
And then put it in your mouth.
It's a mess.
I'm gonna try a heart. I'm gonna try yourÂ 
try at the same time? You had oneÂ ?Â 
Not yet.
Never?
I cooked this for you! I don't knowÂ 
what to expect. For me? I don't want it. ~ All right. 
Okay. This is crazy chicken heart ~ Okay ready?
How is it? Reminds me of the chicken liver.Â 
Because that was my previous most exoticÂ Â 
thing I've had chicken liver. That's notÂ 
bad. That's not right? I can do that so howÂ ~Â 
How would you put soy sauce on yourÂ rice now?
Dip your finger. ~ Finger licking good Baby~ KFC. 
I don't got any elbow room.
Guy's Dominick, dipped his rice in the sauce and all his rice is already in the sauce. 
That's how is always ends up.
You want me to get you a spoon?
no it's okay i'm committed see themÂ 
fingers all messy i feel like grossÂ Â 
goods yeah every time you eat heartÂ 
you will remember like oh this is oneÂ Â 
life of chicken. You don't think the same thingÂ 
when reading it it's chicken wings and it's legs?
Just the heart. Oh now I've reallyÂ 
done it I mean his heart tried thisÂ beef ~
Oh shoot! Small intestine. Okay nowÂ 
this one seems the grossest to me.
You trust me right? I cleaned that. Of course IÂ will not feed you if that is not clean I know okay.
Isn't this like street food in the Philippines? ~ Yeah.
How is it?
Extremely good!
See? Just trust me. ~ I think its just in my head. ~ Yeah because. I know that. Because guys ~
Because earlier when it's still uncooked Dominick saw theÂ real ~
The uncooked version all I got to say yeah 
The uncooked version so he feels gross but of courseÂ I clean it. Yeah? So that's not poop right there
I'm gonna pretend none of it's poop.Â 
Let's just keep eating yeah tastes good.
What the chicken poop? It's just what? Feeds. IÂ don't either way it's poop I don't want it.
But! Unfortunately this is the tastiestÂ 
part so far. Did you cook it differently?
I put some ketchup and soy sauce. That'sÂ 
why, you're helping me out. So that he will not taste.
Tastes good. ~ Tastes good?
I expected to throw up on that one so I've comeÂ a long way. I deserve like a reward for this.
{ Bravery } Among three which one you like so far?
The actual taste wise? The intestines but you alsoÂ put soy sauce on there yeah so I don't know likeÂ Â 
the natural taste of it I suppose. Yeah for me thatÂ 
small intestine too and then the chicken neck.
The last one is the heart. I don't know if I'm gonnaÂ 
try the blood that's pretty extreme I tried it.
I know you tried it. That's a little extreme forÂ 
me. Just try to taste like a penny does it tasteÂ Â 
like just metal? No it's not try just small piece.
I don't know let me stick to the essentials first.
So guys this is the ~ What is this thing again? Glutinous ~Â Is it Korean? Yeah! it's the glutinous or
Malagkit rice and then inside guys it looksÂ 
like complete meal. Like there is a shrimps,
mushroom ~ Really? Yeah! but it's good I feel likeÂ 
this is good with together with the coffee.
With coffee? That's not what I expected.Â 
Let's find out here.
Because I like coffee.
Yeah ~ See this guy's!
With everything. It's good!Â 
This looks the most normalÂ so ~
There's shrimp in here? Hmm!
Say the name for me one more time. ~ Which one?
The name of what this called. I don't know the name.
It's Korean. Oh it's nice because it just takes aÂ good see that? Yeah. I can eat this in any direction.
Why mine is not like that?
Definitely very good but never eat this coffee.Â 
Never eat? With coffee? No this is not as bad as
I thought. So when you go to Philippines we'reÂ 
gonna ~ See I'm willing to try things so when
I do go to Philippines, You will not die? ThisÂ 
is like prep for me to go? Yeah! well prepared.
Cheers!
