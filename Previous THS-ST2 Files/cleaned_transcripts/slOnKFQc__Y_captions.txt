- Ladies, gentlemen, people
from all over the world,
welcome to paradise.
This is Coron in the Philippines,
and it is absolutely one of
the most incredible places
to go in the country.
We're on a boat now, we rented it
to go a little bit early here on a Monday.
It's 7:00 a.m., we are
almost at Kayangan Lagoon,
we're gonna see Twin Lakes
as well, Skeleton Wreck
and a whole bunch more.
This is an alternate version
of one of the most popular
activities here on the island.
Let's do it.
(uplifting electronic music)
Little behind-the-scenes.
We are now in one of the two Twin Lagoons.
To get to the second one,
you have to jump in the
water, swim to the ladder
and go up to the top.
This one looks really nice,
but we'd like to get this
camera through the water
up to the second lagoon.
I have this underwater
housing on my camera.
I have this Pelican
Case that's waterproof.
We're gonna fill it with camera gear
and go for a swim.
Let's bring it to the second lagoon.
(uplifting electronic music)
Alright, adventure update.
Crew.
(laughing)
The boat doesn't go all the
way to the second Twin Lagoon.
We can get to one Twin Lagoon,
we can't to two with all
the camera equipment.
So we've got our camera equipment.
- [Cody] Dude, I'm so
amazed that that floats.
- It's a Pelican Case.
- Yes.
- Which is now my life preserver,
'cause life preservers are required,
and we're headed to lagoon two.
- [Cody] Let's go.
(uplifting electronic music)
(bright electronic music)
(water gushing)
- [Mike] We've got mangoes,
we've got chicken adobo,
we've got bananas, we've
got rice, we've got Cody.
- Hey.
- We've got Jette.
- Hey.
(laughing)
- We are just going to eat a quick lunch
before going to Calcala.
(laughs) What was it?
(beeping)
- [Cody] Calabasas.
- Calabasas.
We are just eating a quick lunch
before we got to Calabayan.
(laughing)
(beeping)
What is it?
- Kayangan.
- Kayangan Lake (laughs).
We're eating lunch here,
because the hot tip of today is
people go eat lunch somewhere else.
So if you come here,
have lunch at Calabayan.
- Kayangan.
- Kayangan.
- (laughs) Kayangan Lake.
I'll get it right one of these times.
- Kayangan Lake.
- Kayangan Lake.
- [Man] Yeah.
- In Philippines, this is how we do it.
(plastic clattering)
We use our fingers.
It's like I'm becoming Filipino,
but I think that name's already taken.
Filipino, Filipina friends,
how do I do this?
The rice is complicated.
I do a little pincer, like crab claw,
and then I whoop it off
and in my mouth.
Is that how it works?
- We are now about to climb
up these stairs, here
in Kayangan Lake Trail.
We gotta pay just a small
little fee right now to go up.
We do have to wear a life jacket.
- Small fee, it's 900 for three people.
(cash register dinging)
- A small fee.
- Medium fee.
- A medium-size fee,
and we do have to wear these life jackets,
so I'm not just wearing this
for fun, just so you know,
or to look cool.
We're about to hike up
this trail right here.
You ready?
- I'm wearing my life jacket.
- [Cody] So you're ready.
- Alright, crew, Kayangan Lake,
during a not-so busy time.
Still pretty busy.
(insects chirping)
(uplifting electronic music)
- I feel like this is not very comfy.
Not very sexy at all (laughs).
- [Cody] Mike, you could've died.
- Yeah, oh my god.
- Alright, so, real talk for a second.
We just got to Cangayan, Kayga.
(beeping)
Kayangan.
- [Man] Kayangan.
- Kayangan.
They're making you wear a life jacket.
There's no way around life jacket thing.
For me, adventure travel,
it's not about life jackets,
but I understand it's about being safe.
So we're here at the lake
and we're going to follow the rules,
but if you want to have
a bit more adventure
when you're here in a life jacket,
we've found a special way
you can enjoy yourself.
It's gonna be called
Underwater Rock Climbing.
You saw it here first,
the new extreme sport.
Here we go.
(water splashing)
(intense electronic music)
(insects chirping)
(water splashing)
- [Cody] What is he doing?
(intense electronic music)
(water splashing)
(laughing)
I don't get it, how is that a loophole?
- It's like underwater rock climbing!
I wasn't kicking, I was pulling.
- [Cody] Oh, I see, okay.
(laughing)
(water splashing)
- Coolness ruined.
- Yeah, that was cool.
(laughing)
Alright, so I bet this is
pretty cool-looking, this.
(laughing)
(grunting)
We are about to go in
this cave right here,
that we found in Kayangan Lake,
and we don't have a torch or anything,
so I don't know how well
this is gonna turn out,
but we'll find out.
Show us how it's done, Jetta.
(water splashing)
Oh, alright.
- [Jette] I know why no one gets in here.
- Alright.
It's actually not that dark for the GoPro,
so this is pretty cool.
- [Jette] You can't get that
into the proper dark spot over there.
- Oh, I see.
(suspenseful music)
Feel like Mike is underneath somewhere.
- [Jette] I don't know,
I think that John thinks that he won't.
(suspenseful music)
- Hello.
- [Cody] This is pretty cool, actually.
- Yeah.
- [Cody] Here, Mike,
I'll pass you the torch.
(water gushing)
(insects chirping)
Magic Mike, right here.
- [Jette] You can see now wide?
I'm surfing.
- You're gonna make it
look fabulous.
- [Jette] I better look
fabulous after this.
- [Mike] What's goin' on, Cody?
- I just want love.
(laughing)
- We found this really awesome spot
to get photos of the viewpoint,
but the problem is, it kinda looks
like you're creeping from a cave,
looking at people hanging
out at the viewpoint.
It's pretty funny (laughs).
But the view up there, though.
Get back in the dark.
(chilled electronic music)
Pretty epic entrance to a lagoon.
(chilled electronic music)
Alright, Luluyuwan is also
known as Barracuda Lake,
because there apparently
are barracudas inside,
but that's not the reason we're here.
It's a great swimming lake
and they let you fly a
drone, which is also a bonus,
but this particular lake
is extremely special
for scuba divers.
At between 14 and 20 meters,
there is a layer of 40 degrees
Celsius hot salt water,
and the top is perfectly fresh,
it's like body temperature,
and below that again is
more freezing cold water.
So, if you dive down,
you can hit that layer
at between 14 and 20 meters,
and it is like a hot tub, 40 Celsius.
We don't have scuba gear
today, unfortunately,
but I do have fins, so we
are going to try to free-dive
down that deep to find the hot layer.
Alright, so here we are.
Down there, we should be
able to find a halo climb,
which is where the hot salty water sits,
at about 18 meters or something,
and above that is the fresh water.
We'll know we hit it,
because all of a sudden
it'll look like the camera's out of focus,
it'll look like my eyes are out of focus.
It's because the swirling
of the two waters
makes almost like an iridescent
foggy, shimmering layer.
I'm hoping, hoping we can see that today.
I'm also hoping I can dive down
deep enough to be able to see it.
It's super deep.
(motivational electronic music)
We can get a free manicure.
- Can you?
- You can get a free
shrimp manicure (laughs).
- Things I've always wanted in my life.
- Ooh, that was a good day.
We're just wrapping it up.
I went back to get a couple more shots
of one of the lagoons, and--
- [Man] Oh my god.
- It's like bumper boats, man (laughs).
- Yeah.
- We're trying to get out.
Also trying to find my friends,
because they were waiting for me
and they took the kayak out.
We rented a kayak today.
We didn't really use it because
a lot of places you can't,
you have to hike into the actual island
before you get on
and in the lagoon.
So they took out the kayak
for one quick little spin,
and I don't know where they are.
- [Man] They're going right there.
- They're over there.
- Yeah.
- That was a good day, man.
This is a beautiful spot.
Beautiful place.
Guys, I have found a Pokemon, I think.
Squalab, they were slip,
no, slipper lobsters.
They're called slipper lobsters,
and they don't have the claws.
Can I pick it up?
May I touch it?
- Yes.
- It's sharp, eh?
How do I pick it up?
The back, okay.
Look at this thing.
It's like a mitten with claws.
And you eat, yeah?
For food?
It's like an alien face-sucker.
Ah.
I shall name you Slippy
and I will take you back to Canada.
What do you guys think, cute or not,
and would you pick this thing up or not?
That was a fantastic day
exploring around Coron in the Philippines.
I want to say goodbye
to our friend, Jette,
who was a model today.
- Bye!
- And also, our model,
Cody Buffinton.
- Goodbye!
- Exploring with Cody.
We had an awesome day today,
we saw some incredible things
and if you haven't checked
out Cody's channel,
you've got to make sure to do that.
