- What's up guys?
We are in the Philippines.
And we're here to find all of the
exclusive items that are
only in the Philippines
at all the fast food places.
- And today we're going to JP's favorite
where he can get the one sandwich
that he's obsessed with.
- [JP] Oh they have a Baconator?
- (gasp)
I don't know if they have a
Baconator on the menu or not,
but we are heading to Wendy's
and I actually see it right here.
It's the same logo.
So why don't we go check out the menu
and see what we're missing.
- [JP] I think the sad thing is,
is that we don't get to try the things
that we love.
We have to try something different.
- It's good to try something new.
- All right Jules, be careful.
Oh here we go.
Let's just go.
Let's just go.
- [Julia] Wendy's soon
will be in your mouth.
- [JP] Yeah, oh wow okay yeah.
Yup, Wendy's you know, we'll die for it.
That's how much we like it.
- [Julia] Oh look it. They
even have a little cart.
- [JP] Wow, we can just order it.
Why don't we just do that?
Wow.
- [Julia] Oh it's so
nicely air conditioned.
- [JP] Oh!
- [Julia] I love the AC.
- [JP] What are you going to get here?
- I'm going to get whatever
you want me to get.
- [JP] We got rice meals, chicken..
This is like KFC.
They oh.. They have my Baconator.
Can I please get one?
- [Julia] No.
- [JP] Mango Marble Frosty Top.
With popping mango boba.
- [Julia] Bacon taco melt!
I don't know how I missed that.
That's the major thing that's the coolest,
awesome, most craziest different thing.
(upbeat music)
- [Julia] What?
Foreal?
- [JP] Yeah.
Wow.
Holy cow.
I don't think I waited
more than like two minutes.
And we're back!
- This is our Airbnb, welcome.
- Item number one.
- I have no idea what's in that box.
- I don't either, but it's cute.
(gasp)
I can't see it.
Tilt it.
- [Julia] Oh.
Wow, we're starting with
the buffalo chicken.
- [JP] Is this KFC?
It literally comes with
like a biscuit and chicken?
- No, they're like little bites.
Is that a biscuit?
I don't know what's in here.
- [JP] What is it?
- I think it's rice in a little package.
- [JP] Oh wow, they put
rice in a little package?
- I could tell by the texture
when I squeezed it.
- [JP] It's like onigiri.
- It's a good way to eat rice.
Like a burger.
- [JP] The Filipinos love their rice.
That's one thing we learned.
- [Julia] All right, I think
this is the buffalo sauce.
It's not that regular like
Frank's hot sauce buffalo.
This is like a delicious...
Oh, Wendy's!
Bring this to my house.
It's the first thing.
Hot sauce with little nuggets.
Delicious!
- Ooh, I love this little
pillow of rice packet.
- [Julia] I don't know if
that's how they eat it.
- Is it spicy?
- Yeah, but it's good
spicy, like (coughs).
I like it a lot.
What is it?
Okay, I'm doing it.
- Anticipation is killing me.
Is it more rice?
(gasps)
- I think it's the Salisbury steak.
- Salisbury steak.
It looks like a beef patty.
Sorry Wendy, I don't know if this one
is going to hit home for me
and I'm pretty sure we need
a fork or a knife for this.
I don't know if this is Salisbury steak
or if this is just a burger patty.
- [JP] It's a burger patty,
but you put the mushroom stuff on top.
You build it yourself.
- There's a mushroom in there.
Come out.
- [JP] I love this rice by the way.
It's super sticky and amazing.
- [Julia] It is really good.
- Yeah, mhmm.
Swanson, take notes.
My mom's gotta take notes too.
- [Julia] Is that a knife?
- [JP] Yeah.
- [Julia] You found a knife...
that looks like a knife.
You found one!
- I did except it's the backend of a fork.
- [Julia] Oh.
- [JP] You gotta do it right.
Do a little bit of rice,
little bit of steak.
I'm going for the bite.
This is so strange.
This is at a Wendy's.
I don't know how to feel.
- [Julia] You like it?
- Yeah.
- No.
I'm sorry.
- Not even a little bit though?
Not even like the tiniest
bit of you likes it?
- Part of me likes the sauce.
It's the beef.
I like ground beef on a
burger when it's medium rare.
Taste the meat solo-dolo.
Does the meat taste the same without
the Salisbury sauce on it?
- It definitely tastes different.
It definitely tastes different.
The chicken at the KFC didn't taste
like the chicken in the U.S. either.
- [Julia] No, it didn't.
- Video's right there.
The Philippines, they got their own style.
(gasps)
The same.
It's like happy duck day.
(gasps)
Oh!
- It's another box.
- I like the packaging.
- [Julia] I'm gonna get
some good b-roll right now
so hold tight.
Opening it like JP is with me.
- [JP] Let me see.
Oh yes.
- [Julia] Yes!
- [JP] We've already tried spaghetti.
If you haven't seen that
video, it's right here.
All right, mix it around with your fork.
Let me see some action here.
Some meat action.
Where's that hot dog?
- [Julia] Oh you want to see that dog?
They cut them up.
Almost cubed-like.
And you see they put
definitely enough sauce.
Sometimes I see the sauce on these things
kind of being kind of light.
Oh it's all mixed together.
It's beautiful.
Don't show them this video.
- [JP] I'm sorry.
You know that sweet and sour that you dip
your chicken in at the Chinese restaurant?
- [Julia] Yeah.
- [JP] They just add that
to the spaghetti sauce.
- You're making that up.
I don't want my round hot dogs
so I can grab it easier with my fork.
I really like the KFC
version a little bit better.
- Yeah, I'm not gonna lie.
I think KFC wins on the spaghetti so far.
- Oh!
- [JP] We have a second quest
videos of the Philippines
and that is which place
has the best spaghetti?
So we have to order spaghetti
at every place that offers it.
- [Julia] Absolutely.
- Surprise.
- Oh, surprise.
(gasps)
Spring rolls!
- [JP] Spring rolls at a Wendy's?
Wendy just happens to be on the box.
That is the only thing
correlating my brain
to Wendy's right now.
- I opened it really easy that time.
Did you see that?
- [JP] They already are
winning on the fact that
their sauce packets are
easy to open you know?
Yeah, go in for it.
It sounds good.
- Yum!
Oh, these are good.
Did they put the Wendy's
beef inside that spring roll?
- They put the Wendy's
beef in the spring roll?
- I think so.
- Okay, maybe we should like
dissect this little bit.
- I'm eating this.
- Oh my goodness.
- [Julia] You put your
beef in a spring roll.
It's for real.
It's in there.
- I love it.
- Right?
- Mhmm.
- I'm so surprised.
- I'm done now.
Are you number one, spring roll?
- [Julia] We don't know what to think.
- You're like so many like
conflicting nationalities.
(fast beat music)
- [Julia] I'm scared.
- [JP] What is it?
- [Julia] Chicken!
- [JP] Oh, this is the special thing!
(dramatic piano playing)
Oh yeah, slow turn.
Slow turn.
Yeah.
Oh look at the little nub on the side.
Oh, oh yes.
All right, I can't look at it anymore.
- You know what this smells like?
KFC.
- [JP] Did Wendy's borrow that from KFC?
Did you just lick this?
- It's mine.
- [JP] Fried chicken in the Philippines
needs to be accompanied with gravy.
- [Julia] Wow, they have so many things.
- [JP] Corn chowder.
Grab that spoon.
- [Julia] Are you sure this is soup?
- [JP] Yes.
- [Julia] Yum.
- [JP] You know what it reminds me of?
That street food we had earlier today.
Except it had rice.
- Glutinous rice.
- [JP] ...and intestines.
- All right, you eat that, I eat this.
Mmm!
What?
- I don't know.
I don't...this...
- This is from a Wendy?
Oh my god!
- Why does this taste like pudding?
I don't think you're going
to like it at all so try it.
- I don't like corn.
It taste like vanilla
pudding with corn in it.
- Yeah, it's like vanilla in it.
I'm like what?
- It taste like vanilla
pudding with corn in it.
It's not bad, it's just different.
- This is better than KFC.
- Give me.
Taste that gravy.
- Dude, that's good.
- Doesn't this gravy taste like KFC kinda?
- I think the Philippines
invented KFC gravy
because it's literally the
best gravy on this planet.
- Yum!
This is going to be one of the most
different things we've ever had.
Okay, it looks like we
got cheese, cucumber,
green jello, red jello and pineapple.
I'm a little afraid of this one.
I'm sorry guys.
I don't want to offend anybody.
I didn't even notice that!
I guess we have to do
what the Filipinos do.
- [JP] We don't even know what they do.
They probably don't even order this.
They're probably like,
"Why'd you get that?"
- [Julia] Seems like this is added on.
We gotta put it all on right?
Yes.
I'm gonna taste this.
- Jello and Russian dressing.
I mean, I can't think
of a better combination.
- I think the whole point of this salad
is that is is like a halo halo
where you have all the things
and each bite is supposed to
be a little bit different.
- That's good.
It's good mac salad.
The jello's a little different.
- Unfortunately, it scares me
because of all like the green and red.
- [JP] It kind of reminds me of
like a Christmas fruit cake.
Red jello, I think cherry.
Green jello, I think lime.
- Me too.
- Neither have any flavor.
(upbeat music)
Next item.
Not a red box.
You know Wendy's is iconic
for their baked potato,
but did you know they have
this type of baked potato?
- Wow, look how they
served their potatoes.
It's like flattened out.
- [JP] It's like a mashed
potato baked potato.
It's a thriced baked potato.
- [Julia] They really do.
They cut it up so it's easier
to eat on the go maybe?
I don't know.
- We didn't see chili though.
- No, no chili.
So what are they doing
with the extra meat?
Putting it in spring rolls?
- This isn't for the faint of heart.
If you don't like mushrooms,
you will not like this.
It is wafting with mushroom flavor.
- I am not a faint of heart,
but thank you for asking.
- It's okay.
This looks pretty cool.
This almost looks like a filet-o-fish.
- [Julia] Sauce, cucumber,
lettuce and shrimp patty.
- [JP] Yeah.
- I have to say, cucumber on
a sandwich is a great idea.
It's actually really freakin' good.
It's delicious.
I like it better than shrimp.
- Yeah, it's not bad.
- It's better than a fish filet.
Sorry McDonalds.
- This shrimp burger works.
Shrimpy, bready, flakey, tender-y.
Yay, I'm happy.
- Yay.
- My favorite's gonna be the last.
- Is this a coincidence
or did you plan for that?
- I totally planned it.
We have yet to eat a single burger.
Salisbury steak does not count.
(arguing back and forth)
- It does.
- Burger.
- Yes it does.
(laughing)
- [JP] Expectations.
Reality.
They put Doritos on it?
- [Julia] Almost like a
pico de gallo type thing
and then yeah, there's
some type of sauce on here.
- My expectations were higher
than what this actually is.
I mean, the meat's really good.
It's Wendy's meat.
The cheese on it is really good
and this sauce...
I like it.
Does that look like a square to you?
Looks kind of round.
- I'm gonna sit here.
- [JP] You gotta finish that though.
You gotta try that.
- No, I don't want to eat it.
- [JP] Okay, you don't have to.
- You can't make me.
You described it so grossly.
- [JP] Yeah, I wasn't a fan.
- Okay, I'll have a quick bite.
Okay.
- Julia was like not about this.
Now she is about this.
- No, I'm not about it.
- I'm so confused.
- I just feel like if I don't try it,
then JP is gonna make
fun of me for 17 days
like he did about the Pizza Hut video.
Anyways.
- Eat it.
It's a little yeah.
- I really like chicken.
I'm a chicken lover.
I love fried chicken.
I have fried chicken all
day, errday, I love chicken.
- [JP] Yeah, my top pick hands down
is gonna be that drumstick.
- Yeah.
- Literally like the best drumstick.
- It's the chicken.
It's delicious.
