nice vegetables here um

hesitate to let me know
looking forward to your comments okay so
it's a simple recipe guys and i heated
up some oil
and now i'm gonna add the bawang
also going to add in the onions
so give the bawang and sibuyas a nice
color and then we will add
uh some chicken thighs so will you
use chicken breast normally for chop
suey
i think so but today i only have uh
chicken thighs
but anyway these are very tasty so let's
put them in
it's becoming a little bit chilly guys
here in the netherlands

halo halo
so i will wait for the sun so let's add
in the other vegetables okay
let's mix them a bit it looks beautiful
and it smells great
so i'm not going to overcook the
vegetables
keep a little bit of light so i have
some
water with corn starch here hot water
mix it
okay so i'm also gonna add one cube of
chicken stock
give it some saltiness and a little bit
