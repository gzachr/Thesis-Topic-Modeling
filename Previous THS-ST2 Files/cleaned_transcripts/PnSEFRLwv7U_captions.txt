Nestled on Mactan Island in the Philippines
The Crimson Resort & Spa Mactan
Is nothing short of a stunning hotel,
With service and facilities to match.
The villas are filled with character and
Beautiful decorations,
In the whole place is an oasis of tranquility.
Wandering around this village-like hotel is a real
Pleasure, one can instantly feel touched by
The warmth of the friendly staff.
And because the whole property is trendy,
You can stay there with friends for fun
Or a lover for some romance.
The attention to detail continues
Through the dining facilities, where I
was tempted to order everything off the menu.
And if you prefer to kick back and
Enjoy the hotel for the day,
You can relax on a comfortable sunbed at the
Pool lounge in a trendy atmosphere,
Preferably with a cocktail in hand.
If you are looking for romantic, casual
But over-the-top luxury, with all the bits and pieces
Of the best in Southeast Asia,
This is without a doubt your best bet,
You will not be disappointed.
Here one finds unparalleled comfort and service
In romantic and select surroundings,
where all our desires are
Being addressed in beauty and excellence.
The Crimson Resort & Spa Mactan
Is the perfect getaway in Cebu.
