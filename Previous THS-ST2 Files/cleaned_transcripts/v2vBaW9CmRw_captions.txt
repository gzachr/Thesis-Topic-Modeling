Hi There!
Will start the Moby first
since it's infront of us
Don't finish it cos that's my favourite
smells really chocolatey
I'm sure it's really healthy for you
It's not
Would be full of sugar
Not very chocolatey but
It is crunchy, it's okay
It's okay
Taste like chips
It's typical sour cream and onion
I'll tell you they're very close to a pringle
It is really good
It's yum
I prefer that than the Moby
Yeah, It is real filipino words that is
I feel like I'm saying pure Tagalog or Bisaya here
Very Sweet
Really really sweet and not very chessy
I'm not a big fan on that one
Nah, It's a bit sweet
Now you're telling me
mmm savory
and it's not as sweet
It's okay
It's like a
It's taste like a corn chip
It's alright
It's savory not sweet which is good
Another very very Filipino word
Taste like sweetcorn
Absolutely no corn in here at all
Flavour, sweetcorn
It does have corn
also coconut oil, vegetable oil, corn flavour, salt, sugar
lots of really healthy things
like artificial food colour
soy
but that's not so bad
I prefer real sweetcorn
Well I guess it's a RI cos it's made from rice
and it's milk flavoured
Oh it's really sweet
hmm not too sweet but milk flavoured
Why would you have something milk flavoured?
It's nice, It's okay, it's a lil bit tasteless
It's alright, It's okay
This is something probably a bit more flavour, prawn crackers
Let's taste this one
spicy flavour, oh the spice is there
it's nice
taste like prawns
yeah taste like prawn flavour so that's right
smells like seafood
Just weird eating a cracker
that meant to taste like seafood
Which is basically fake pork
we got fake corn
we got fake chocolate
salt & vinegar flavoured
and I like salt & vinegar
so I would say for me, my favourite two
of the snacks we just tried
could be these two
This would be the winners for me
These two
Yeah these would be the winners for me
Out of the 8 we tried, these would be my two favourites
We hope no bashers
I hope you enjoy this video
