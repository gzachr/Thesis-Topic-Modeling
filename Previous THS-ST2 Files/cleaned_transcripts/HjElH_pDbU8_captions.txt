(electronic music)
My friends, I'm in Fuente right now,
but this actually feels
like the Times Square
of the Philippines.
I don't know, I've never
been to Times Square,
but everything's lit up,
there's lights everywhere.
One giant, big roundabout
and lots of places to eat out
and shopping malls and these
jitneys here behind me.
I don't know, the Times
Square of the Philippines?
I don't know, but there's
plenty of lights around here.
Everything's lit up.
Energy's great.
I just rocked up here, it's 20 to 9:00.
Day one of the Philippines.
(upbeat electronic music)
All right my friends, it is
quarter to 10:00 at
night, my first day here
in the Philippines.
I'm in Fuente, which
is what I like to call
the New York of the Philippines.
New York, not New York.
Times Square of the Philippines, actually.
I don't even know if I can verify that
because I've never been to Times Square.
Anyway, just real quick,
I walked around this place
for about an hour or
so with the Jollibees.
If you've never had
there before, do try it.
It's big in the Philippines.
I only tried it because quite a few people
made mention in the comments
that I should go and try it next time,
so I tried it.
Anyway, so lots of places
to eat here.
There are fast food places here.
There's McDonald's and KFC,
Jollibees, blah blah blah,
and there's Robinson's,
big shopping centre here.
Closes at 9:00 p.m., so
I couldn't walk in there,
but just a shopping centre.
And then also a bunch of bars
and things like that around here as well.
And I'll flash it up on your screen,
all the locations of all the bars here.
Which I never got a chance to go into
'cause I'm actually
tired, I wanna go to bed.
I need to get up at 4:00
a.m. tomorrow morning,
but I'll flash it up on your screen.
This is where all the bars are
in this area, so if you're
doing an overnight here,
I speak to the American
audience now watching this,
if you're doing an overnight
here in Cebu Mountain,
or the city of Cebu,
then you could come
out here for one night,
come see the bars, come walk
around the big roundabout here,
check out the lights,
be part of the energy.
It's quite nice.
And if you know me well,
you watch the videos,
you know I like energy wherever I go,
so that's it from me.
I'm gonna sign off for this video.
I hope you enjoyed it,
and speaking seriously tomorrow,
scuba diving tomorrow, don't miss it.
