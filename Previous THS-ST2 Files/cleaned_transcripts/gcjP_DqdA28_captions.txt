I literally just woke up
OK so BTS dropped another teaser
ibighit (mumbling),
I can't even talk right now
Bighit entertainment just dropped
something new called
Not Today
I was knocked out,
I was freshly knocked out
and all of a sudden this was dropped
But it's OK because I actually wanna
know more of what's going to happen.
Oh it's only 33 seconds,
I thought it was gonna be like a minute
Oh damn, 
oh so it's one of these short ones.
It's nice that they gave us another teaser
This is called
Not Today
Let's go, Not Today.
(ibighit intro SFX)
(bing)
Aaw, I messed up.
OK, I like them shoes though.
Y'all running?
Ooo, this shit look gonna be look, 
it's gonna look epic.

No no, not February 20.
Yeah Febraury 20.
Let's play that one more time.
Imma get you this time.
(bing) (JRE does a mediocre job)
Let's see, let's see.
So they're running from somebody,
people in like black outfits
like, like some Illuminatifweljd
(blatantly mispronounces)
You know what I'm talking about.
The music though,
aw it's gonna sound epic if that's
how it's gonna have in the actual 
Not Today song.
If, is this gonna be called Not Today? 
Cause,
Not Today
Cause we already know,
Not Today
Not Today,
not right now.
Was this even warned or just 
came out of nowhere?
Not Today
In the last one, I, OK,
it's about Omelas.
Omelas is a book, right.
That's what everbody's going towards
about Omelas.
It literally says Omelas on the damn
hotel, um, where they're staying at.
I actually wanna read more about it.
I dunno if I read that in high school,
I think I did.
I'm also not a big reader but
I definitely wanna read Omelas now.
God damn, God damnit BT-
