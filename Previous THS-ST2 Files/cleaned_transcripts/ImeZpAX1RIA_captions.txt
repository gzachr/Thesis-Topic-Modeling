i'm gonna make an amazing filipino food and i will 
use it as a filling for dumplings with this recipe  
i will use the deep fryer let's put in some oil we 
need about 2.5 liters of oil because we're gonna  
deep fry some pork i always like to try being 
creative you know with filipino dishes it's nice  
to combine them with other foods diba? so i want 
to make a nice pork sisig and put it as a filling  
you know so it's an amazing pinoy dish but we will 
use it in a gyoza or dumpling let's turn it on at
175 degrees celsius as you might have noticed i'm 
doing it on the floor today we're on the ground  
it's a bit it's like a filipino style no it's 
always nice you know if you are in the nature  
especially in the philippines 
of course if you cook outdoors  
it's like you're feeling one with the nature 
no the the oil is getting hot we're gonna deep  
fry some pork i have some nice pork here 
okay so we're gonna try and fry to make it  
really crispy i'm gonna add one slice of pork 
for trial just to see how it goes there we go
i think the oil is hot enough see it's already 
frying i think i can add two at one time  
sayang diba let me add one more goes a bit faster
now it's super mainit no super init i really 
hope that filipino food becomes well known  
in the netherlands and of course 
also in other countries in europe  
of course you can also help by giving 
a thumbs up if you like this video  
please give it a thumbs up you may also share it 
with your friends and family of course if you like
look at that
look at how ganda these flowers are they're 
really beautiful no i think these are hibiscus  
but i love this color let 
me know if you like flowers
i think you call this lechon kawali  
so what we will do i'm going to chop it 
really fine a bit more fine than usual
it's getting really fine
i think this should be all right i will 
put the pork aside and i'm gonna chop  
some sibuyas i'll use the same chopping 
board because i'm gonna mix the sibuyas  
anyway so i use a white onion and red 
onion okay let's also chop this really fine  
this would be an amazing dish to share 
with your friends and family you know  
so my challenge for you please try 
to also make this recipe at home  
and share it with your friends and family okay so 
you can watch the video and i will also put the  
procedures in the description now the fun part i'm 
heating up this pen i have some butter here okay  
you can use butter or margarine i guess 
so we'll add a little bit of butter
so first i will refry this pork i'm not sure 
if you do the same way but i like it like this
so the pork is really crispy so 
now i will add half of the onions  
okay half of the sibuyas goes in
let's mix it a little bit
i turn the heat a little bit lower i'll add 
a little bit of black pepper okay so paminta
as well as some garlic powder okay just my 
own idea to add a little bit of garlic powder
i've been told that these uh cds are sobrang 
anghang so i'm gonna add still i'm gonna add  
three of them because i like sisig has to be spicy 
you know so let's chop up the chilies a little bit
tiny pieces i really wish 
you could smell this dish  
that smells so amazing i guess my 
neighbors are getting gutom as well
it's time to add konting lime juice or calamansi
a little bit of toyo this is 
a toyo with calamansi also
and some mayonnaise
so let's mix this all together and then we 
will add our final part of the sibuyas so  
i will turn the heat off okay and then 
i'll add the remaining part of the sibuyas
and then it's pretty much 
done for the sisig pork sisig
now the video is about an amazing filipino 
filling right filipino food for a dumpling  
like i said dumpling or gyoza so we have 
some gyoza skins here these are homemade  
these are really good quality gyoza skins but 
you can use also the frozen type if you have  
this is my own invention and the first 
time i'm making this i hope it will  
turn out good guys i take a little bit of the 
filling put it on the gyoza skin okay not too much  
maybe this is already a little bit too much i'm 
gonna try first put a little bit of water on the  
okay just for half part like this and then we're 
gonna fold it okay to close the gyoza or dumpling  
with the sisig filling just carefully press  
next thing we're gonna do is 
fold the skin like this okay
just like this it requires a little 
bit of practice but once you tried it  
it's very easy i'm sure you can do 
it just fold it a little bit okay  
like that so let's try another one i'll 
use a little bit less filling this time  
get a little bit of everything and then repeat 
as we did before and those are our gyoza see  
what do you think this would be so nice 
to combine with the filipino ramen did  
you see my filipino ramen before i'll put 
the link here okay you can watch the video  
so we'll put them in a 
little bit of oil not too hot
you can coat them in the oil a little bit and 
then carefully flip them around and then what  
you can do if they're not done yet you can cover 
them cover them so that the skin will also cook
these dumplings will be so delicious
these are so set up a little bit  
very tasty looking forward to your comments 
i hope you try this please let me know how it  
goes thanks a lot for watching maraming salamat 
po see you next time with more filipino food!
