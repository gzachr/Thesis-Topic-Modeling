-You know, my mom was also
a Type A personality,
so even though I know
she would like help,
if we didn't make these right,
she'd be pissed.
You know, she'd be like,
"What are you doing?"
♪♪
What's up, guys?
Dale Talde here,
the chef founder
of Food Crush Hospitality,
and I'm here to make you
Eva Talde's,
who's my mother, Pancit Molo
which is basically wonton soup.
Pancit Molo,
it's like two things, right?
It's wontons and this
beautiful broth.
My mother's wontons are shrimp,
chicken and pork.
I did this almost
every holiday season,
and it is our family's kind of
one of our favorite things
to have during Thanksgiving
and Christmas.
So we're peeling the shrimp,
and we are saving the shells.
These shells are going
to help fortify the broth,
and this is really
an important part
because this broth
really is what,
you know,
holds the soup together,
and it has to have that
really kind of briny,
oceanic flavor to it.
I have no real fancy way
to clean shrimp.
I split them open first.
This is where I go and kind of
get rid of the inside piece.
-Yeah, the old poop vein,
right.
Going to take these to the sink
and give those
a little bit of wash.
We're going to trim these up
just a bit,
so these need to go in with some
ground chicken and ground pork.
Lobster works really well.
What you're looking for is that
really beautiful bouncy texture,
so while you can use crab,
there has to be a little bit
of shrimp in this
to give it that beautiful
texture that you're looking for.
Just give it...
give this a bit of a whack
to almost make a paste, right.
You want this to be something
that glues,
kind of fuses
everything together.
Give this a bit of a rough chop
just to kind of make sure
everything nice and combined.
You know, I worked at
a Cantonese restaurant
in the city,
and the dim sum team would,
when they were making
these types of fillings,
there would always be one person
who with a giant bowl
would be grabbing things and
kind of smashing it together.
We always called it
the whack fuck.
Like, here comes the whack fuck,
and he would do it for,
like, 30 minutes.
So now that we've minced our
shrimp and prepared our shrimp,
we are ready to assemble
the filling for our wontons.
We're going to go with pork,
so we're going
to use chicken here.
We're going to chop up
our garlic chives.
These have a really
pronounced flavor of garlic.
This is great, but this is
what's going to give
that distinct flavor
to the wonton.
They have to be cooked
a little bit.
Eating these raw
I don't suggest.
They're not great.
Like, you know how you can
eat scallions raw?
These aren't fantastic,
but these definitely have
a fantastic flavor,
a fantastic aroma.
So to this, we're going to add
a touch of soy,
little bit of oyster sauce.
Then this is where I deviate a
little bit from my mom's recipe.
Hers is just soy sauce,
salt, pepper.
I put a little sugar in mine
because I like to balance
the sweet and the salty,
some salt, some black pepper
or white pepper.
Get in here with your hands
and really get this mixed up.
These are my favorite
wonton skins,
so these are Hong Kong
style wonton skins.
They have a little starch
on here
to help everything
kind of stick together.
What we're going to do is put
a little water on the edges.
So this is like a dessert spoon,
like a tea, really for, like,
tea and coffee
and about this much,
so it ends up being just, like,
a little less than a tablespoon.
What's really important here
is that you don't
overfill your wonton.
I bring the points
a little off center,
and then I push the air out,
and then in my left hand,
I hold the wonton,
and then I really just bring all
the points together,
and then I pinch.
The way my mom does is
a bit of a pain in the ass.
How my mother would make these,
point to point
and then bring the tip together,
so maybe for our purposes,
why don't we just make it
the way my mom makes it?
You know what?
I haven't seen her in a bit.
This soup without fail will get
requested by all my cousins.
They'll pose it on, like,
you know, on a text chain.
They'll be like, "Hey, what
do we all want to eat
for Christmas?"
And without fail,
they'll always ask my mom,
"Can you make wonton soup?"
-You want me to really
bang them out?
All right.
I mean, I'll show these guys
how to...
I'll show the way
to bang them out if I'm at work.
Let's do this.
-Fifteen, 14, 13, 12, 11, 10,
nine, eight,
seven, six, five,
four, three, two, one.
[ Cheering ]
-Whoo!
-Four, they're busted.
They busted, goes in the soup
though, don't matter.
It don't matter.
They're busted.
I think it's a labor of love,
and that's maybe why
this was a holiday thing
because you're seeing
so many loved ones, right.
We were seeing all of our aunts
and all of our uncles,
all of our cousins.
I basically wasted half the day
making these
because I'm so slow,
but we have our wontons here.
We're going to go right into
making our stock
that these are
all going to sit in.
So now we move onto the broth,
and this is a shrimp
and chicken broth.
The reserved shells that we
have here,
we're going to use those,
toast that up.
We have a little bit of garlic,
and at this point
it doesn't really matter.
Like, you don't need
to chop it up or mince it.
It's just going in for some
seasoning and some flavor.
So we're going to split
the ginger, give it a whack,
same with the garlic,
and this is where
my mom's recipe
and my recipe
kind of butt heads.
She'd be kicking my ass
right now
if she saw me
putting ginger in this.
She specifically said,
"Dale, there's no ginger
in the recipe."
I literally, like,
10 minutes ago
when I was on the drive up here
speaking to my mother
about this.
Oil in the pot,
and you want this ripping hot.
You want to roast these shells.
You want to get that toasted
shellfish flavor
to kind of infuse with
the chicken into this broth.
This was really hot, so they've
got a beautiful roast in it.
We're going to dump
in our ginger and garlic.
People are fiercely defensive
over the things
that they grew up with.
This isn't illegal.
Ginger and garlic is not illegal
in my stock for my wontons.
So we are going to deglaze this
with a little bit of water
and then hit this
with some chicken stock
and let this simmer to combine
and get tasting delicious.
The oil floating
on the top here,
I think that's really important.
I think that when you see that
sheen of oil on top of you,
you know that you've cooked
with enough fat
that the flavor is going
to combine with this broth.
Put a lot of scallions in this.
It's really kind of the only
other textural element in this
because you want that wonton to
be bouncy, but you want the...
You know, you're not looking
for this beautiful ethereal,
like, al dente pasta.
No, it's like, you've got to
cook the pasta through.
All right, guys.
So our broth has been simmering
away for, like, 20 minutes now,
and what's great about
shrimp shells is that,
you know, they infuse
their flavor very quickly,
so you don't have
to spend all day
kind of
making this broth,
and we've fortified it
with chicken broth,
so we're going to strain
this broth right now
but keep this pot.
You can discard
this shrimp shells
and go right back
into wide pot.
There you go.
And then this is when you want
to season your broth.
We're going to do a little
fish sauce here
or a lot, little salt,
and right now
we're just kind of adding,
like, umami,
umami, umami,
right, and sodium,
so be careful with it,
but this is where
you're going to get
a lot of your flavor from.
On top of the shrimp shells
and the chicken stock
which is going to
give that body,
your seasoning comes from
only these three ingredients.
So now we just drop
the dumplings in.
Pancit means noodle.
Molo is the region
in Iloilo where my mom
is from in the Philippines
that this dish came from,
heavily influenced
with Cantonese culture.
You know when you have
traditional wonton soup in,
like, say you go to
a Cantonese restaurant?
It's not just wontons and broth.
This is really just broth,
the wontons and scallions,
so I think that
that's maybe where
some of the differences are,
but the similarities are bigger
than the differences
in this soup.
You could really see
the Chinese influence
in Filipino food
with this dish.
My mom would take
all these scallions
and dump them in like that.
I ain't that sucker.
I've done enough of this to know
that when you say,
"Oh, you could eat it
right away,"
and then you have some dude
walking around like...
Like, it's scalding hot
in his mouth,
and he's burned his taste buds
for the next few days.
I ain't that dude.
These are ready now.

Noodles are a little hammered,
but you don't mind it.
There's sort of kind of, like,
I don't know,
nostalgic about it, right,
and that's what it is for me.
