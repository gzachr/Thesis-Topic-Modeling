Hello and welcome to the Beverly Hills of
Cebu!
Just like in America here we have Hills and
they are Beverly and as you can see over there
behind me lies the big city of Cebu but today
we're not going in the city today we're going
around so let's go and explore and the first
stop here on our itinerary is the tallest
Temple here in Cebu I want to check it out
so let's go inside
when the temple behind me is called the Cebu
Towers Temple this is a Taoist Temple located
in the Beverly Hills of Cebu and this Temple
was built by the Filipino Chinese Community
here at an altitude of around 110 meters and
because it has so many levels and has so many
Hues it attracts a lot of visitors every year
everybody can can visit this Temple and [Music]
here for example people come to pray to Grand
one's wish and you have a specific ritual
in order to do that and you have you have
to wash your hands before praying to go inside
the chapel Barefoot and to drop two blocks
of wood and if the wood blocks are both faced
out then you can make your wish if not then
it's not yet time for your wish to be granted
and you have to come to the temple some other
time the entrance looks like the replica of
the Wall of China and uh well if you decide
to come here you have beautiful balconies
to observe the Beverly Hills from so let's
check it check this place around and see how
the view from up there 
is [Music]
interesting it kind of reminds me of the Cebu
of Borneo in Malaysia because over there there
was also one of this huge and big pagodas
[Music] this one is on top of a hill and it's
overlooking the city and it's very nice and
peaceful around here and you're supposed to
keep quiet and not make any noise and not
make any uh I don't know disturbance of the
piece doing in Young balance around this nice
Temple [Music] very good GG do you know what
kind of fruit this one is let me see if we
guess um is it a pomelo Yep looks like a pomelo
that's good and there's a lot of them down
and level will be fallen yes some of them
on the tree
it's amazing I like it it's very peaceful
and I like the dragons on the rooftops and
scattered around yes these dragons they are
very nice is something to me something about
the eastern culture and about dragons is fascinating
maybe because in the Chinese Zodiac I'm a
dragon so I don't know I like it I like the
peaceful nature of this area well my friends
now we're going down from the towers to Chinese
temple here in Cebu yeah because we have done
what the people here are doing the customer
the customer activity here people go inside
make a wish and pray to the God and I got
like you can ask as many questions as you
want to know God but you can make only one
wish so depending on like how the stones are
gonna turn that you're gonna throw out in
the air if they're gonna switch on one side
on the other the answer is gonna be a yes
or no or maybe so I got lucky because all
the questions I asked were positive had a
positive answer I forgotten maybe had the
hardest question so oh let's see
um so first a lot of people come here a lot
of people do the same thing so if you're thinking
like to ask some hi thank you if you're thinking
to us some hard questions be prepared for
either one answer or the other so let's see
if this my wish is Gonna Come True it's supposed
to happen in December let's see fingers crossed
I do charbel who is I think he's watching
the video I don't know he's from Lebanon really
really cool guide hi to everyone watching
from LeBron maybe we will come to your country
one day that would be awesome [Music] okay
after we visited the temple it's time for
us to go continue driving towards our next
destination oh and by the way we got this
nice bike and helmets and everything from
our friends at zg driving rental very nice
people check them out if you wanna run the
bike from them as well let's go [Music]
foreign [Music]
[Music]
rough road ahead okay there's one thing you
learn here in the Philippines Never follow
the GPS completely you have no idea when you
might end up in a situation like this so let's
go all the way around and then there somewhere
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
GG are we still in the Philippines or are
we somewhere in Greece what do you think
I've never been to Greece you've been there
but I recognize the gods and goddesses let
me show you something cool come with me come
with me and let me show you something cool
the coolest of the cool
oh this is [Music] huh did I do good or not
this is a nice area right we're deep inside
the mountains and it's getting cooler now
those dogs are barking and you can see the
whole almost whole Island from here over there
you have the oh all Cebu and then behind you
have maktan Island which is where lapu-lapu's
statue is and behind that you have some more
small Islands and behind behind behind you
have Bohol Island oh that's bull the big one
yes that's so cool right yeah what is the
small one near mactan uh I think it's Santiago
siargao something something with this yes
and over there you have the huge ocean where
Magellan came in from and the sunsets it's
from that side yes okay let's go inside this
Palace and explore it a little bit around
and then after that we can get some food okay
cool if you've ever gonna visit Cebu make
sure you visit this place it's a bit outside
of main Cebu but it's totally worth it it's
it's beautiful it looks like an ancient Palace
and it has statues of or karate Tides I think
they're called of old Muses and gods and goddesses
and Greeks and we also have classical music
inside which is really really really sweet
amazing place it does it is it looks beautiful
with the two golden lines on and the career
tides and the little statues of Muses and
uh I don't know I think it's the grease I
think it's the grease Pantheon or is it the
Roman pants yeah I think it might be the Greek
one because I saw Poseidon over there I saw
Athena I saw I love Mythology by the way it's
one of my favorite things ever and uh it looks
so so nice so happy we're here and you have
this amazing incredible view of the whole
Cebu Island wow oh the whole Cebu City actually
and the two islands after the Australia behind
me and it's beautiful here during the sunset
because just look at it it looks like Venice
like I mean Athens yes this is a nice area
Gigi I like it and that's it you have statues
you have horses we have a lady here sitting
and you have to go inside Gigi the Temple
of Leia Leah yes Elia is sitting there on
the throne wow this place is also known as
the Taj Mahal of the Philippines which is
amazing because for example this place this
temple temple it was built by Leia's husband
oh wow there's a lot of antiques here okay
I hope I can show you a few of them so all
the rooms this is a massive place right you
have the entrance you have a lot of columns
and it definitely resembles the pantheon of
crease and why does it resemble the pantheon
of Greece because Leah she was she loved antiques
very very much and her husband built her this
uh Temple let's say Mausoleum or like a remembrance
place for her where they stored all of their
antiques they bought in their travels so they
filled up 24 rooms of This Magnificent Palace
and this is where they rest now you can see
a few of them but they're close to the public
but through these Gates through these windows
you can see them hide the knives it's totally
different and now that night has come you
have a very nice view plus everything is lit
up and looks very cool and I wonder what's
behind because usually if there's a something
cool in the front something nice in the back
there should be as well and that is properly
explore this area okay so in the back there
are some dumpsters there's a [Music] power
tool and there's some stairs I wonder where
these chair sticks us because I mean there's
only one way to find out you have to go all
the way to the top and the place out well
GG is a exploring the inside of the area I'm
exploding the top of the building okay oh
I wonder what we'll have here
okay interesting there seems to be some people
around here let's ask them some questions
uh I have a question for you guys oh look

it's built in the honor of a very beloved
wife and another thing is that this is supposed

a long time so far I'm pretty impressed with
CB Cebu and surroundings the city is crazy
but in a good kind of way I mean it's not
overwhelming and the surroundings they're
very very peaceful it's like you're in a totally
different world yes you go into the mountains
