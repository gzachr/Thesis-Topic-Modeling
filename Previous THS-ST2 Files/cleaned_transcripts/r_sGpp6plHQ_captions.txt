Hi guys , how re you?
I brought one more vídeo for you here in my channel
this time Rico will participate
We gonna record a vídeo
for to show more a less
How is the Filipino noodles
So we gonna show you how
is the preparation
not really HOW TO prepare ...
but we gonna show you the flavours they have
that is a kind of
noodles that i love
from Phillippines
And i will show you more a less
What is the recipe 
and what is the condiments that come together in the pack
of a Filipino noodles
The noodles today is a PANCIT CANTON
I will show you how it is
This one is is calamansi (lime) flavour
that in Phillippines we call calamansi 
That is a small kind of lime
and they have there in the Phillippines
And this is the  flavour of calamansi
So, usually...
The brand name is from lucky me!
They own noodles brand there
 
they re the one who produce this
That is a very famous dish in the Phillippines
Obviously
of course it is
this is only the version of the pancit canton
is not the pancit itself
that sometimes is prepare with rice noodles
So i gonna show you
How we gonna prepare...
This is the spicy!
You can see is already red 
that
is another version of the same pancit canton!
but this one is spicy
so the flavour is different!
I didn´t bring the original
because is gonna be the same
but without the another condiments like spicy and calamansi
that come ready together with the powder mix
So i gonna show you now!
So amore , do you gonna help me?
is it ok?
R:Let´s get started!
So He gonna be my assistant today
because i gonna show you
and we ´re only  two
So we gonna make the first one
that is the pancit canton 
Calamansi flavour
It comes in this ...
this things...(thinking)
in this pack of noodles
here in the back like all the noodles
it shows how to prepare
obviously
you put in the pan
but how we don´t have here
right now
We gonna show you
another way of cooking
Filipino don´t cook like this
of course but
here
in this space i have
We gonna do like that
We don´t have stove
alright?
Here is written
''CHILLIMANSI'''
That is the lemon a
and come a little bit of spicy too
So here is written
(better to serve hot)
Ready in three minutes
Here they show how is 
the original Pancit looks
is not with soup is dry
Like our noodles that we strain the water
and here the brand lucky me
Written pancit canton
Let´s get started!
Now is the main part of the noodles
which is the...
You guys can see that is totally different
from Brazil
This 
come the mix powder
that makes the flavour
the tasty
this one
is the oil
for better mix 
with the noodles
and this come like soy sauce
bittersweet 
is like Tarê
right?
R: YES
So Romarico confirm that
and Lucky me , famous brand in the Phillippines!
(continue)
HOT WATER
COOK FOR 3 MIN
Guys we gonna wait like 3 minutes
Romarico is behind recording for me
And 
I´m preparing this noodles
Remind you that they don´t cook like that
They cook in the house , in the pan!
This is the ship style of cooking
When we´re hungry
after duty
We prepare like this...
Put some hot water
cover up
And it will cook at the same time
Remember that the noodles
can´t overcook
Need to be more like Italian pasta
a bit hard ( al dente)
Ok? So let´s continue...
While the another one is getting ready
We gonna make
the Pancit canton 
that is hot extra chilli
Usually in Asia
they always have food that is very spicy
Very spicy!!
So here is already with red color
The red means that is 
almost are all spicy
If you´re in Asia
and see that the pack is
Red
is because usually
is very spicy!
ok?
So here
is a noodles
here said that is thinner noodles
So is more thin (fine)
Lucky me
Here show how
We prepare
and i will show you how many calories
have in this noodles
from the Phillippines
is 331 cal
total
Let me see if i´m teach you guys right
(english)
to mix all the condiments
Why it says that we have to...
dry the water first
before we put the powder?¹?¹
R: to strain first

is written to mix the powder
AHHH NO NO NO!
They only draw simultaneously
Here says what is the ingredients
all this things!
and the sauce is it....
SOY SAUCE

and PAPRIKA
Let´s see if we can already make this one
is the hot extra chilli
that will be Romarico who gonna eat
because i don´t like spicy that much
Here we have the same thing
But remember
that the chilli
is this one!
The oil come in the previous
