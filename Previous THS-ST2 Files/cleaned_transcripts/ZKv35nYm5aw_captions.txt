[Music]
I've been living in London 
for the last two months now  
and it's crazy there's a million people everywhere 
it's also great just because you can do whatever  
the [ __ ] you want like I'm literally 
filming in the middle of the street [Music]  
so we made it to the final episode we've 
traveled to a lot of restaurants this year a  
lot of great home cooking a lot of unique twists 
and variations depending on which city has them  
and I think this episode is going to be 
kind of similar to that I want to show  
you the places that I usually go to and find 
myself saying oh this is quite interesting
[Music]
so I catch myself going a lot to this 
place this place is called panadera [Music]  
it's a bakery and also coffee shop that's they 
serve this really really good breakfast sandwich  
and yeah I always get this corned beef 
sandwich that's really good they said it  
was featured in Vogue at one point that 
was interesting they also served these  
unique lattes with like Ube or like pandan 
flavor I've actually tried both [Music]
so I'm on my way to the second place this one is 
a Ramen place that is quite unique it's called  
Ramo Ramen they have two ramens that 
I've tried that I'm excited to share with you  
I'm also meeting with a good friend of 
mine that lives here she's doing her  
Masters here too her name's Gen 
and we're friends from way back
so the first one was really cool I've never tried 
anything like this before it's uh sinigang Ramen  
so there's this spice to it 
that um is very interesting  
you know like it's very familiar but it's 
also so unique that you don't really think about  
sinigang you can like taste the sinigang element 
to it but it's enough for it to be to make sense  
second one also very crazy it's a 
Kare-kare Ramen I realized that
that's where the Kare-Kare flavor is 
so you just have to mix it well
as my mother would say always all 
right I'm gonna finish mine too  
I'm almost there I was talking too 
much I think foreign [Music]
it looks yummy so try to imagine 
calamansi juice with alcohol
it looks like it's made from real guava 
with the color and also like the fiber to it  
so fun fact guava is used for healing 
purposes in the Philippines I noticed  
because after I got circumcised wow 
that's the key to heal faster [Music]
with healing
so again this is going to be the final episode 
for the season and I just want to thank you  
guys for supporting the channel we've been to nine 
cities we've been to a lot of Filipino restaurants  
and I can't wait to go to more 
cities in the future and if you  
have any suggestions on where we should 
go next just leave it in the comments
so time for some desserts the next place is 
actually an ice cream place it's called mamasons  
Dirty ice cream so my teeth are getting black 
they serve Filipino flavored ice cream [Music]
so there is charcoal to it oh that's 
so cool thank you look at that  
so the one that's quite popular is 
the black book it's also served with  
a black cone and it's made from charcoal 
apparently all right all right cheers
[Music]
the flavor that I have is the black buko as 
well and I noticed that whenever you have any  
kind of Buko dish whether it be a buko pie or a 
buko drink you always have those bits 
[Music] 
now I'm jealous of the kids who 
had this yeah so I've been here a  
couple of times I've actually tried 
other flavors too like the cheese, ube
and they're also good I always 
come back here I always recommend
foreign
[Music]
so this is the final place now this place is one 
of my absolute favorites here it's called Filishack
I love the fries with chicken inasal 
or like the adobo it's so good big fan
that's always what I get, the fries 
with chicken inasal and they put all  
types of sauces to it so it has so much flavors 
there's like Mayo hot sauce I think ketchup too  
but then it has the chicken inasal flavor 
with Crispy fries oh I'm craving right now  
and you can also get it with chicken adobo flavor beef adobo there's a couple  
more but like I've only ordered inasal and Adobo 
I guess I have to try the other ones too [Music]
