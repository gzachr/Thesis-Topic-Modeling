-Because it's during Lent,
so I don't usually
eat meat on Fridays
because I've been asking my dad
for the recipe.
Like, just giving tips,
and my mom's like,
"Wait, you're going to
eat meat on Friday?"
It's like, "Nah. I'm just
going to cook it."
But I think I'm gonna
eat meat.

Hey, guys. My name
is Gil Payumo,
chef,
co-owner of Señor Sisig,
and today, we're making
lechon kawali sisig.
First, you want to start
with our pork belly,
and you want a good combination
of meat and with this fat cap,
because that's what's going to
give you the crispiness.
And we want to cut this
into like three pieces,
about three to four
inches each slice.
So, lechon kawali
is a Filipino dish.
Lechon is kind of
like a roast pig.
Today we're using
pork belly.
And kawali is some kind of
like a pot or a pan
in Tagalog, a Filipino dialect.
You know,
it works together.
You're cooking the piece
of pork belly in a pot
with some water
and also you're deep frying it.
So, I got a yellow onion,
and we're just going to use
a quarter of it.
Just do a quick rough chop,
and we're going to be placing
this into the boiling water
behind me.
Next, we have some peppercorns
that we want to put in it.
About, like, two tablespoons.
And we want to keep these whole
because they're going
in the water anyway.
Then we're putting some
bay leaves in there.
Just regular kosher salt,
two tablespoons of that.
Then we got some peeled garlic.
About three cloves in there.
So, since you have the water
boiling in the back,
you have your pork belly
that you cut up,
and it's going to cook for about
like 40, 45 minutes.
And you want this
to kind of tender up in there,
and you're going to check it
from time to time.
You know, it's hard to
over boil this
as long as you're not going like
two or three hours
or something like that.
It's pretty tender.
So I'm going to take
these pieces of pork belly
and I'm gonna put it on
a cooling rack,
you know, letting it sit.
After a couple of minutes,
the next step
is take into your fridge.
Overnight is the best.
So, since the pork belly
has been sitting overnight,
now you know this is
definitely a lot smaller.
It's drained out of a lot of,
like, some of the moisture,
the fat.
Probably quarter
of the size. It kind of shrank.
So you know
some of the moisture
has just been
drained out overnight.
And again,
this is very important for you
before your deep frying
any of your pork belly pieces.
Alright, our next step
is kind of poking the fat cap
with this weird tool
that you have here.
It's kind of like a tenderizer.
It's a pork belly meat poker.
Or if you don't have this,
you could use a fork.
You could use some toothpicks,
like some skewers.
You get this
at the Asian market.
And what this is doing
is just getting right
under that top layer
so some of the air
could come out,
some of the fat can come out
when you're deep frying it.
So you want to constantly
do this, like,
for, I don't know,
two or three minutes.
So constantly poking
this fat cap --
with this dish,
the lechon kawali sisig,
I think this all started
from family parties growing up.
We used to have lechon,
basically our whole roast pig,
that's at our parties.
It comes whole
and everyone gets to enjoy it.
We chop it up.
You know,
there's layers of skin,
layers of meat,
pieces from the pork.
What do we do
with the leftovers?
And it's all about,
in Filipino food,
it's like resourcefulness.
You know,
what can we do with leftovers?
How can we turn it
to another dish?
Taking the lechon
from a previous day,
chopping that up,
and making sisig out of it
is something that we used
to do growing up.
And the important thing before
we get into the deep frying
is letting it sit.
With the temperature
of hot oil behind me
and also semi-cold
piece of pork,
you don't want those two kind of
like fighting each other.
You're going to do
a lot of splattering.
It's going to get
kind of dangerous.
You could see I kind of
generally seasoned the top,
the outer layers,
the inner layers.
You can use different ways of
frying the pork belly
for lechon kawali.
I have a crock pot because
it retains a lot of heat,
but also regular medium pot
works.
So something
also you want to have
when you're flying stuff,
this little guard over here.
I think it's called a splatter
guard or something like that.
And this is important
because you're going to deal
with all this oil splatter.
You want to kind of protect
yourself.
For one, be as safe as possible
in your frying,
something like this.
Again,
you want to start off slow
and also not completely
covering at all times.
You want some
kind of circulation.
You don't want to trap
the moisture in there.
And that's a big thing
when you're frying anything.
So with the oil, again,
you could use a thermometer
to check the temperature.
375,
and we're going to do
fat side down.
So, usually, there's
different variations
with lechon kawali
itself.
You know,
I'm doing a deep fry version.
You could also roast it.
You could also stick it
in the air fryer.
Deep fry
is definitely the tastiest?
Of course not.
There's a lot of oil involved.
So, if it's not angry
and it's not like shooting
oil at you right now,
this is like a good time
for you to put another one.
All right. I'm about to put
the third piece.
Again, you want to check
the first piece I put in there
to make sure it is getting
some color on that fat cap.
All right.
I got the third piece going in.
♪♪
So, my first piece
has been deep-frying
for about five minutes now.
Now it's time to turn that
around on the meat side down
to make sure we're getting
both sides kind of deep-fried.
Also, check your other meats
to just make sure you're not
overcooking them or anything.
You can really
tell by the color.
If you're getting
a little golden brown color
on top of the fat cap,
that means you're right on time.
So it's been about five minutes
on each side.
This is our first step
of taking that first one
that we were deep frying
and letting it rest.
And the reason why
we're letting it rest
is because we want it
to deep fry it again
to get that extra crisp on top,
especially
if you're not satisfied
with that top layer
being really, really crispy.
First piece looks really good.
Again, the good way to test it
is take your knife
and kind of rub it
on the top like this.
I mean, it's not quite there,
but once you start
resting it again,
it gets back to like
a semi-room temperature
and you fry that again,
it's going to develop more of,
like, that crisp on top.
So we're halfway there.
All right.
I'm going to take out these
other pieces of pork belly.
Since that last one
is a smaller piece,
I'mma go ahead and take
that out now,
and again, we're going to let
this rest for about,
I don't know,
probably, like, around
10, 15 minutes.
I mean, it looks pretty good,
but definitely
not satisfied enough
for it to be super crispy.
So since I got the lechon
kawali resting right now,
we've been resting
this pork belly
for about 10 or 15 minutes.
Cool down a little bit so we
could do a double fry again.
So we want it
to get even more crisper
because that's the highlighted
part of the dish.
Fat side down again,
and this time you can go ahead
and start putting them all
at the same time.
But definitely still be cautious
because you never know
what the oil's going to do.
So it's been about five minutes
already,
deep frying in there,
and I've turned it around,
so make sure
the meat side is down.
I'm gonna start slowly
taking it out
and putting it back
onto the cooling rack.
Whoo.
So, you can see the color change
a little bit more.
You're getting
more of the crackling top,
and that's what we kind of want.
And you're getting more of
like the brown color.
I don't think you get
more crispier than that,
especially later on, when
we're going to start slicing it.
Of course, you got to cool
it down definitely
for another 10 minutes.
So our pork belly's been rested,
and now
we're going to start slicing it.
So the first thing you want
to do
is we're going to slice it
down the middle,
and this is between the fat
and the meat side.
You can see
it's fully cooked inside
and all the flavors should be
all locked in in there.
And I'm going to do the same
to all the pieces.
So this is probably like
the best part.
I mean, this is for all
that work
you've been doing,
all that poking,
all that deep-frying,
all that cooling.
Let's go up top.
So what we're doing is kind of
chopping up into small pieces,
and you already
hear the crackling.
And that's going to be
the biggest part in this dish,
is the crackling part.
[ Meat crackling ]
Now you got the meat side.
So we're just cutting this
into like quarter inch dice,
or the smaller is, the better.
All right,
so our next step is
making the lechon kawali sisig
marinade.
The first thing we want to do,
I mentioned on the recipe,
I encourage you guys
to use a hot plate.
But if you don't,
you could use a sauté pan
and do the same thing
and heat it up
and put the sisig on there
and let it sizzle.
So I'm going to put this
on the stove, crank it up,
and this is going to sit here
for about, like, ten minutes.
First thing we're
going to be doing
is adding the yellow onions,
basically around, you know,
half a cup or so.
Also have some red onions
and chopped garlic,
diced fresh green jalapeños.
I took the seeds out, and I got
the Thai chilies here.
Again,
these are really spicy.
It's totally optional
for you guys.
I feel like it adds a really
good color and that kick,
so I put, like, three to four
because I like it spicy.
I say a half a cup
of lemon juice.
I'm going to save some of that
lemon juice for later on,
because I do want to hit the hot
plate with that,
and also have a cup
of the soy sauce.
So we got all the stuff here
in the sisig marinade.
So, yeah, the flavor.
What I'm looking for
in this sisig marinade
is definitely
the sourness from the lemon.
But you have all
these spicy notes
with the green jalapeños,
the Thai chilies,
also a little bite
from both of the onions.
All those ingredients together
kind of cuts the fat.
So once you're combining
everything,
everything's going to
mold together
and it's going to become
a dish that's fully balanced,
but more on the acidic side.
And once this gets all
in the hot plate,
everything is just going to be
10 times more intense.
And that's what we want.
You're going to see
all the smoke coming out,
all the fat kind of
rendering out again.
But you're still going
to have that crispiness.
And that's what we want.
And that's what's special
about lechon kawali sisig,
is it's the texture,
you know?
All this process we've been
doing from deep-frying,
you want that texture
at the end of the day.
All right, then we're going
to be adding some black pepper.
Make sure
that's mixed all together.
We have our lechon kawali sisig
ready.
Now I'm going to go behind me,
where I got my hot plate
over here ready to go.
So the first thing I'm going
to be doing is taking the sisig
and pouring it
on this hot plate.
All right.
The next thing we want to do --
we have that leftover soy sauce
and lemon juice.
I'm going to just put
a little bit more in there,
and you can't go without an egg.
So, right now, I'm going
to be using the egg yolk,
not the white part,
just the yolk.
And I'm going to just mix it
all together.
As you can see, all the fat
is all rendering out,
heating up all the marinade,
getting all
the soy sauce together
and the lemon juice.
Once that's all incorporated,
I'm going to finish up
with some green onions,
some more lemon.
Two Thai chilies
just for garnish.
All right.
That's ready to go.
Just pour a little on
my rice here.
Make sure to get some of that
Thai chili in there.
Spicy, but good.
From all the notes,
from the sourness,
from the lemon juice.
You got the Thai
chili kicking in right now,
and you get some of that char
from the cast iron.
Intensifies everything.
Damn.
That's good.
