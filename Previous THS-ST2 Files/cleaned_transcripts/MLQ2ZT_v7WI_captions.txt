 is the insane vibratos of the great singers. So, let's react!!!
And it has a detail, both Christina and Mariah.

In the case Mariah made a beautiful vibrato but also an excellent melisma, 
In the case Mariah made a beautiful vibrato but also an excellent melisma, 
as well as Christina who made a melisma that is one of her specialties.
They really are great voices and great singers,
but we have to note that the focus of this video really is the vibratos.
but we have to note that the focus of this video really is the vibratos.
But they never do just vibratos.
Always close to the vibratos has a note support
or at certain moments they ended up making a wonderful melisma.
But it is interesting that the use of vibrato up to the moment in all these cases, 
But it is interesting that the use of vibrato up to the moment in all these cases, 
they use very much the administration of air into the lungs
so that they can sustain the note in the time necessary
to be performing not only only the vibratos as the melismas,
to be performing not only only the vibratos as the melismas,
because to accomplish all this, it is necessary have a reserve of air in the lungs.
No doubt and we see that in the case was still performed a vibrato 
and made with the use of the chin.
And it is possible to do both with the use of the chin or not.
And it showed Jessie J.
and I consider her an incredible singer, and she for me is already on a very high level, 
because her...
It seems that she invented some techniques.
She does some very innovative things with her voice, 
although there are people who find her timbre boring, something very much...

although there are people who find her timbre boring, something very much...
Very tiring to hear.
Tiring the way she sings... And what do you think?
I think Jessie J. a great singer 
and I think technically speaking, what she does with her voice,
are very complicated and difficult things
and of course in regarding the technical factor,
each singer can reach a level of difficulty,
each singer can reach a level of difficulty,
but what Jessie J. does with her voice is sensational.
I find her a wonderful singer and we admire her so much for it.

So do other singers like Mariah Carey, Christina, but each...
Amber has a wonderful voice.
And a very powerful voice Amber has an extraordinary voice.
And it gets difficult because all the voices are extraordinary.

It's a lot of excitement.
And here comes the osbervation that you did about the air reserve has to be very good

and the control of the vocal cords excellent
because it is necessary that they stay relaxed so they can make these ripples with their voice.

Is it possible to realize the need to have this reserve of air in the lungs?
Is it possible to realize the need to have this reserve of air in the lungs?
Because otherwise, it is not possible to sustain the note and perform the vibrato.
And the use of vibrato consists in note support...
With the potency they use the voice and how they use that support
With the potency they use the voice and how they use that support
this is what will determine how much it will be possible
and have capacity of performing the vibrato.

In addition to the use of Belting requiring mastery of the diaphragm.
In addition to the use of Belting requiring mastery of the diaphragm.
Exactly and we can not forget to mention
that the vibrato occurs exactly inserted in the use of Belting.
And it is precisely in the use of Belting that we can not forget
about this detail of the Air Reserve in the lungs,
because if you don't have that reserve in your lungs, 
you can't sustain the note for that long, to be able to perform the vibratos.

The voice is very clear.
I don't know if it's my impression, but I realize that this is not a rule.
I don't know if it's my impression, but I realize that this is not a rule.
Of course, this is not a rule, 
but Asians, they have a tendency to ... 
I don't know why but many of the artists we check in this compilation are Asians
I don't know why but many of the artists we check in this compilation are Asians
and everyone is in a very high voice region.
Everyone has a very clear and loud voice...
-Very bright.
-Very bright.
Yes, even the last singer we heard, 
the way he sings and the way he uses vibrato,
seems a lot like what heavy metal singers do.
We see how incredible and fascinating the use of voice and vibrato is.

Because in the beginning, an artist appeared and I think the name is David Phelps

I may be wrong, but he seemed to sing gospel music.
I may be wrong, but he seemed to sing gospel music.
Because of how the vibrato was being used, 
it is good to see how this technique can be used.
And to see how nice it is and how it sounds very beautiful,
And to see how nice it is and how it sounds very beautiful,
when the artist has control of his voice, because in that case,
we see that they all do the vibrato at a very high volume of the voice
we see that they all do the vibrato at a very high volume of the voice
and they're also using Belting.
So we realized that it's not just using the vibrato with a contained voice,
but to know how to give a brighter tone to it and that leaves more nice to hear.

Perfect.
If you leave, he stays like this all day.
We see that some artists are focusing more on melisma than vibrato itself.

So that was one of the first observations we had.

Because they don't just do the vibrato.
It is always vibrato along with something and always in use of Belting.

But I want to make a quick remark on what you said regarding styles.
But I want to make a quick remark on what you said regarding styles.
And we can identify the use of vibrato in the way it is inserted
And we can identify the use of vibrato in the way it is inserted
it is inserted within the context of each composition and musical style.
We realized that one singer was in gospel music 
and the other was in a style more rock music, heavy metal.
Therefore, we can identify how the voice is projected 
from what is performed within the musical style.
Although it is the same thing, but in different contexts.
For those who are studying and want to sing,
it is very important that you listen to various types of singers
in various areas and musical genres 
so that you can have a more enlarged view of how you will behave within each style.

Very good.
And we see that this last singer only reinforces what we talk about, 
it is very melisma and some use melisma more than the use of vibrato.

But I liked this compiled because it showed great artists,
and also from different genres, so we can hear

how vibrato can be used in different genres and how the voice behaves in these styles.

how vibrato can be used in different genres and how the voice behaves in these styles.
Because even if the technique is the same, it is used differently 
from the musical context, in the arrangement
and mainly within the genre of every musical style.
So it really was awesome and a lot of these singers
