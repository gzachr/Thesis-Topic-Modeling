welcome to Manila now Manila when I think 
of Manila I think of like super old churches  
hundreds of years old yeah it's a it's a 
historic City would you not say yep with  
lots going on lots of food vendors and a little 
bit of grit no like there is another set to  
Manila that's like Ultra Luxe and that is of 
course the mall scene we are here at SM Mall  
I do believe the biggest mall in the Philippines 
nice so we're gonna head in we're gonna check it  
out see what's what it's uh what time is it so 
it's one o'clock we have not had lunch yet so  
we'll certainly be sure to hit the food court 
and just check it out I mean when you look at  
Google Maps and hit the mall there's all types 
of things in here to uh discover if this place  
is huge it's like two blocks yeah it's a mega 
a mega mall as they say so we're gonna hit in  
we'll go right past security but uh yeah looking 
forward to seeing what this mall is all about  
all right so just past security and immediately 
hit by Shake Shack one of our favorite burger  
restaurants uh but before we just Dive Right 
into that we are going to walk around a little  
bit just to sort of see what's out here see what's 
available I have a hunch this mall is going to be  
filled with good eateries although Shake Shack is 
uh quite tempting uh we just actually had it the  
other day on delivery so we may I think I said 
we hit our Shake Shack limit no okay well that  
could be the go-to forest is always down for 
Shake Shack because they have those hamburgers  
look there's a what sushi sushi in the mall we can 
find out yeah okay so you walk in and immediately  
the air is crisp and cool it's all decorated for 
Lunar New Year's China New Year uh yeah it's all  
all decorated out for that Jolly B KFC so all The 
Usual Suspects all right here in the mall Forest  
is it cool in here yeah this is more like 
there that's right baby it's all there  
all right so beautiful I mean it's like it feels 
good in here wouldn't you say it's a it's like a  
beautiful the colors are crisp big bright please 
yeah it feels spacious yeah that's nice I like  
that nice small aircon I was just saying it feels 
like even and smooth kind of a nice fragrance in  
the air there's all the food might be all in 
this area well I was just so even I'm a Dairy  
Queen I was just kind of talking about that 
I have a hunch it's probably like a Central  
Food Court somewhere maybe you can check that 
out there's something I saw a sign for food  
that's where we want to go food Hall all right 
so Kelly wasn't kidding this mall stretches for  
like a couple of blocks so although that looked 
like the main entrance it doesn't really open up  
into a big Corridor it's just like multiple 
wings so we'll have to sort of figure out  
where that I kind of how this is organized I 
see things like entertainment Mall there's an  
Ikea here apparently movie theater IMAX 
all right Kelly uh The Body Shop you had  
mentioned that as a maybe stop in store are 
we gonna swing in I'm gonna swing in because  
I won't have a body shop for another six months 
yeah this is true now we go back to Indonesia  
um we're into bagapura right so that's way out in 
most popular there are no malls there are no body  
shops so uh maybe we can swing it here and uh see 
what's what see what they have vegan stuff check  
that out cool yeah I mean nice they usually have 
testers and I like the testers I like tea tree  
oil oh all types of tea tree products okay so 
we'll spend a minute in here and uh grab some  
stuff all right so a little hand lotion and look 
you were saying like traveling with that stuff  
so I like to eat them in small amounts because I 
like to we travel and we don't have them we bring  
everything carry on right so um I don't want a 
big bottle of lotion or anything you just want  
a little hand lotion if you're on the airplane 
and it's hot or my Skin's dry and if it's too  
big they'll take it yeah and you don't want to 
like bit a bunch of money on a big size just  
having a ticket at the airport right sometimes 
they stop us for larger items sometimes they  
don't it's just always a gamble right but yeah 
absolutely peanut butter don't travel with pizza  
yeah it always gets taken all right so it looks 
this is all right so we must not be in the main  
mall Corridor because we're we kind of walked 
in back there and now we're already at an exit  
so this I I wanted the next section is like the 
main section that could be yeah a map yes yeah  
I don't see any Maps but uh let's uh we'll head 
Basin shred across so let's see it looks like a  
South terminals there yeah or somehow we're back 
outside so that was not certainly not the main  
section we're like the ice skating rink and or any 
of that so let's yeah head across certainly this  
this is also a mall probably it's like the outdoor 
mall entertainment Mall should we go that way  
all right well check out the entertainment while I 
can see the sign for it but in here it's all just  
sort of yeah restaurants Wendy's oh the great 
there's a sushi place right there oh wait yeah  
so let's go oh that's at the 
train nice yeah we like that one  
are you guys hungry hungry yet or do you 
want to keep going I'll keep going because  
really hungry Sam we can eat a lot all right so 
janky sushi that might be our number one choice  
oh nice so that's more so the sushi than 
Shake Shack yeah yeah we just kind of had  
Shake Shack so I hear you on the sushi also 
so we this is like kind of the first time we  
fast opportunity to get a really good good sushi 
in town I hear you yeah I know Cedar you're  
talking about the Boba Tea it looks like that's 
gonna be pretty easy to find that's that's usually  
all over so that might be the main mall Corridor 
but we're gonna head straight to the entertainment  
ball which is in front of us all right so we're 
actually gonna pull an audible that's still the  
entertainment room behind us uh but we uh Upon 
A further discussion before we dive too deep  
into the entertainment mall we figured uh Sushi 
might be better now to the help of avoid uh you  
know angry attitudes you guys ready for sushi 
yeah yes okay now who's gonna push the button  
to call the trade oh my goodness oh three button 
Pusher wannabe so we'll have to come up with like  
a rotation system or also turn in a big old battle 
you guys ready for sushi okay all right we'll see  
we'll see how that turns out um cool Shrimp Shack 
that sounds kind of fun but I guess Sushi it is  
okay so you order through the app on your 
phone I believe and then it shows you it  
shows up you you deep plate the train and then 
you push the button and the train goes away  
oh yeah but by training it's actually a 
race car I think it's a race car yeah it's  
a race car first what do you see on that 
table oh my goodness what a lazy cat huh  
okay guys let's head in and figure out what the 
Sushi is all about I see if I remember from last  
summer here in Singapore this brand yeah um it's 
a pretty fun place yes like right for more okay  
so uh yeah okay I get it I get it okay okay great 
then uh for our Rice and Noodles like Ramen yeah  
it displays in the side order okay got it and 
if we're ordering I just stopped the food you  
want yeah maximum of six per batch six per batch 
okay so you order multiple batches yes it is a  
maximum of six okay kindly send order double 
check it first and then confirm order got it  
then just a reminder sir once you confirm the 
order we can cancel okay sounds great okay and  
then so we unload from the bullet train in the 
bullet train automatically goes away all right  
automatically got it automatic all right cool I 
think we got it and not for us oh when I tease  
so I recently learned how to use chops oh look at 
that that's that's a good and fine motor skills  
you got going on there shooter yes are you gonna 
try the whole meal with chopsticks hopefully I  
can't wait a minute yeah I'm really excited that 
I learned this yeah yeah it's good times you can  
practice picking up like little rice kernels yeah 
now the real question is are you gonna go for that  
Wasabi this is nice yeah it's like it's mine with 
soy sauce yeah classic I'm old school like that  
that's how it's done don't eat too much because 
it's a burnout and it gets you like in the nose
I'm hoping uh coming soon
okay so oh it's playing music
all right this is for us all 
types of salmon all right yum
