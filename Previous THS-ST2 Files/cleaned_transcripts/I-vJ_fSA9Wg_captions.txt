so we're just about to leave to go
and test some coffee out for delish uh
deli
we just hired our new barista fred which
i'm really excited about
and we're checking out different coffee
suppliers here in cebu city to see who
will be the best
so come along with us
are we allowed in one taxi oh
either uh the good cup
still afraid across the street hell yeah
i'm afraid still
yeah i'm still more afraid of crossing
the street than covet
so we're just showing up to the good cup
uh coffee and this is one of my
top five probably my top three favorite
cups of coffee i've ever had in my life
so when we're looking for the best
coffee for delish deli
i have to take the team here to check it
out and see what they think as well
yeah so what coffees would you like to
serve like you want to serve espresso
and also like filter coffee
for over uh pour over yeah
to begin with but then we'll probably
soon get
a expression from brewer or something
like that as well super timely we were
doing our
um weekly qc copying we do it
almost every week yeah and
for us it's the best method to know
so feel free um these are
some organs from ethiopia a few from
kenya
but normally we work with around 10
to 18 origins in a season
and also one from village
as well but yeah it's great
so we for us for our filter coffees we
roast on the light to medium spectrum
because we want to achieve more clarity
and the street like i think one thing
that
rounds up the poppies on the table it's
all like sweet
it's like caramel yeah so that's what we
want to achieve in our roles
if that's okay yeah yeah yeah
so that's my personal
smells so good i'm looking forward to
trying this next cup here
[Music]
this farm is from panama it's it's
called the pert
90 plus asia farm so we
we love working with them um for us they
produce
the one of the world's best coffee so
the producer produced
five of the six coffees of one world
brewer's cup
yeah and then earlier this year we used
a coffee from them to
win the nationals so it's a very
it's a coffee that usually judges
cannoni taste but
we're trying to bring it here for the
you know the local market to enjoy
there's a very small people that are
willing to buy but
it's it's something that they can never
stop talking about
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
i think they're super knowledgeable
there they really have a culture of
excellence
so we just finished up going to the good
cup uh coffee today and they were very
hospitable
showing us uh some of their best coffees
letting us
taste the number of them uh they're so
knowledgeable
in there and we all learned a lot in
there so i think the most challenging
thing for us is going to be to decide
what coffee we're going to start off
with when we open up jewish deli
you
