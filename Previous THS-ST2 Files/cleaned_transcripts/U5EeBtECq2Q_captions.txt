We are going to Tiger Sugar
This is really the purpose of the video because Tiger Sugar always has a long queue and then...
Gosh, the guard seems to be following us.. look .. look
Thats him guys
I feel anxious, it makes me feel like i did something bad towards DENR
The queue is really  long
The queue is really long in Tiger Sugar
We are queueing
Tiger Sugar!
Boo!
Hey yo! Hey you! How are you and you and you!
So here we are
We saw each other tonight
Because.
We thought of having Tiger Sugar
We just noticed that there's long queues all the time
But we haven't tried it yet
So we'll try
But for now, the queue is just too long
so we'll be queueing later
mostly a place for fancy people
True
We are waiting for our other best friend
Why don't you want to showcase that?
You should showcase this
What are your expectations on tasting Tiger Sugar?
I hope it's delicious but I have a feeling it's going to be too sweet
Okay, expections like it's too sweet
While waiting...
among best friends there will always be someone who's pleasant
that's not me
it's her
I envy the couples
See, they have a dog with them
I can't do this anymore
Okay keep on shaking more and more
my head feels dizzy
The viewers will end up dizzy watching this
So annoying
Was it shakey?
I'm so ugly, gosh
It's so difficult when you have a friend like her
Catriona
There's a lot of pretty and handsome faces here
Thanks
It's blurry, this is your fault trish
Going here makes you whistle
So we've been waiting for the person for some time that we have become a tree
So we are going to start queueing in Tiger Sugar, The queue's really long
we are now queueing
Thara's here, on her uniform
Where's the bride?
Where is she?
The Teacher is finally here
The teacher!
I look like a teacher?!
She's our teacher
Start greeting customers!
It fits you
Stop saying boring, it's annoying
That hurts, you stepped on my foot
Oh good
Did I step on you?
don't
Did I really step on you?
No
Did I step on you Thara?
Yeah
Oh good!
So a while ago we are in front of the Tiger Sugar's sign..
a while ago we are in the Tiger Sugar's sign
NOW, WE ARE STILL IN FRONT OF THE SIGN
It's a sign!
(ugly laughs)
Now you guys know my best friends' humour
I have three jokes
what?
joke, joke, joke
(Filipino Joke)
So we have finished buying
Let's look at our number
The number is ...
wow they can see
Our number is 453
The number is still at 449
Okay lets shake it!
oh wait
so difficult
lets go behind her
i'm so ugly, eff.
(She's trying to pose for a picture)
it's okay
It's just the same like the others
tastes like fresh milk
The taste seems familiar
I don't like its pearl
Yeah, it's so tiny
Taste like milk tea guys
that has milk
it tastes fine
It's just overhyped
The fresh milk made the difference
But I actually really like the pearls
it's a lot
Overall, it's still yummy
I still go for Coco Milk Tea
Tiger Sugar isn't worth the queue
it isn't worth the long line
That's right
I would go buy Coco than queueing the long line again
So that's my content, Bye
