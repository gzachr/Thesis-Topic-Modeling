hello guys welcome back to pinoy planet
today i'm making a very nice filipino
dish
called inihaw na pusit sige lets cook!
it's the first time for me to make it
guys so you have to help me but uh
i don't have kamatis today no tomatoes
unfortunately
so i'm gonna invent the marinade myself
here i have some lovely pusit they're
very tiny so i'm not gonna fill them up
but let's make a marinade
okay so let me add the pusit
tiny pusit to the bowl
okay i'm gonna add a little bit of
suka
and also a little bit of soy sauce
gonna add some black pepper
and i have a spice mixture fish
this make this is a fish herb mixture
i'm gonna add a little bit
some dried dill
and finally some onions or sibuyas
and bawang garlic
okay i'm just gonna mix this
okay i'm gonna cover this and set it
aside for one hour
i also have some nice fish guys this is
um
dorade we say dorade in Dutch i'm not
sure the
Filipino or English name but anyway i'm
gonna
make some cuts and also marinade
if you have any tips for me guys how to
make the fish
extra delicious or the inihaw na pusit
let me know i'm gonna put these on the
barbecue
as well these fish
on both sides
we're going to put a little bit of oil
on the fish
so that they won't stick
i will put onions inside the fish
they're already clean
okay then i will use the same fish herbs
or spice mix just a little bit on top
there we go guys
okay guys it's time to flip over the
fish
oh the skin came up see maybe i didn't
put enough
oil here but it smells amazing
there you see the skin came off
okay okay guys it's also
time to put the pusit
marinated pusit
okay guys i flipped the fish over again
and i put some extra salt
so it's time to take them out
guys some of the pusit fell in the
barbecue but anyway i think
most of them are still good they're
ready to take out so let's do some
plating with the fish
and pusit and let's do the tasting
