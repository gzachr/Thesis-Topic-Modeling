Torta, where we're from, is a ground meat dish marinated in soy sauce, calamansi juice, and pepper.
Start with two pounds of ground pork. And add half a cup of soy sauce,
two tablespoons of calamansi juice, and one teaspoon of black pepper.
Mix thoroughly.
Let that marinade for about half an hour.
Next prepare your scrambled egg mixture, which you'll need two eggs for.
First crack one egg.
Then add one extra yolk. And then scramble well. Set this aside for later.
Once your meat has soaked up all the flavor, start by saut√©ing half a large onion.
And then four cloves of minced garlic. As per usual, add 1 teaspoon of annatto powder.
Next add the meat to the pot and start browning.
Remove the fat and some of the extra liquid.
Once the meat is cooked, add one cup of chopped potatoes. When we cut them this small it takes about five minutes to cook.
When the potatoes are nice and soft, add half a cup of frozen peas.
Usually at this point you can add raisins, but we're not a huge fan of raisins,
so we added half a tablespoon of sugar instead, to add some sweetness to this dish.
Afterwards add the scrambled egg mixture.
This will help clump some of your meat together. When the egg has been fully incorporated and cooked, add 1 chopped red bell pepper.
And after a couple minutes, you're dunzo!
Typically you eat torta with rice, but if you're trying to take it to that next level, pandesal or Filipino
sweet bread is the way to go!
