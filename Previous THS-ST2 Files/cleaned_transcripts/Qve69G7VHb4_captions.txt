Hey guys, we're in Moalboal now, moal boal as the locals
call it. We're trying to do some snorkeling
but unfortunately started raining and it's so cloudy.
Hopefully we're gonna see what we came for
came for and that is the turtles and the
sardines. We approach the first
snorkeling spot and it's where we're
hopefully going to see the sardines
Now, let's see if our luck turns a bit.
Guys, the sardine rush was a success!
Did you like the sardines ?
Yes!
Now we're on Pescador Island and we're snorkeling to
see the coral and then the last stop
will be to find turtles!
I'm crossing my fingers to see at least one turtle !
We've only seen three snorkeling spots in Moalboal
but there are plenty more so
maybe if you've got more time than us
you can stay for a few days and explore
more of them because the three we've
seen looked really great!
In terms of accommodation we didn't see
the resorts and the big hotels that we
saw in Cebu City or in Mactan. There were
a few hostels and small bed and breakfasts.
So we're now going to do the
thing that convinced me to come to Cebu
and that is canyoneering.
So, canyoneering starts with a 30 minutes' hike.
Is the first time I'm glad there's a
cloudy day because if they was son
outside, it would be even more difficult.
Now, let's enjoy our hike!
The first part of the canyoneering trip, the hike,
is over and now begins the fun part!
1, 2, 3, JUMP!
How was that first jump ?
Great !
Were you afraid ?
Yes, I thought I was going to hit the rocks.
Meaning me! I am the rock !
This one has been a little harsh.
It's like somebody smacked you over your head.
Yes, I can hear a thing in my ear.
My ear just popped.
Jump !
Shallow water !
We're done with the canyoneering experience and
now we're approaching Kawasan Falls.
We're at the third level now and we're having
a little hike through water, rocks and
dirt to reach the bottom level of the
Kawasan Falls.
That was the biggest jump of the trip, 10 meters high,
but it was really really nice !
How was the 10 meters jump ?
UUU !
We're approaching level 2 of the waterfall
and it started raining like hell...
We'll do the last jump now,
it's a 12 meter high jump.
Oh, God ! Oh, God !
It's up to you.
Okay!
1, 2, 3, jump !
Hey guys! Our trip to the Kawasan Falls ended abruptly
because it was flooding.
We couldn't lift the drone,
couldn't shoot anything nice ...
But, all in all the canyoneering trip
was really good one !
