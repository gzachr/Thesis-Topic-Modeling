continue down this way and see where we end up 
all right so we're actually gonna walk down a  
little bit further this way I brought us back to 
the main road and we're going to see if we can  
locate ourselves some other uh things to either 
eat or drink this evening my mind is definitely  
set on having a uh delicious smoothie but we 
shall see if that's gonna be possible tonight  
it should be though because during the day 
when I was walking around definitely saw a lot  
of options for smoothie places oh looks like 
they're doing uh free name carving over here

what do you have here brother huh  
what uh what are you selling here oh 
a little puppy cutest little puppy
oh so uh oh you're already making one okay 
hello hello I'm looking to get a free name  
carving today you know which one do you 
recommend we both it's good so we've got  
the boracai keychains yeah all right I'm 
definitely gonna need to get one of those  
I'm thinking one probably with a palm 
tree yeah yeah that sounds uh iOS
400 five pieces for one hand oh five pieces I only  
need uh one piece but I'll 
pay you 100 for One Piece
pen yeah okay then I think I want uh the pen 
please it's one but uh does the ink last a while I  
want to use this for a long time okay does it work

oh oh medical doctor okay that's definitely not me  
um can you write uh my YouTube name please yes

before me to get a engraving yeah
um the first okay perfect oh then let's see here  
yeah so I need something to uh to match this 
I just got this fresh wallet right here kuya  
custom made right there so I'm thinking yeah I 
just got one though but so I'm thinking I need  
a pen to head to the collection okay which one is 
one yeah yeah I'm thinking uh this one that says  
boracai Philippines so I can remember it forever 
okay what do you think these are better yeah
and let's see okay so this one okay 
so this one has no writing on it and  
does it work oh can I test that real 
quick oh this one doesn't work brother
oh okay that's gonna be the 
one there so as you can see  
there's no carving or engraving 
on it yet we're gonna test it out
all that I hope that ink lasts  
because I do want to hold on to this forever 
yeah world no Mac with a c at the end because  
my name's Mac okay how do you engrave this 
you have a custom way of doing it yeah
you got the full on what is that solder iron with 
a drill bit on the end yeah all right let's see

there's a long long distance to get here
all right we got it right there 
so that's World nomac on one side
Mac s oh that looks great that's amazing
and what brother what do we 
do what video movies review
I've been to Singapore you've seen my 
video yeah yeah I was in Singapore in April  
oh you already subscribed no she's perfecting 
the letters right along the edge of it
wow and now we have uh three more right thank you  
oh that's great brother amazing job 
okay Philippines on the back that's  
perfect oh yeah a nice big bee oh there 
we go big b a small little O next to it
this is the best island in the Philippines yeah  
yeah one of the best that's 
a diplomatic answer I like it
oh there it is beautifully done that is the 
definition of the word iOS very good yeah  
amazing job okay amazing job kuya we'll go one 
custom to the uh the next there's a 100 thank you  
very much I don't need change nice to meet you ate 
okay enjoy your time in Boracay yeah let's do it
always do it
see you later goodbye nice to meet you all see 
you good one okay okay thank you all right guys  
we've got ourselves a custom made pen and actually 
when we came up there he was originally I think he  
said five for 100 which would literally mean 
that each one's 50 cents for custom made on  
both sides now I'm not sure how long the ink 
is Gonna Last let me tell you because I did  
use it on the paper but like you can always 
find a way to replace the ink the engraving  
is like incredible I'll keep this pen for an 
absolute lifetime that is a custom-made memory  
that we'll have okay we have come across a Taipei 
milk tea stand so this might be the spot to get  
ourselves a shake we've got oh exactly what I'm 
looking for oh that's fruit tea not a fruit shake  
and let's see chocolate cheesecake there's a lot 
of good looking items here but not necessarily  
fruit shakes there we go mango shake that's 
gonna be the one for today 500 milliliters
could I please have a mango shake yeah
oh one liter how big is the one liter oh wow 
what are these oh okay we'll do a big one then  
yeah okay so I guess we're getting a massive one 
liter of a mango shake but to be honest it's not  
that often I get the opportunity to have mango 
all the time so one liter is definitely gonna  
be the move it looks like they've got some 
delicious food here too they've got burgers  
shawarmas and some other stuff over there I'm 
guessing what they're most known for is their  
milk tea which does look really delicious 
but that mango smoothie's got my name on it
getting it going I've never seen like a 
uh a shakers like basically that's like  
a bartender's best friend you put that 
right on there and you can make them  
uh what kind of uh milk tea is this one 
oh actually you know what I might want  
to change my order to that because you guys 
are most known for your milk teas right also  
for fruiting for the shakes yeah but that milk 
tea chocolate looks really delicious right now  
I think drop a comment below but I think the 
right move is to change from the mango shake  
to the chocolate I mean all these have a really 
good presentation to them what did you guys get
cheesecake in a shake
oh wow that sounds really delicious yeah 
guys the menu is just like absolutely  
massive so many great options here all 
right we've got a lot of uh teas coming  
around this way what are you getting for you 
all right that sounds like a delicious one too
the the chocolate milk tea uh the chocolate
I have either a thousand or 
a card what works better cash
even if it's a thousands
thank you very much sir oh perfect thank you  
all right so now we've got the buzzer here a 
few minutes to wait and we're gonna be getting  
ourselves our first Taipei milk tea right down 
here in boracai Philippines all right all right  
I think this is ours then salamat oh that looks 
fantastic all right straw right there oh yeah
RR all right I love that name that's a great one 
all right let's stab that thing right in there  
okay pull that up yeah yes sir are you a 
future subscriber yeah oh that's perfect

things out delicious yeah

no Mac okay yeah you got it brother yeah  
yeah Skype well thank you thank you thank you

a delicious chocolate milk with a bunch  
of like those bubble tea chewy Gummies 
at the bottom it's literally heaven for  
your taste buds that is delicious enjoy thank 
you have a good night thank you very much bye
this is so tasty guys oh my God 
it is literally the definition  
of what I want in the evening at this 
time it seems like down this way it's  
actually uh quieting down quite a bit 
probably because it is a Sunday night  
but uh yeah I paid 120 I think for this thing so 
a nice big uh bubble tea on the beach comes out  
to just over two dollars so I'd say a pretty good 
price and it's so good like those chewy Gummies  
at the bottom are just um a match made in heaven 
you guys I think we're gonna head down this way  
and see if we can locate some delicious food 
we might have to go to the downtown area so  
I'm thinking we gotta hop on a tricycle so we'll 
go down to the end see if we can locate someone  
and from there we shall go there where's 
the motorbike ride too wherever yeah hello
all right we got poyet taking us down to uh you 
know where the lake is song yeah where the food  
is yeah yeah all right let's do it let's do it 
brother are you leaving am I taking the bike

all right we got to put the seat 
belts on here we go Full Speed Ahead
all right whoa oh [__]
all right seems like everyone's okay long tonight
all right so we're going on the main road here 
the last time I was on the main road guys was  
driving back to the hotel before  
and now we're cruising down this way this 
is definitely much faster than walking
all right we're passing the traffic there
all right looks like we are arriving 
to the downtown area right here oh
and there we go the place place is a little 
quieter at this hour oh perfect one win one  
way here okay that's it and we've got Spa bucks 
right there it sounds like Starbucks but for spas  
time up oh yeah I think uh somewhere uh right over  
here should be good yeah this 
is good this is good all right
know what brother
salamat thank you very much brother all right 
guys after a quick five minute ride we have  
made it down this way and now we've got to uh 
locate ourselves a little something something to  
eat right over here and actually this area where 
we got dropped off at if it was the daytime I'd  
be able to show you but basically there's like 
a lake uh right in the middle here you can see  
people hanging out in their reflection oh 
and a Bitcoin sign right up there too but  
yeah in this area you can find some delicious 
food from what I saw when I was riding past  
it all right so we're gonna check out this 
uh Boracay food truck maybe down this way  
we shall see what's going on over here we've 
got rice bowls that's a good looking sign there  
wow all right rice balls tuna poke bowls Pokeballs 
and all right we might come back here guys I'm  
gonna I'm gonna take a look down this way see 
what the food options are before I come in  
I might be back hello hello I felt bad I was 
standing there for a second they're probably  
like why isn't he buying I'm gonna walk away 
but that's because I just want to double check  
on the food options but I'm actually I might 
have arrived here a bit too late where we're  
gonna be limited on what food options we can 
get at this hour but that being said we are  
going to give a quick little cruise around 
here seems like there's a lot of places to uh  
buy some souvenirs around here fresh sunglasses 
get yourself a Boracay shirt like this one if  
you're looking for it and then further down this 
way we have it looks like Hollow mango so this  
might be where we want to go you can even get 
yourself a little fresh fade Tyler the barber  
stays open that looks like it does everything 
Tyler the barber money exchanger and tattoo
we're past this place like much earlier 
a lot of these places were open so I feel  
like that's the bummer is I was really 
hoping to show you guys like for example  
like hungry manga I'm sure would have 
been an awesome place to get food but uh  
I don't think we're gonna be lucky on that oh 
look at this you can even shoot the Hoops down  
here there's just a randomly a basketball court 
right in the middle of here called Showdown  
they're playing some music there and they're just 
shooting Hoops not too many people are making  
them right now and there we go we got it we got a 
shot someone made one finally I can't talk though  
I would not have made a single shot it sounds 
like we've got some live music down this way
that's a vibe
oh yeah right here that is the one 
part I'll tell you about Manila area
a lot of live music in this 
area so it's it's really nice  
oh some sort of like ferris wheel I 
think it's real too just not open at  
the moment this actually must be like the food 
District because I'm going through this area  
and there are really a lot of options here but 
I'm I'm looking for like something like street  
food kind of like when we first walked in here 
but I want to keep those options open here so  
we've got Andy's chicken like they love that 
around here Andy's chicken is more of like a  
roasted chicken more fruit shakes they do 
love their fruit shakes in the Philippines  
Tres Amigos three friends all Mexican food 
that does sound delicious you guys still  
open for business today yeah okay best Mexican 
food on the island yes all right I'm sold then
okay known best on TripAdvisor okay 
so how are the quesadillas here
oh so a lot of good options then yeah and 
we've also got the option for chicken adobo  
okay I'm thinking that uh I'm 
thinking I'm in let's do it
nice to meet you all right so I 
can sit anywhere let's take a seat  
right uh right over here thank you all right 
so we've got a lot of delish options here  
I'm thinking given we're at Tres 
Amigos definitely needs to try  
something uh with the Mexican flavors to 
it so most likely tacos or the quesadilla  
four burritos that is a very hard decision which 
is better the quesadilla the burrito or the tacos
oh okay is it possible to have this one also with  
beef instead of shrimp so 
I can skip the seafood okay
yes please
and then a bottle of water please oh yeah 
the food has arrived looks like we've got  
some uh sour cream some mangoes and some 
salsa built into there and it looks like  
on the tacos we've got cheese on top some 
shredded beef one hard shell one soft shell  
and it looks like one of those little limes or 
squeezed oh yeah mini looking lime things get  
that on there put a little bit of uh oh oh and 
there we go and there we go Stitch that there  
I said it was fantastic and let's go 
ahead and give this thing a nice taste  
test after doing all that walking it's 
about time to see how this thing tastes
mmm
wow that's incredible literally probably like 10  
000 miles away from Mexico 
and this is a damn good taco
a very rich beef in there with some of 
the local vegetables that I'll tell you  
that hits the taste buds quite nicely 
we've got basically two of these with  
beef the normal combo you get one of these 
with shrimp one of these with chicken one  
of them with beef but now we actually have 
a nice hard shell there loaded with it and  
then this one I dropped some of the beef in 
there so now we have a chicken and beef combo
very good I kind of like what you expect 
for Island prices like high quality food  
comes up to about like I think 400 for 
um these three tacos so you know almost  
eight dollars like seven dollars and fifty 
cents I'd say it's a good price because you  
get really high quality Mexican food 
we're literally dripping right here
that could be a future menu item my friends 
that's mixed with beef and chicken we've got  
two Meats in there and that is fantastic 
you get the best of both worlds there
mmm
that's what we call g triple o d uh you guys that 
was fantastic we polished off the entire plate of  
tacos just gotta get the bill and uh that's 
it oh excuse me is that the bill please all  
right so the total for the bill is uh 632 so 
that's like uh 12 13 bucks roughly like that  
to have a delicious meal all right guys we got 
the total right there 632 with a few bucks extra  
salamat very delicious food thank you thank 
you very much see you next time all right we  
got ourselves salamat got ourselves a delicious 
meal in the belly now guys and now it's time to  
uh start heading back to the hotel let's head 
this way all right so the food District was  
down there we're gonna be walking this way oh 
it seems like uh we've got a big crowd over here  
over at Epic the spot guys so we're walking 
on the road here I mean you can see some  
pretty sick vibeye places we've got pink rope 
lights all around here and [ __ ] little Shisha  
Lounge right there oh and it looks like a uh a 
solid DJ back there even throwing down bangers  
so yeah very uh very interesting oh and I think 
we're pretty much back this looks like the uh  
Hanan Regency right here so after a fair bit of 
walking we have made it all right guys I think  
that's where I'm gonna go ahead and end today's 
video really hope you've enjoyed coming with us
