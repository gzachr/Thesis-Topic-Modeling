if you haven't done so please hit that
subscribe button and turn on the
notification bell
so that you could help us reach our next
milestone and know when we drop our next
video
let's go harper recently we've been
doing a lot of
japanese educational videos so i thought
it'd be fun to switch things up
and teach suzu some tagalog
[Music]
do you know a bunch of tagalog i know a
few what is the first thing that you
learned
in tagalog
that's a good thing to know because if
you have to go you have to go yeah i
know
she just looked at me what else do you
know i know
she learned that because me and my
family always ask each other
but today i want suzu to learn a few
phrases that she's going to need
if she ever wants to visit the
philippines and stay there for a longer
period of time
we will definitely going to visit
philippine hopefully next year
so i need to learn i want to visit and
gain a few pounds
because that's what you do in the
philippines yes exactly
all right what we're gonna do is i'm
gonna say a few phrases let suzu guess
what it means
and we'll tell her what it is as long as
i know the situation i think i can guess
[Music]
the first category is essential phrases
okay
so first thing is
is that one sentence no son
so three three yes three but they're all
kind of the same
like are you from japan no japon
you say this in the morning good morning
what is it good morning
good morning paul
is good morning i said that yeah
oh my god are you from japan
did you eat breakfast no it's good
afternoon
there you go oh my god good morning are
you japanese
no no i thought like something in the
sentence but it makes sense now
all right so the next one is kamustaka
how are you
thank you so she knows the basics okay
next one is okay
yes yes it's just yes yes yes
i hear that all the time but yeah yeah
yeah yeah yeah it's just yes
situation do you say that for example
you're lost you're kind of shy
you don't know who to ask so you see a
person and you go up to them
do you have a map
first of all who uses a map anymore
what does that
[Laughter]
so you're lost do you know where this is
it means can i ask you
[Laughter]
what does that mean again
[Laughter]
yes good job sorry got mixed up she's
still on the map thing
do you have a map
so next category is transportation
kaliwa
or kanan that's all right wow really
yes even i get confused with this
because i don't know which one is which
i think kali wai is left and kanan is
right but filipino people know the
english
i know they do karina okana
next one is
so for example you need to go somewhere
what do you say
it's just going to that station close
is this the right trunk close so for
example you're looking at a map
does this train goes to that place no it
means how do i get to
oh my god yeah just just use your map
okay
wait what was that again
[Music]
that's like where oh it's so hard to
remember
yeah it's a lot of words here like i
know
there's like so many odds but it's okay
you'll learn
all right so the next one is magano and
what situation do you use you're at a
store how much is this
wow yeah how much magano makano
magano it's like a last name that's what
i always ask suzu
whenever she points something oh babe
look i'm like
next one is very crucial to a lot of
people if they want to go to the
philippines because if they know
you're a foreigner sometimes they might
jack up the price
i'm not saying everybody does it because
i know filipinos are very nice people
but you know there's always a few bad
people out there so what you want to say
is that they give you a price
what does that mean you're ripping me
off
i saw this online four hundred dollars
no
so let's break it down what does that
mean is this real
no what does my mean i love this
shoe no love no
mahal means expensive oh i didn't know
that this is too expensive
yes can you make it cheaper yeah
it's like can you give me a cheaper
price so say it again
mahal mahal naman naman
mahal naman
[Music]
it's so hard when we go to the
philippines just make sure i do all the
talking okay
no i use english that's fine too we'll
just use paul
after every word i'm not that dumb
next one is isa one two three
what was it the third one
is
that is it for today i hope you enjoyed
it if you have some words or phrases
that you want me to teach suzu
please let me know i am all ears suzu is
a sponge as you can see
she literally learns it and squeezes it
as usual please like and subscribe
and we'll see you next time bye
[Music]
