It's Mikey b*tch!
At the palengke (Filipino market), I'm shoppin'
For a certain food, I have been cravin',
With tentacles, it's heaven.
In the Philippines,
Comes in many size
We love it dried
We even love it fried
Calamares (calamari)
My blood is high.
It's pusit (squid), masarap (yummy)!
And this pusit (squid) is so WAP, WAP,WAP
“Wet as pusit (squid)!”
I will eat it now
When you’re cooking pusit (squid),
Take out the spine
Let’s grill this squid, inihaw (bbq)
Kinilaw na pusit (squid ceviche), suka (vinegar)
inside,
I'm addicted to squid,
Yes, I love eating pusit (squid).
Make it adobo, too
Yes, I love eating pusit (squid).
Magsasaka (farmer)
I'm a Filipino farmer
Masipag (hard-working)
In the Philippines, I gather,
All my fruits and veggies,
Everything you see's organic,
It's all natural
On my farm, baby
At the farm,
I'll show you my biggest secret,
Like a charm, it will grow your food like
magic
I collect it in the morning from my cows here
in Cavite, it's the bomb,
Love this dung, baby
Fertilizer, fertile, fertilizer, I'm an awesome
farmer, oh
Fruits and veggies I can grow, with my fertilizer,
I grow langka (jackfruit)
I grow manga
Fertilizer, fertilizer, fertilizer
I'm growing my halaman (plants)
Out in the province at my farm
Filipino farmers are the best,
Cuz we feed everyone!
My plants are healthy,
Producing plenty
It's all organic
It's fertilizer.
I'm 1 hr late for my meeting,
But I'm,
Not gunna stress, I'm not rushing,
In Philippines, it's understood we'll not
be on time, 8AM means 9.
I'm not late, it's Pinoy (Filipino) Time.
Just take the bun,
Ice cream inside,
Or pancit (noodles) can work, too.
Now try how fried fish tastes with our chocolate
rice
Beer with ice,
Filipinos will find
Unlikely foods to combine
Mmm salamat (thank you), Ate!
Our Pinoy (Filipino) food,
Is eaten with fork and spoon
and incomplete without rice.
This bagoong (fermented shrimp paste) so salty,
With sour mango's yummy,
Bicol Ice cream
So spicy,
No, there's nothing quite like,
Pinoy (Filipino) food.
Oops I Did It Again:
Oops!
I did it again,
I'm in the CR (bathroom),
It's missing something,
No toilet paper,
Oops, my tabo (pail) is far,
I left it in the car,
Goodbye, my underwear
Slave
I'm an OFW (overseas Filipino worker) dito
sa (here in) Toronto,
I'm preparing a big care package and sending
it back home,
Shampoo, lotion, my old clothes, and soap
from Canada,
They'll appreciate this coffee kahit (even
if) it's expire na (already)
Lots of tape, I used,
It's hard to open
But that's not my problem,
There's toothpaste and shoes,
Corn beef and candies, XXL panties,
Sending
Balikbayan, balikbayan box
Balikbayan, balikbayan box
Balikbayan, balikbayan box
One time I had sore eyes (pink eye),
I could not see,
So infected, and so itchy
And so I asked my mommy:
"Mommy, can you drive me,
To the clinic to get some meds",
She said no need.
I have the best medicine:
Vicks... ahhh!
Lola (Grandma) said,
I look ugly,
Cuz I'm dark,
So I tried, tried, tried to get light, light,
light,
Thinking,
I'd look pogi (handsome),
But to my surprise
I looked abnormal, skin too white!
Trying to look sexy,
While I'm filming,
This TikTok video,
of my dancing,
Oh, crazy cuz I can't get it right,
15 seconds lang (only), but my 500th time.
Again!
I'm a Pinoy (Filipino), I'm a Pinoy (Filipino)
living in the Philippines
in Pilipinas (Philippines) / I'm just eating
munggo (mung beans), I love these beans, yeah
From Baguio to Bohol / Palawan, Cagayan, Aklan
From Davao to Bicol
I love the Philippines,
I'm a Pinoy (Filipino)
In Pilipinas (Philippines)!
The best beach and sun,
Indeed it is more fun,
Here in Philippines,
We are Pinoy (Filipino).
Mabuhay (Long Live)!
I’m free.
