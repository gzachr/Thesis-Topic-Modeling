Jasper, it's time for your swimming lessons 'anak ko'.
(background conversations)
(laughter)
Hi guys! With so much water in the Netherlands
it's not a surprise that parents want
their kids to learn how to swim and so
we signed up our oldest to swimming
lessons every Sunday morning and today
is "kijk dag" which means we can go inside the
pool area to watch them learn.
Swimming used to be a part of the
curriculum in elementary schools here
but due to budget cuts we the parents
now have to pay for the lessons
ourselves and I can imagine you're
asking well how much does it cost?
Well, the answer is they're not cheap
considering it takes about a year for a
child to get his diploma A and then
there's diploma B and C it might be wise
for a parent to always add that into the
budget as soon as a child starts school.
But you know what guys
even so on top of having our kids to
learn a safety skill it also allows them
to learn a cultural skill and I mean this
because here in the Netherlands there
are many water activities for kids that
require a swimming diploma.  And many kids
parties are held in swimming pools not
to mention a lot of family holidays
during the summer do include going for a
swim.
After about 10-15 minutes we were asked
to leave and so most of the parents now
and the kids would hang out outside by
the restaurant and in our case we're
going there to have a quick breakfast.
Hi kids today I went to swimming.
And I went to bath 5 today.
And what does that mean? Is that a deep or..yeah that's super deeper. Did you enjoy
it? Yes. Good so.
ok bye. so. bye.
