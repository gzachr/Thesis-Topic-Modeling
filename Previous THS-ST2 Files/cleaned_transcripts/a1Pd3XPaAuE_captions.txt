[Applause] [Music] [Applause] our family is
on a quest to experience 110 distinct cultures
across all seven continents by the summer
of 2025.
we've spent the past three weeks here in Asia
and we just landed on our fifth region in
the Philippines the island of Cebu by and
large the food we've encountered here so far
has been relatively tame but that all changes
today because we're on a munching mission
and Cebu City offers the most colorful collection
of culinary kicks in the country from fish
balls to horse balls blood to intestines and
eel babies to duck embryos let's start devouring
there's a documentary on Netflix it's called
street food and they have a different series
on that called street food Asia and there's
an episode of street food Asia focused on
the Philippines and it takes place here on
the island of Cebu where we are today one
of the best ways to try street food is at
the local market and this is the biggest it's
sugbo Marcato and they're also called food
parks no Phil's looking for some real adventurous
Delicacies there's such a wide variety of
food here everything from Korean to Japanese
to of course Philippine but uh there's some
specific things that we're looking for tonight
and a fair warning some of them are not for
the faint of hearts or stomach way to start
with something really easy one of the most
popular Street Foods in the Philippines is
and the traditional lechon here is going to
be roasted suckling pig but there's a variation
right here that we want to try and that's
Baka which is a beef lechon you have a quarter
kilo please this is probably gonna be one
of those bites that the whole family tries
thank you we're walking around trying to find
a seat but they're all taken a lot of people
are saving seats and uh we might have to just
see it standing up thank you this is a quarter
of a kilo by the way it's the smallest one
you can buy is that pork beef
you know the texture on this is like like
a rib eye sliced into a bunch of little pieces
but the flavor is completely different because
of the sauce that's on it it's not spicy it's
not too sweet it's just a good like kind of
barbecue roasted flavor char Brooklyn loves
steak so I'm curious to see what she thinks
of this the sauce has like a sugary flavoring
it tastes like steak good and well then I
know you like it the meat is so light it looks
like chicken a little bit Brooklyn's right
there is a lot of sugar in this sauce I'm
gonna try one of the darker pieces a lot of
juicier and now for the quintessential itch
on the roasted suckling pig hello he's taking
the meat right out of the middle of the Pig
right now I'm putting it on our plate this
looks good skin on top and everything go ahead
and just take a piece you can dip it in the
sauce oh you got some skin there good good
best sauce ever well I'm excited this is one
of my favorite things to eat down here so
far I don't need that sauce a lot of vinegar
in it this alone is so Juicy and Delicious
so I love how they put the skin on top of
it
I'm not sure if you're supposed to eat that
as the main attraction or not but I'm gonna
try it first I like it I like a lot it's like
um pork skin jerky almost well you know it's
good because they intentionally put all of
those pieces on top of all of the meat for
us so definitely definitely gotta eat it well
you gotta eat it and that did okay now this
meat smells so good I'm not sure we talked
about how good it smells oh
it is so juicy and I love the sauce too spot
on cold I'm pretty sure you can find lunch
on all over the world and I think it was Anthony
Bourdain who said that Cebu makes it the right
way the best way I agree totally agree next
we're going to have something that I keep
seeing everywhere but I don't know what they
are yet I just know that they're little balls
and they're cooked in a really cool way there's
like a very specific special pan that they're
cooking so what are these takiyaki
takoyaki they're Japanese food and you have
um octopus and pork which one's your favorite
the octopus so we're getting two octopus and
two pork we're gonna try a little of each
so just Phil and I are gonna try these but
we have little toothpicks to eat them with
we don't have to use our hands now the problem
with this little dish I don't know which is
which I'm just gonna guess I'm thinking this
might be octopus it's Joey and there's like
little pieces of octopus in it kind of like
a beignet this is much more like doughy or
kind of creamier reminds me a little bit of
sweet corn and wet the pork creamed corn yeah
now I'm gonna try the pork I hope I don't
eat two octopuses on accident I'm thinking
this is pork
I like the octopus the best too octopus is
the winner the pork I think much more subtle
flavors a little too subtle for me the octopus
is the winner let's see what Phil thinks hi
oh I can tell just by poking it that it's
a lot softer and looser than I expected very
interesting consistency the sauce tastes just
like barbecue sauce to me what's good it's
like a very unique spin on barbecue sauce
though more tang it's like kind of sour I
try the other one yeah this is uh my favorite
thing of the night so far actually and it's
not even Filipino food it is Japanese food
but very delicious I'm Blown Away by the texture
in there the kids are dying for some smoothies
and we've seen so many smoothie stands around
here but they pick one in particular that
they want to get something from peanut butter
banana peanut butter banana strawberry banana
I got the mango because I am obsessed with
the mangoes in the Philippines they are so
good oh my gosh it tastes like you're just
biting into one of their mangoes it's so good
still stole my drink thank you I love it brain
freeze mine tastes like strawberry and vanilla
all right I'm still in search of these amazing
dishes though so we've got to keep looking
we found something really special in Cordova
which is a smaller island off of Mactan which
is
which is City and to a backdrop of really
bad karaoke music we're here at n toys bakassion
this is a legendary place that really put
this entire area of Cebu on the map a few
years ago and the founder owner who unfortunately
died in 2020 is featured in that same episode
of street food Asia and he's famous for taking
sea eels which prior to him were considered
non-edible and turning them into a very famous
dish which is the sea eel soup or wreath eel
soup and we're gonna try it today because
it sounds phenomenal hi are you open we would
love to try the famous three steel soup this
is antoi's famous eel soup and we have no
utensils because we're supposed to sip it
and then use our fingers to eat the eel you
want the first soap first I thought it was
octopus second I thought it was a snake and
then you said it was an eel and I was like
what all right it has a lot of health benefits
it makes you healthy but I could not get the
story because they don't speak English I don't
speak their language so I couldn't get all
the information I was looking for soup is
delicious it's very brothy like a miso soup
but there's a little bit more of like a sweet
soy maybe flavor to it I love it and now here's
the adventurous part the eel eating okay it's
like just like you can come on perspective
that was not your bones in there only thing
is they have bones in it so there is a spine
in the eel the texture is not my favorite
but uh the The Taste is similar to a calamari
if the calamari was much softer because it
can be kind of tough and cook it really good
I think I can help out with the nutrition
issue first of all it's soup you know so it's
got Seafood in here it has vegetables in here
that broth alone is gonna have kind of medicinal
nutritional qualities but one of the things
that is best known for is it's aphrodisiac
effect so I don't know if you feel that kicking
in yet babe but uh let's give this a try I
gotta I'm playing catch up very oniony and
uh oh you know what celery celery I see celery
in here and so that makes sense you get kind
of that peppery celery flavor oh it's much
more pungent than a miso in my opinion uh
and by the way eels look like snakes they
are not snakes all they are is long fish so
it makes sense that they wouldn't be pulling
the bones out of here or anything because
it's hard to debone something that is a size
basically of a sardine right and uh I believe
that's his little snout right there and then
this would be the tail I'm gonna start with
the tail
you can kind of beat around the bones on the
top and the bottom I've seen people just eat
these entire things whole but I don't know
how you're doing that with the bones check
my style out peeling that bad boy right off
his spine now we're cooking with bacon well
you see yeah refill no bones it looks delicious
and really good like full of lots of flavor
as good as that soup was and as fulfilling
as it is to actually finally make it here
after seeing this place on television and
learning so much about the founder I'm still
not satisfied and I don't know if that's just
because of the aphrodisiac effect but we need
to hit the road and find some of the other
things on my list let's go first I think Phil
and I need some alone time foreign [Music]
Street and it's a busy street in Cebu City
it's named after christable cologne who's
also known as Christopher Columbus I want
to thank everybody who commented on our Manila
episode and let us know that the Philippines
has the longest Christmas season in the world
it starts from September until January 1st
a full three months of Christmas time I see
no problem with Cebu City is the oldest city
in all of the Philippines and it's basically
the birthplace of the Philippines as we know
it today it started off as a major trade for
it still is a major trade for but during their
initial stages of growth they gave rise to
the big street food culture which is still
an integral part of the culture today it's
extremely important considering the fact that
about a quarter of the population here doesn't
even have an oven or a stove to cook hot meals
at home and I think we just found one of the
key things on my list today so let's check
it out foreign
it's the Filipino version of chicharron so
it is fried pork intestines and it's supposed
to be crispy and chewy and paired with some
vinegar yeah crispy and chewy in the middle
it tastes like it has a little meat to it
but that's not me now Colt's gonna try the
bubua there's pork meat in here it's like
a very sugary and hard maple if there's sugar
and carb meatball all right very much like
a meatball I'd say there's lots of bread in
there it's breaded inside very similar to
a meatball but that pork flavor makes it kind
of smoother taste with the pork than a beef
it's good I like this too two for two [Music]
keeps eating it honestly tastes like if you
went to Kentucky Fried Chicken and got the
pieces that are just fried skin because they
fell off the chicken really good now they
don't have fish balls here but they have basically
the same thing in a different shade fish fingers
I would call these These are deep fried unlike
the fish balls we just had at the hawker stalls
in Singapore these are going to be crunchy
on the outside almost identical texture to
the ones we had in Singapore in our soup meaning
it's very dense it's really good this one's
drier than what was in the soup in Singapore
which would make sense I'm gonna dip it in
the vinegar
very good our list is still far from done
so we got to keep searching all day let's
go we're to open public market and honestly
I'm getting a little bit tired of trying to
find all of these little dishes on my own
so this time we've hooked up with a local
expert local June he's gonna be our guide
and he's going to help us knock the last few
items off of our list June is our taxi driver
and he wants us to give a shout out to all
his other driving friends OCTA boys and Quest
Falcon hello hi all right starting off here
with quack quack which is hard-boiled quail
eggs and then they are breaded in an orange
breading and deep fried so they're really
crunchy on the outside three and a little
baby first I want to say how nice everybody
is everyone in the Philippines is so kind
we love it here now I got the spicy sauce
because we all know I like spikes
I love that sauce that sauce is awesome this
is delicious I really love it it is a dough
built in to the hard-boiled quail eggs look
you can see the middle of it there
oh she likes it I'm so proud of you she wants
to take it off this thing I'm so proud of
her all right Colt wants to try the spicy
yeah like yum who knew quack quack it's our
Jam you need to try it another spicy sauce
how interesting it's like the inside of a
hard-boiled egg that's delicious that's way
better than fair food stuff we have fried
yeah interesting so I just want to make it
orange so they use food coloring
head to toe I love not just that we're here
trying the food but then we get to see this
community
it's our golden ticket we should have done
this from the very beginning because this
is exactly what we were looking for the entire
time and what we look for every time we travel
this is the local perspective for sure and
this is the kind of exposure I want our kids
to have with the world I want them to see
the communities and the everyday people and
how similar and different people live their
lives and different countries wherever we
go to put some of these costs in perspective
what we just bought from that pastry shop
those were six pesos per item 100 pesos is
about a dollar sixty nine so the two of those
would be about 17 cents combined seven pesos
this is chicken skin essentially fried up
and then the sauce super crunchy so this is
just really really crunchy it's exactly what
you would expect of having just like the the
fried skins
that's really good so some of these are side
dishes there's salted shrimp salted fish dried
fish some things they use in everyday cooking
thank you we got some sweet grilled bananas
it's starting to rain a little bit but that's
not gonna slow us down the kids are gonna
love this because it's covered in sugar and
yeah
let caramel and then it sticks to your teeth
just like a coffee or caramel whip then the
inside is really hot I'm glad we're under
this umbrella though because now it's starting
to pour we are waiting for the taxi driver
to come it's good timing with the rain because
June just went to go get the car he's gonna
take us to another location that is covered
so we're gonna have the rest of the bites
covered out of the rain
no she doesn't that would make us stick out
like sore thumbs and then everybody would
know that we're not from here actually we
are the only westerners here in this area
[Music]
soup number five soup number five all right
this one's been to the top of my list they
say that if you mention this soup blanch out
to the locals they'll kind of give you a little
smirk because this is the equivalent of what
we in Colorado have we call uh Rocky Mountain
Oysters but it's a soup with some very special
ingredients thank you I'm about to eat a bowl
of dicks June advised me to squeeze some uh
lime on there so I did Stir It Up a little
bit so I'm looking forward to my increased
energy and libido from the aphrodisiac effects
from this soup that has cow and horse testicles
and penis and and ginger and butter and everything
here we go
I can't imagine anything chewier than that
it's like a gum yeah
I think I'm just gonna have to swallow that
all right and then we think this one is skin
much less chewy much easier to eat and the
broth is fantastic it's a thick broth like
a beef stew kind of flavor and consistency
uh this is like horse and cow penis and balls
you want to try it either
in this entire country I've been anticipating
eating more very good broth it's almost like
a gravy it's kind of thick and salty flavorful
yeah it's like a sweet and sour consistency
I got something very unique and different
I had never heard of this before but I'm gonna
try it now and I'm not gonna tell you what
it is until after I have a taste it's good
it's chicken blood so if they it's boiled
seasoned and then Frozen chilled until it
becomes more of a solid then they cut it up
and they Grill it before you eat it I'm I
can't tell you how this is delicious it is
a bizarre thing for us from the US to imagine
eating but it's really good and they eat this
food because they have the animal and they
have to use it if you 
use all of it the best way that they can to
make the most food that they can it's a really
cheap way to feed people and give them a lot
of nutrients well tell me what you think of
that oh cool it's good it is delicious okay
this is the ultimate this is balut scary I'm
intimidated I'm nervous but June tells me
it's delicious this is basically a half baked
or 90 percent baked duck egg fertilized duck
egg there is a baby duck in here it's a duck
embryo inside of this egg first thing I do
is tap the top off all right peel the top
off will there be feathers in this June yes
there are feathers in this I already see them
I think you open it big so on our balloon
I am peeling away the top chunk of the shell
here all right a little bit of salt on top
a little bit of vinegar oh drink
another remove the skin yeah yeah because
it has a duck maybe Duck in it I eat this
all at once yeah [Music]
[Music]
almost choking on a baby duck
when I thought eating wings was messy it's
hard to describe something that is unlike
anything else you've ever eaten in your entire
life hard-boiled egg but much more firm and
so much more flavor I had heard that maybe
it had some chicken flavor or a poultry flavor
in there honestly I don't get any of that
if anything maybe some hints of beef but of
course I get a lot of salt and vinegar because
we put so much of that on top the first time
in the millionaire because
you're trying it too yes wow [Music] okay
can I have the salt right here honey can I
have a napkin yeah no it's okay
no oh my Lord Brooklyn Ray you are awesome
look it's not like real dots like where you
just bite into it you bite into it so proud
of these kids for trying something so incredibly
new but Luke did not originate in the Philippines
they observed uh travelers from China eating
it and then they have their own take on it
you can do this yeah more vinegar this has
turned into a really incredible experience
for the whole family and it was unexpected
it was impromptu there was no way we could
have mapped this whole thing out and we're
so grateful to you June for taking us to these
last places and showing us around and really
giving us an eye-opening experience we have
more travel to do so please keep watching
us we love your support we love you thank
you thank you thank you we're gonna head back
to the hotel.
With each new community and culture we encounter
in our world travels we look for ways to leave
it better than we found it sometimes that
can be as simple as picking up trash on a
local Beach or buying goods from locals without
bartering for a lower price other times we
roll up our sleeves and help serve those in
need like this time but when some of our viewers
started sending a super thanks money through
YouTube this month we were touched and we
were inspired to pass that money right back
to the communities that are featured in our
content as our Channel grows these gifts could
start to have a real impact on the vibrant
people they support for this episode you can
give to a great Philippines charity just by
clicking the thanks button below and making
your gift 100 of our proceeds will go directly
to the charity to learn more about that charity
and this brand new program of ours go to follow
abc.com give and thank you thank you
first okay I almost ate it wrong
