rome italy
a city
known for its rich history
stunning architecture and famous
attractions like the colosseum
the pantheon
and the trevi fountain
[Music]
it is also next to the smallest country
in the world

[Applause]
home of the pope
and the majestic saint peter's basilica
and the sistine chapel
[Music]
so what does a white american tourist
from nashville tennessee seek out
you guessed it
filipino food
according to recent estimates there are
anywhere from 108 000 to 150 000
filipinos in rome
it is also home to filipino restaurants
it even has a jollibee
during our search we found a place
called neighborhood restaurant
they serve authentic filipino and
kapampangan cuisine it is located just a
few fall from vatican city
in this episode we will see jonathan
from nashville try out the different
flavors of neighborhood
all right for our first dish uh what do
we have jonathan
uh freshman pia yep lupian
so
he's putting in
some of the peanut sauce
all right so here we go
i should probably be using the spoon to
cut mine uh
no you use your fork
you guys don't use knives do you
usually not but that's okay
let's do it the correct way
wow he's actually using a
spoon
very filipino
what do you think
all right we got a thumbs up for the
first step
all right dig in
[Music]
[Applause]
hey jonathan uh where are you from
okay and this is your first time here in
rome of course
okay and being in rome what made you uh
come find filipino food
well i love filipino food i'm always
trying to cook it and
trying different filipino restaurants
all right thank you jonathan
[Music]
all right next we have fun sit
all right it looks like
mixed together
and we have garlic fried rice
all right
go ahead and grab the garlic fried rice
okay
it looks like we have more dishes coming
here hello
all right
[Music]
all right all right so let's see if i
like this i normally
let's see how this is
[Music]
it's probably hard to find it here in
rome
but they have the lemon
yeah jonathan looks like a pro
all right looks like we got a few thumbs
bryce in here
looks like you have your own routine
trying to get all the goodness out of
that ball
[Music]
i wanna see what the bronze tastes like
really good i prefer mine a little bit
more sour but that's really good
all right let's go ahead
this is there
[Music]
so basically this is uh what we do with
leftover liquid
we put it in the marker
and then let it simmer there for
uh i think a few hours i don't really
know
i just eat it
all right
all right now it's time for dessert we
have our famous
or mix mix
let's mix it basically we have ice cream
we have metropolitan top
and some goodies mystery ingredients in
the bottom
but i wish sometimes these would come in
a larger class
i'm not sure if there's a different
technique to this but
you should try the electric line and see
how it goes
what do you think
they're both really good
all right i think i finally
got it mixed pretty good without making
too big of a mess on the table but here
we go
each spoonful
check out neighborhood
here in rome
the atmosphere is great and the food's
even better
