manila big and dense you blink and you get lost 
in the crowd choking the pollution or get drunk by  
the constant nagging most travelers use money as a 
jump off point to the paradise islands but are you  
missing out we made it to the concrete jungle of 
manila full of skyscrapers and shopping paradises  
a home to 20 million people when a melting pot of 
water so for manila full of goodness and craziness  
but food and history is what brought us here 
and there's no better place for us to take you  
than intramurals or holy week today is a 
big day for the filipinos it's holy week  
and the world city streets are closed for vehicles 
so many people have come here to enjoy its beauty  
right now we are here in san agustin church 
and we're here to share the joys with you
it's the oldest church in the philippines 
built in the 16th century by the spanish  
it's a roman catholic baroque style 
church and now protected by unesco
this is intramuros also known as the wood city of 
manila it lies on the south bank of pacific river  
and was built in 1571 by miguel lopez de la gaspi 
the wood city is bound by moats on those sides  
and thick high walls some over six meters 
high the district was originally a home  
to indianized malayan islamic settlement but 
became the center of religious political and  
military power in the 16th century when 
the country was under control of spain
only the elite spaniards were allowed 
accommodation here in intramurals and today  
intramurals is the only district in 
manila that has kept its own spanish  
looks the historic buildings here remain as a 
reminder of the philippines challenging past  
and you can now get a glimpse of the 
glory walking down the cobot street
and just outside the walls the daily 
life of the filipinos continues with  
all the hustle bustle and craziness it's a super 
hot day today and colleen's giving it so i see  
these fresh lemonades everywhere we are gonna 
try it looks so good guys i can't even explain to  
you how hot it is here today i keep walking past 
these lemonade stands looking okay it's now time
wow that's incredible that is so  
oh good quite sweet as everything is here but 
that's so refreshing that's calling me down for  
a little bit more filming i can do now it's all 
good if manila had a saw you would find it hiding  
into the ancient buildings the capital was built 
over 450 years ago and survives multiple invasions  
a world war and even a bomb of overdevelopment 
walking past some of these buildings is like  
walking into a time machine some 
of these buildings is fort santiago
we've just grown up to grow up to venice grand 
canal mall it's meant to be like a little italy  
and half this river in inside a mall outside the 
mall and these gondolas which are like traditional  
italian boats it sounds really interesting i'm 
looking forward to this one because this baroque  
style and a lot of ornaments it doesn't look like 
a shopping center at first it's very very pretty
there's plenty of options in manila for a 
bit of retail therapy they've got some of  
the largest malls in the world but this one 
for me is a bit boutiquey clothes shops bit  
of kind of boutiques perfume shot this one is 
more about western style franchise food outlets  
with some really cool alfresco dining 
if you like us guys and you absolutely  
love shopping no no no don't listen to you we 
we completely dislike shopping yeah we're not  
big shopping fans but but this is the place 
to come it's the second biggest mall in asia  
it's the biggest mall in the philippines yeah 
so well we've we've come here for one reason  
and one reason only because just before we 
left to come to the philippines this happened
so now we've got to go shopping so we can 
find a new drone so when we get back to  
the islands which let's be fair we love the 
islands we can show you guys some amazing  
footage i'm pretty sure everyone loves 
a bird eye so let's go find a joint guys
for someone that didn't like shopping 
she's not doing too bad i know this guy  
feels if i carry on she'll be much longer me 
and him are going to go out together tonight  
quick update guys still not without a drone yet  
or a shop that sells them so hopefully we 
can find one but the food court up here  
is incredible so let's get ourselves 
some good food come on let's go
guys it's incredible um we've gone for the 
ramen so i've gone for the the black garlic  
i think it's like pork and some egg the sauce is 
really really rich you can get the garlic but it's  
really meaty as well wow that looks exciting very 
yummy actually to be very honest with you i don't  
know what i'm having all i asked for is what's 
the chef's recommendation and they said go for  
tan tan man i'm not sure what it is so i'm just 
going to try it wow we have a soulful spoon here
this is an infusion and flavors it's so delicious 
i think there's some meat i think it's food pork  
there's some noodles the the the 
sauce is very very very delicious  
so they have got one here ideally i don't want 
the combo because i already got the batteries  
from the last disaster that i had so let's 
go and find out if they've got the normal one
