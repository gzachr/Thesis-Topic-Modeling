 Good day!
 Good day Mommy!
 You're next to our cow siblings!
 Today we are going to cook Bulalo-Nilaga!
 I thought Bulalo and Nilaga were separate dishes?
 Bulalo is beef shank!
Is that what it is?
 That's beef shank right?
 This one is beef short ribs!
 This is typically for nilaga.
 What is the difference between bulalo and nilaga?
 For those asking?
 Bulalo is with beef shank
 with pepper and lots of onions.
 The main thing is the soup and the marrow.
 Right. Yes!
 What is nilaga?
 Nilaga is
there's lots of vegetables.
Lots of different site ingredients that you can choose from
so that we can all be full.
 We're going to do a combination!
 So that we can be really healthy.
 OK let's start!
 We are going to open our beef.
 And we're going to wash them.
 Then afterwards I will show you the other ingredients.
Is that good with you?
 Good!
 He said it's good.
 I start washing our beef.
 We will put the beef straight to our pot.
 So that we can directly put it in the stove.
It's important to wash it so you can get rid of any excess dirt.
 OK.
 There.
 Just scrub them clean.
 It's not that dirty anyway.
 That looks different from what you put before.
 We had the beef shank and short ribs here.
 What's that?
 It's the beef shanks siblings.
 Oh, it's beef shank cut and half.
 Let's now put water,
 We're just going to cover the beef so they can cook all together.
 Let's not put it on high.
 We will wait for it to boil for about 1 to 2 hours.
 Up until it's all cooked and tender.
 Then halfway through we will put all of the ingredients.
 Ma, I'm seeing all the comments right now,
 "Why are you not using a pressure cooker, it's easier?!"
 I don't like using the pressure cooker because it's much more flavorful,
 the beef taste different
 if you slowly cook it on the stove.
 But if you want to use a pressure cooker to make it easier,
 just make sure to add more flavorings.
 It's all up to your taste buds like I say.
 While were waiting for the beef to cook,
 I will show you the rest of our ingredients.
 OK?
 Bok choy.
 Cabbage.
 Potatoes.
 Sweet potato (white japanese yams).
 Carrots.
 Two whole onions.
 Red and white for more flavor.
 Sugar.
 Salt.
 Whole black pepper corn.
 And of course knorr beef cubes.
We're not using the powder I usually use because the powder is chicken not beef.
 That's why we are using beef boullion.
 Tip!
 I don't have any tips today.
 I just really like hearing the ding ding ding ding ding.
 I just thought of something.
 Tip!
 You can use chicken,
 or pork,
 if you don't have any beef.
 That's OK to use but it's not as flavorful.
Beef is just more flavorful in general by itself.
 We're going to wait for a bit more.
Look at my earrings, isn't it beautiful? 
 You will get hungry.
 Dumplings.
 What kind of them places that?
 I don't even know what it is.
Yes, what about the other one what is that.
 What is that?
 Christmas tree?
Since Christmas is approaching.
 Think of what kind of dishes if you want me to cook
 Comment down below.
So you can see what kind of special dishes we can eat before Christmas and New Year's.
 Why did it double I only left her 40 minutes?
 I was waiting for it to cook, what happened?
 It was overflowing.
 So we're going to cook two pots?
 What else?
 I'm not gonna be able to put my vegetable.
 We're going to put the whole peppercorns.
 We're going to begin flavoring it.
 There you go.
 Of course our onions.
Let's stir it a bit.
 Let's just check if it's sticking in the bottom.
 But it's OK so far.
 Let's put a bit of salt.
 About 1 teaspoon.
 Let's add more flavoring later before it cooks.
You're probably wondering why we put our onions and pepper corn halfway through.
Because I want to be to be a bit tender
 and I want beef flavor in the soup
the onion flavor will be absorbed easily through the beef
 and spices.
 Let's leave it alone again.
 Let it simmer for a bit more.
 One more hour because it still throw the beef like stone.
 The other one we're cooking is reserved.
 So when the other one runs out,
 we can just transfer it there.
 The other one has a lot of soup anyway.
 We just always have to find a way, our plan a
the beef was overflowing, we have plan b.
 Here they are.
 Is that good?
 It's been 30 minutes since we put the onions and pepper corn.
 We will put our two beef bouillion.
 Let's put our potatoes.
 Carrots.
 Sweet potatoes.
 Let's put our sugar
 You already know why.
 So that our soup has a bit of sweetness.
Can you put about 1 tablespoon of sugar.
We will close the lid and wait about another 15 minutes.
 Then we will put our last ingredient,
 the cabbage and bok choy.
 Look at my pot.
 You're wondering why is it like that huh?
 You know,
 that is from Dubai when I went there.
 Do you know where I put it?
 In my suitcase.
 I put a bunch of my shirt to cover it up.
 It got through here.
 The pot is returning to the country.
 Usually the pot is used for biryani
they put lots of chicken on top.
 But I use this pot to cook and tenderize meat.
 Because it's easy to cook with because it's thin.
 Hold on mom!
 What?!
 Say tip.
 Tip!
The reserved beef can be used for porridge!
 Just add onions and ginger, it's porridge!
 Porridge King. (local restaurant)
 Hour and 15 minutes and now done.
 The carrots, potatoes, and sweet potatoes are tender.
 We will now put our greens.
 OK.
 Let's put the cabbage on top.
 I'm not going to put all of it yet.
 Our bok choy.
 Let's close the lid until it cooks.
 We only have to cook it half cooked.
 It's not really good if it's too overcooked.
 It will be soggy.
 Let's wait for it to cook for just five minutes.
 We will be eating.
 I didn't put all the vegetables yet.
 We can use it as a reserve for our other pot of beef.
 We can always cook more when vegetables have run out.
 So that it will not get soggy altogether.
What are you putting Mom? 
 Oops sorry.
 I'm really sorry.
 I asked my son-in-law to run and get some corn
 Because I forgot.
 I knew it.
 Do you guys know when you were recording,
 I told my mom we were missing something.
 Typically you put it with the beef.
 Before you put the carrots, sweet potatoes, and potatoes.
 Don't worry, we always find away, I've boiled it with the reserved beef.
 There.
 But we will still be happy eating that even though
Even if it's last and good, you can still catch-up!
Here is our bulalo-nilaga.
 We achieved it.
 OK I'm going to sit down and eat.
 But before that,
 Look at our dipping sauce.
 Lemon with lots of chili, and fish sauce.
 Let's get corn.
 Some carrots.
Sweet potato.
 We will try all of it.
 And potato.
 Of course the beef shank.
 There.
 The bok choy already came with it.
 A bit of cabbage.
We need to try our dish. 
 Look how tender our beef is.
 Let's taste it.
 After this I'm going to sleep.
 One more taste, but I need to put some sauce.
 So it's complete.
 So soft.
 The meat is really tender.
 And our vegetables.
 Let's try the corn with the fish sauce.
 So sweet with a bit of spiciness.
 Take a look,
 We had to pay so many trials and tribulations.
 My pot overflowing,
 we forgot the corn,
But in life we need to face our struggles,
 like the struggles of our cooking.
 Don't forget!
