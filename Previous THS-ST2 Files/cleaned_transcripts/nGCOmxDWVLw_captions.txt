thank you [Music] [Applause] [Music]
what's going on everybody this island Hopper 
TV coming to you from Coron town here in the  
Philippines this is palawan's second most famous 
island maybe the most famous depending on what  
you like we're starting out here at the market 
we're actually doing some island hopping today  
all right so today we're going island hopping out 
to Coron Island from Coron Town Port out here  
you will see  Kayangan Lake, Twin Lagoon, Barracuda 
Lagoon maybe do some snorkeling. hello sir  
how are you? all right. travel time is 15 
to 20 minutes. and we're off
so we're here in  Kayangan Lake this is 
actually an area you can walk up and  
get nice views as well but yeah look at this place
[Music]
yeah the boat ride out here took 
about 15 minutes and once you're  
here you walk across this wooden plank and 
then you walk up some stairs to a amazing  
Viewpoint and then you go down the other 
side towards the lake where you can swim
[Music] fresh water 30 salt 
water here on this Lake
[Music]
we stayed here for about an hour and 
swam in the lake for a half hour and  
then we headed back they don't really 
sell much food out here but they do  
have some snacks like coconuts and deep 
fried banana [Music] [Applause] [Music]  
most people consider Kayangan Lake to be the 
best activity to do while here in Coron although  
I would say that's because of the Viewpoint more 
so than the lake with the view of the Lagoon here  
and we're actually headed to what I consider 
to be the better Lake this is Barracuda Lake  
and the boat ride takes around 10 to 15 minutes 
to get there it's very Scenic as you can see  
and the reason they call them Lakes 
is because it is 70 salt water and 30  
percent fresh water and it's in the 
actual Island not here on the ocean
[Music]
now depending on the time of year you arrive 
in Coron there may be many boats in this area  
in this case we were here in September this 
is actually off season it's not peak season  
but you can see there was still too many 
boats so we had to actually walk across  
another boat to get to the dock the walk out 
to the lake from the dock is actually quite  
interesting you can see it winds through this 
rock formation and then you arrive at the lake  
here where they have some deep cliff diving 
so if you like free diving this is your spot  
okay so we're gonna go check out this 
Cliff right here and see what's down there
and you can contact our guy here when 
you're in Coron hello if you want to  
experience uh this kind of travel 
so hope in the experience travels  
for travel and tours so it's 
amazing here for us thank you
hello
what do you have there sir
is that seafood seafood yeah
oh my God so cool
one thing that may be interesting to you is they 
do have these floating house hotels you can stay  
at look them up on Google [Music] foreign 
[Music]Here we are at Twin Lagoon we're gonna do some kayaking  
and go from the first Lagoon to the second 
Lagoon but you can see very beautiful in here  
and they have some pretty diving down there 
in between let's see what's out here [Music]  
for me personally I found the twin Lagoon 
to be one of my favorite activities above  
the Lakes even so if you guys like lagoons 
this is the spot to do some kayaking be sure  
to get one of those see-through kayaks while 
here because it's really awesome experience  
[Music]  
you want to walk across the stairs instead 
of paddle underneath [Music] foreign [Music]
but I have no money on me sir 
it's good it's a good boat  
yeah your boat made of Styrofoam huh and 
bamboo Pearl or loss nice where's the beer sir
oh very good sir Gotta Wear a life jackets 
mandatory so yeah I don't even think about  
asking why so each individual area 
has a different caretaker for the  
island and there's different environmental 
fees that you have to pay to get into each  
place it ranges between 150 pesos to 
200 pesos per person but most of these  
places their caretakers require you to 
wear the life jacket this is beautiful
[Music]
foreign
Island this one's called banol Beach [Music]
now let's talk about Coron things to do while 
here so you can do mostly  Kayangan Lake you can  
do twin Lagoon and you can do Barracuda Lagoon 
very easily within the same trip we're also at  
a beach here there's three different one there's 
Smith Beach manual Beach and then there's another  
one just over the way it's on the other side of 
prawn Island so you can do beaches after you do  
the lagoons and the lakes and get a Viewpoint 
so really a lot to do here just on the island  
hopping tour if you go towards the South part 
of the island or the East part of the island  
you'll also find other activities such as a 
safari I take it back it's actually on the  
west side of the island so they have a safari 
with giraffes and zebras pretty cool right  
because this island right here really is just 
like an African savannah you know that Banul
Beach is a good place to have your lunch they 
don't actually cook out here so no restaurants  
you bring the food with you from Coron town that 
you buy at the market and your captain will cook  
it for you in most cases there's lunch here got 
some pork some chicken some rice yummy [Music]  
you can arrive by ferry from El Nido or you 
can actually arrive by ferry from Mindoro but  
the preferred method is flying into Busawanga 
airport which is really the main area of the  
island and you can fly into busawanga from El 
Nido you can also fly in from Puerto Princesa  
Manila, Cebu City so many different flights coming 
into the airport here it is a small airport and  
it is a prop plane but look at Cebu Pacific or 
Philippine Airlines as well as air swift those  
are three different airlines that fly right in 
here now when you're in the Philippines be ready  
to drink San Miguel Beer they also have red horse 
but I prefer San Miguel light it's a light beer  
it's perfect for a hot day yeah so here we are 
at Sunset Lagoon the reason they call it sunset  
Lagoon is because if you look straight that way 
you actually get the sunset but right behind me  
here is the Hidden Beach inside of a cave so 
we're gonna try and kayak in there [Music]
thank you
oh wow
never been here before
all right
where is this thing
[Music] super Beach
one of the big things that stands out as a 
difference between Coron and El Nido is I would  
say here in Coron things are just a little 
bit closer together on the island of Coron  
in particular whereas in El Nido it seems like 
you've got to go a long way to get to the island  
or islands and things are just kind 
of spread out you're on a boat kind  
of going all around quite a bit whereas 
here in Coron it seems like you're just  
one activity after another quite 
close five minute rides here and  
there so that's one of the things that I've 
found to be very convenient about Coron and  
seems like the legumes here are better we're 
actually going to do the El Nido video coming  
soon here so if you guys are interested in heading 
to El Nido definitely watch that I'll put the link  
below in the description and in the comments 
also check out our other Channel Island Hopper  
travel highlights which is more behind the scenes 
raw footage [Music] and here we are arriving at  
skeleton wreck this here is an old Chinese fishing 
vessel it's about five meters deep at its most  
shallow we'll see what's down here uh yeah this is 
a beach not interesting lots of snorkeling [Music]  
oh
[Music]  
foreign [Music]
thank you
no town this is Quran Town
what a place
so here's a bit of information about 
Coron town so it's not actually on the  
island of Coron it's on bushawango which is the 
bigger island in the area where the airport is
well here in Coron Town don't expect too much 
nightlife for any real excitement like that  
it's really just a dive Outpost where you can get 
equipment and gear very minimally they don't have  
much here they have a few massage areas some 
restaurants but that's about it [Music] hello
[Music]
thank you
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
and as I was cruising around here I 
noticed that they had some Tick-Tock  
activities but really it's aerobic people 
are staying active using music it's just  
common all across the Philippines but they're 
definitely doing this out here in Coron town  
and on that note that's going to conclude this 
episode of Island Hopper TV from Coron see you

other videos from Philippines by clicking
