good afternoon everybody Welcome to a new episode 
here in the Philippines and today we're here in  
this area called Marikina I think it's called 
Marikina hopefully I'm not pronouncing it wrong  
but uh yeah welcome to Marikina today it's a 
super hot day anyway just then we talk around a 30  
minutes drive from BGC to here and we've arrived 
to this brand new area that I've never been  
before my first impression of this area when I was 
driving here is that the buildings are relatively  
short I guess it kind of reminds me of Thailand in 
a way because Thailand uh or say like areas in  
Phuket the places the buildings are relatively 
like two stories or three-story store and this  
um intersection it's a rather busy intersession 
as well anyway today we're on a mission because  
today we're here to meet a new friend uh one 
of our subscribers actually reached out to me  
his name is Rick and he said he's going to tour us 
around marikini Marikina don't know why I couldn't  
pronounce his name correctly Marikina but here 
we're at I guess this is one of the landmarks  
there's a big clock here with lots of bells I 
think this is called Marikina Park anyway let's  
final friends I believe maybe he's just 
somewhere around here he said he's around  
the park already Fountain I think uh we 
did mention we're gonna wait in front of  
the fountain so I think he's just around you 
let me see where our our friend is today Rick
hey Rick all right that's uh Rick right there our 
new friend here in the Philippines hey man how are  
you nice meeting you you welcome to the city of 
Marikina is this your home yes home uh Hometown  
so uh actually the local Republic of Marikina 
Republic It's like a whole city on its own yeah  
so is it part of Manila oh yes it surprised of 
pepper right and that's actually a reason why  
they call it yeah because uh everything is in 
order yeah compared to the rest of the Metro  
so since it's quite different from the usual uh 
Castle bus of Manila right yeah I think the Bible  
is very different I feel like people here maybe 
a bit more chill yeah yeah Manila it's always  
a hustle and a puzzle always go and it tricycle 
looks different I mean I mean the Japanese looks  
different Yes actually the the GPS here are color 
coded so um each route has their own Colors oh  
that's really convenient because in Manila even 
now I still don't know how to catch one because  
it just looks so different and usually it's just 
written on the side yeah it's going yeah but this  
one is clear so it has a certain route yeah it's 
like a normal bus then basically that's awesome  
but actually they're starting to like modernize 
the you know that's awesome I heard in Manila  
they're trying to replace the Japanese as well 
so here in America yeah that's awesome so um
is it your first time with a blogger
oh that's awesome to tour around the city wow it's 
the first time so wow that's awesome so before who  
have you taught before here in the city mostly 
my friends yeah outside outside the Manila yeah  
uh for foreign Nationals you're the first one 
awesome I like to be the first sometimes yeah  
you have the exclusive that's awesome wait 
when you say the jeepneys are color-coded I  
thought it means like a chimney it's colored like 
actually um you can see the difference on the roof
[Music] so they have their own stations I see 
so so in terms of like getting clients like  
obviously the same color means the first 
one needs to get more customers first so  
oh I need to it doesn't matter you can get 
on any of them it doesn't matter what yeah  
um of course priority is the first one the first 
one right makes sense oh so nice meeting you I  
feel like we've been talking to come to here and 
because I'm going on a solo adventure and then  
Rick reach out to me it's like now is the time to 
go to Marikina okay what's our first stop today  
okay so uh right now we're actually here at the 
sports bar okay so this Sports Park um it's been  
built like the 1960s wow so this is quite old 
yeah right and actually this is the first um
Sports facility yeah uh that's that was 
built in the area during the time can we  
go in or it's not open today uh right now uh 
it's still close but yeah they are preparing  
it for the the national games will be held here 
in manic national game this year that's awesome  
Let's uh let's see how different it is in Marikina 
the wet Market is different to other web markets  
got coconut yampuko juice
wow this reminds me of a Hong Kong 
wet Market is exactly like this  
with our fresh fruits my mother when I was 
young she would bring me a round of places  
and uh bring me to Wet Market because not everyone 
it's uh I guess like grow up if you don't go  
to this kind of markets you'll get not very 
comfortable with it but if you grow up with this  
then yeah this is just everyday scene of where the 
locals buy the groceries yeah hello chicken wow
this is where they buy the squids hello is it yeah  
yeah I guess so local markets will always be 
cheaper than supermarkets in BGC that's the  
thing BGC there's not a lot of like this 
local wet markets so the prices usually  
are double yeah yeah I would say it's like 
well yeah lots of fresh seafood options yeah  
yeah this reminds me a company like Hong 
Kong it's exactly the same looks like this
I must confess though like um I think people in 
Australia they will never have seen this kind of  
scenery because usually these are all sold in 
supermarkets the prices are like very similar  
but this is only in Asia yeah so this is what 
you expect if you come here to the Philippines  
and you go to local market wet Market it's 
gonna be wet if that's why it's called wet  
market so here this is some cookies yeah are 
these like special cookies Philippines yeah
hello kamusta so this one's a fried shrimp shrimp  
wow amazing huh would you like to 
try I think I'm okay for now oh
I think I'm okay for now but yeah this looks 
really interesting fried shrimp and what are these  
ones this is the chicharron the the fat uh thank 
you pork right pork skin yeah [Music] [Applause]  
selling this on a bus when we're on the way to 
Baguio yeah yeah so this uh um they usually a joke  
with it yeah if you have like high blood pressure 
this would uh this is a cutie this will kill you  
yeah so they also have like dogs awesome puddings 
yeah yeah is this like a sesame pudding or  
something no this is like very interesting yeah 
everything here why do you think about that cheese  
pie you've got Buko pie here and they're like 
yeah like the custard something like the candy
like the powder have you tried this one yeah 
overrun yeah no okay so this is like a milk  
powder milk powder yeah interesting so it's 
made with milk but different flavors so they  
they usually uh have it in like the original milk 
flavor the cookies and cream so this one's like  
an Uber version I'm assuming pepper oh it's just a 
packaging it's just a packaging all right yep okay

hold this for me please okay only for 10 
pesos yeah that's awesome it's a cheese
and cheese
the thing about Philippines coins 
is that they all look the same so  
uh it's very hot yes thank you 
very much and here you go yeah
all right let's try this
so [Applause] in there just my appearance
just my appearance it sounds like a normal normal 
bread but let's try maybe the taste is different
oh there's a plain version that would be 
clever it's inside it's just too soft yeah  
it's cheese no it's plain oh wait those 
oh wait wait wait there is something here  
this one tastes like a plain 
actually let me try a second bite
actually slide to one side only so 
the other half don't have cheese yeah  
but it's kind of common it's kind of common 
in the picture you see this one's okay  
but yeah for five pesos all right let me try the 
other one I want to get a review of Hope let's see  
what's this on top actually and that is 
brown sugar what uh no it's like the the  
flower family okay right so the excess yeah okay
how was it
tastes like bread nice bread right how 
would you compare it with the other one
I think it tastes more or less the same actually 
they taste very similar but um they are really  
fresh bread so I like it I guess one thing 
we notice in Manila is that when we buy try  
to buy fresh fat like the ones from two Market 
they're not really fresh they're like the ones  
that they're very soft so like a sponge but these 
ones are fresh because you can feel the texture  
mmm tasty oh I see a cheese now is that cheese 
yeah see it's only on one side so if you find the  
right side and you might miss out the teeth that's 
why it's advisable to eat in the right person
I'm not full thank you how 
do you say have a good day um
yeah you're gonna say Parliament yeah 
interesting experience yeah even I a local  
one it's kind of hard to say right all right next 
destination let's go here first okay on this side  
all right so I think I'm gonna give 
a break for the GoPro first just to  
let it cool down so I'll see you guys 
when we arrive the next destination
200 pesos right what is this actually so this is 
the local dish of Marikina yes uh it's composed  
of uh only in Marikina yeah Everlasting yes this 
originated I like the name Everlasting it sounds  
interesting why can you keep it for a long time 
or Everlasting yeah you can just put it on your  
refrigerator so that's why the name you can keep 
it forever it's a kimchi you can just like slice  
um if you want to eat just like a meatloaf yeah 
meatloaf with boiled eggs I know at least I know  
two weeks two weeks refrigerator right interesting 
how they got the name Everlasting let's get  
Everlasting you can keep for like so long in six 
months Everlasting okay so you eat this with rice  
yeah have you had lunch yet uh not yet okay cool 
we'll share this one all right okay have a last  
day they use like a bubble tea wrap machine yeah 
to wrap the packaging it looks very interesting  
usually you save it here yeah [Music] oh today is 
not gonna you're gonna not gonna give me a break  
from eating it is it yeah just uh eat the bakery 
across the road I was like gonna see you guys in  
a bit and across the road and the break was like 
oh we're gonna try this place too yeah because  
they already have it this is the local delicacy 
all right always down to try Alina is missing out  
yeah next time she should be here yeah 
next time she should come to Marikina  
Marikina Marikina Marikina it's like a it's like 
tongue twister but maybe I'll keep practicing it  
alright so let's get this a try  
is it oh it's warm ready to repeated it 
yeah all right so two pick two two pick yeah
that's the one that's it thank you
all right so how do I stop eating this 
I'm getting start by slicing of course  
all right I'm Gonna Leave It uh 
where can I put it here yes yeah
it's nice oh yes wow it's like a 
birthday cake where's birthday song
I'm the birthday boy today
all right there you go so he passed racing 
hey raisins reasons oh that one yeah  
ah wow it's kind of um how much do you want 
um I'll just sliced my own okay like this yes  
wow like this oh size that makes sense 
makes sense yeah okay all right so we can  
have like pizza okay sounds good 
all right let's give this a try
wow it's like it is spicy  
not really not spicy okay but finally 
that one has like the tomato sauce
yeah it smells like tomato sauce
what was it
I like it you taste I like it dancing 
when it's good for you got a dance  
yes I see I mean it really makes you 
have the idea of the rice though now I  
see it will be overpowered but if we mix 
the rice there's five pixels yeah dig in  
I think that racing gives it a bit of 
extra sweetness into it so it makes a  
dish it's like a mix of salty and sweet but 
it's not too salty yeah so it's just right  
I think really delicious the texture 
is like a meatloaf right right yeah
okay she said that since it's 
freshly cooked still kind of soft  
but once you like put it on the chiller and  
okay let's get hotter yeah yeah it becomes 
like tastier and it's very tastier you said  
after refrigerated yeah so it's meant to be harder 
yeah I thought it's gonna be soft but it's really  
tasty all right let me try to eat with the egg 
let's see if uh it makes a big difference [Music]
all right just send that bite didn't 
have the Egg and I want to get a bit  
of everything so I've got a rice in here too  
really just randomly like uh sketch the 
the ingredients or is it like in a pattern
feelings feelings all right
every day
yep that's it just a mix of different texture 
that's why yeah I think all right it's a good fish  
something new in the Philippines because I'm 
having it it's like Christmas in your mouth  
Christmas in my mouth yeah hahaha that's right 
butterfly what a candle here can be a birthday  
cake but yeah overall tasty experience all 
right cool all right anyway now let's enjoy this  
because it's really delicious alright so we just 
finished the meal here this place actually called  
Cuisine which means the kitchen of twins because 
apparently uh they say their boss boss born to  
Twin and then they also have twin daughters so 
that's why it's like a family in DNA twins but  
yeah overall it was a good experience trying 
one of the local Delicacies here in Marikina  
okay now it's coming out naturally in my mouth 
you guys just now I keep pronouncing it wrong  
but yeah this place was visited by a lot of 
celebrities uh even TV shows at night okay I  
think right now I'm already oh that's the thing 
I actually got some takeaways here maybe for a  
later try basically the lady just sent was saying 
the ingredients of this is made of mostly meatloaf  
um and then there is tomato sauce and 
there is garlic and onion and there is
green pepper yeah capsicums maybe
uh not chili ones like yeah the green one 
yeah the green one so yeah Oprah is quite  
interesting experience I guess inside them 
I mean the meatloaf itself is tender and I  
think because it's meatloaf so it's 
already like processed meat so it's  
meant to last longer I guess that's also one of 
the names why it's called Everlasting as well  
all right what's the next 
destination captain as I said um
I forgot to tell you that to prepare to prepare 
your stomach okay prepare my stomach yeah that's  
it I was not ready to eat so much today yeah 
so we're here at Allen Remy which is since 9  
30 in one of the oldest stores here on the 
street and we're gonna eat some puto here  
all right so what would you recommend oh I got 
bitten by mosquito here God damn it yeah [Music]  
you can buy it on the big oh my goodness that's 
a lot yeah is it like a smaller one this one is
it on the other side
oh my goodness when I was young I ate this one 
wow traveling memories okay you found it here yeah  
wow I didn't expect this okay so remember I could 
demolish a whole box when I was young in one day
um okay so um
okay this one is the original then this one 
is like mixed with uh like the sticky foreign
which one is your favorite but this one is 
your favorite okay I'll get try this one then
sorry oh this different flavor um
okay right how much is this one okay all right 
I'll get one of these then let's try this this  
looks interesting I don't know if I can 
finish it but when I get home I can get  
Elena to try this as well I think would be quite 
an interesting experience but it's made of rice  
yeah wow lots of our desserts and fruit here in 
the Philippines are made with rice yeah all right  
that she's on top that's awesome so this original 
uh this one is original plain this original  
what's different between plain and original
well of course the plain one is like rice 
The Taste is like plain okay okay and then  
there's the original original one yeah 
right yeah with a bit of both sides and  
the Uber one and then that's the one 
with the sticky rice that's gonna be  
a very sticky meal gonna get like my 
Coca-Cola with me eat together okay  
all right thank you very much all right let's 
give this a try all right I'll hold this swap
that one's your favorite all right let's try 
this one first then it's uh quite like squishy
okay just come at the last one this one is more  
flavor it's a little bit sweet so 
it's nice but it's not overly sweet
quite nice again it's like a 
jelly kind of thing interesting
maybe I need some drinks actually 
oh is that always going to get a  
little bit too big actually I 
have got I've got two pictures
hold it for you oh yes please you're my assistant
all right next
one
see that's the thing all these um 
flavors have a very subtle taste
so it's not very strong you can taste a little 
bit of that flavor but it's not very strong
so I mean is the difference is I'm very subtle I 
would say for me that's still tasty I think Uber  
is actually more tasty than the last one I think 
because I like poopy in general all right this is  
um they say with sticky rice inside there is 
something here it's like Jackfruit no it's Jesus
whoa
this one has a very strong Taste of egg I don't 
know if they actually have egg inside but it's  
just strong it has an egg taste like boiled 
egg kind of taste so it's quite interesting  
I think um this one is better than the Uber 
one so it's one two three no one two three  
all right who knows me the flame 
one is most delicious let's see
hmm it's plain
but yeah it's a good snack I think um when 
you're hungry in the afternoon you can just  
eat this one yeah it's a good snack thank 
you yeah overall interesting delicacy yeah  
if you in this area then try this rice cake 
I would say yeah you want some no your turn
yeah which one is your favorite 
personally this one in this one  
these two but I haven't tried this 
one yet okay try this try this
what do you think it's like this one with a bit 
flavor yeah but I say the difference very subtle  
you know yeah it has Uber flavor but it's not 
that strong yeah so what's your order now [Music]  
wait let me remember let's see let's 
see if your reaction is the same as mine  
ah this is one one yeah yeah I think same 
for me that one's a one can you taste like  
extra egg text taste then the texture which was 
better compared I agree this one is more like um  
like a jelly kind of thing more chewy so it's more 
sticky all right yeah very um interesting delicacy  
yeah so I'm gonna like bring this home to uh let 
Alia try this as well and see what a reaction is  
all right thank you thank you see you next time
let's go back I'll go back
okay all right all right so a couple minutes walk 
from the place here with the rice cake we're now  
at this um Park area and there's a river what's 
the name of this River Marikina River right so  
um so Rick was actually telling me that there are 
lots of genitive fish right here and I was told  
that maybe the former one of the former mayors who 
uh they he tried to scattered the the eggs of um  
the janitor fish in this River that's why there's 
so many of them and at one point become a pest and  
there are also lots of birds dipping down I'm 
assuming they're trying to catch a fish if luck
you also mentioned this area it's where you hang 
out after school normally because I can see lots  
of teenagers here spending their time maybe 
having some picnic and you say morning there's  
Zumba session sometimes yeah very interesting oh 
it's it what are they doing cuando Taekwondo they  
look like they're dancing they're practicing 
yeah many people in the Philippines are like  
Dancing Yeah is it for tick tock or it's just 
like the culture fencing some of them tick tock  
all right so now we're taking a tricycle to try 
the next stage which is okay all right oh you  
said vice behind the seat yeah there's another one 
okay what's this yeah let's try that one all right
all right it's interesting on the side 
that's quite interesting hopefully I  
don't fall off later there's a handle right
