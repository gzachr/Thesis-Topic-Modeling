and the word railway station is
jealous
i'm so good no not at all hi guys
welcome back to my channel in this video
i'm going to be talking about
why slovak language is so difficult to
learn
a few weeks back i uploaded a video
about my progress in slovak language and
a lot of you have sent me messages and
comments
how good is my slovak language so far
and even my accent is so good
which i don't entirely agree
but i really appreciate all your
beautiful comments so thank you so much
guys from from the bottom of my heart
so in this video as i have said i'm
going to talk about some of the reasons
why i think slovak is a really hard
language
word i mean you may not agree with my
reasons or maybe
let's say excuses but this is totally
based on my
experience while i am learning passively
the language for maybe about a year now
or more than a year now and i just
wanted to mention also
that how i agree with you guys that
if you're living in bratislava it's not
actually necessary to
learn the slovak language because
there's already a lot of foreigners here
who are working in international
companies
also there are a lot of slovak um the
young slovaks who are already
fluent in english they can speak english
so well so it's not really necessary to
learn
the slovak language however in my
opinion
which maybe you will not agree but it's
totally fine i respect and understand
that
but for me if you are planning to live
in a foreign country for a decent amount
of time then
it's kind of appreciated to make an
effort
and learn the local language in this way
you can better integrate yourself
into the local community rather than
isolating yourself just because you
don't
understand or speak their language or
maybe expecting them to adjust on your
way
and expect them to speak on your
language i think it's a lot better if we
as a foreigners will make an effort to
learn the language and try to
communicate with the locals
in this way we can build a more
harmonious relationship and really
understand the local culture
i know this because back in the
philippines we really love foreigners
who are trying to speak tagalog to us
even though we can speak english to them
it's just that it makes us feel so much
special and knowing that they want to be
part of us
anyways that being said let me share
with you guys
my excuses why i still haven't mastered
the slovak language first the
diacritical marks of the slovak alphabet
the first reason why slovak language is
such a difficult language to learn from
me
is because of the diet critical marks of
the language
diacritical marks are those small signs
that you can find
on the slovak alphabet that indicates
the length
and how you should pronounce each
letters or alphabet
for example i call this the apostrophe
on top of
the letters like there's the ah
e
so this letter is kind of indicates that
you should pronounce it
longer than the normal letters
and it's so easy to say but so hard to
practice
so like for example the normal a we
would say mama
but the elongated a would sound
yamam ano
i am sure that some of the slovak words
in this video i will not be able to
pronounce
properly so sorry in advance but i'm
still practicing on my pronunciation
and this is really important because
sometimes
the spelling is the same but the
pronunciation is totally different and
if you pronounce it wrong
it may change the whole meaning of the
sentence
like for example um you would say rad
which is something like like and you can
say
rad which is something like q alright
the second reason
is softening the sound of the syllables
or
the letters this is when slovak language
starts to be really tricky for me in
slovak language
they have another marks as if they don't
have a lot of marks in their letters
they have another mark which i which
they call it
um palatalization mark but it for me i
call it
wings and for slovak they call it marc
chen
something like that so for example there
is the
cha
cha there's a
liar let's take for example the word
delgava
i don't know if i pronounce that
accurately
i'm not really really sure but let's
just take for example the word de liava
which
means to the left so if it's a normal
spelling l i would just pronounce it the
lava
very easily but because of this
there the mech chain matching
the machine there i would have to add
another sound in between those l so it i
have to soften it and make it liable
but the problem is according to my
husband how i pronounce
it's not entirely correct but for me
all i can produce is this yi
sound adding this y sound in
english into the l so it makes it like
the java but it's not entirely correct
i'm still practicing it
i don't know when i will get it right
but all i can do is practice
okay another rule when softening a
slovak
syllable is when you see in the spelling
when it's using the e
d e and e the i t i
n i and it's pronounced
not sure if i'm right so let's take for
example the word
let's spell it t e t a i would normally
pronounce it as
teta but in slovak you have to soften
the
t e and you make the sound
and it's the same thing as in the gen
wherein you have d
e n spelled in ten but you pronounce it
jen so can you imagine how difficult it
would be
if all these rules of the sound is
combined in one word
and or maybe in one sentence it will be
a
tall nightmare for example
[Music]
it's meaning is something like can you
help me
third the clenching of the words like
the nouns i think this is the main
reason why slovak language is such a
difficult language
for me to learn because no knowing
that there are seven grammatical cases
in slovak language
so a noun would follow a several
declension pattern this may sound
very technical what declension means but
basically it means that the structure of
the word
changes depends on what is the
grammatical case
so for example if the it varies if it's
um based on gender if it's male
or female it could vary based on
whether it's singular or plural for
example
the word yetna which is number one in
english
can have a lot of variations in slovak
language
let me show you guys two grubs
that i found which best describe the
declension pattern
of the word yetna it's here
and mind you guys this is just one
pattern there are
a lot of declension pattern in slovak
language so how could i possibly
remember
all these words knowing that it only
pertains to one original word which is
number one that is absolutely crazy my
husband says okay
fine just use one word whatever
grammatical case is that slovaks will
understand
alright fair point fine with me but the
problem starts
when the other slovak person speaks to
me and instead of using yetna which the
one i know and recognize
the other slovak person will use the
correct
form which could be yet no
yet the best case scenario is that
i will load for a couple of seconds
until i realize that aha
it's vietnam it means one but most of
the time
i couldn't recognize say oh i'm lost
okay the fourth one is the sounds
of the letters
okay guys i will just put it in the
screen and read it because i cannot
pronounce it
so that sounds of those letters
it's so much easier to pronounce it it's
even hard to pronounce it alone but
imagine if you combine it in the words
already
so let's take for example the word
foreigner which in slovakia is
tsudzenet and the word boyce is
um clapti and the word
railway station is jealous
[Music]
i'm so good no not at all
and then again the pronunciation is
really really tricky
and we have to be careful because just
one
wrong roll of your thumb and the entire
meaning of the word could be really
different
like for example let's take the word gm
which means living and you can say shiem
which means sowing and there's there's
another one
pochem which means hearing and
which means chewing i find it really
difficult because this sound is not very
common on my
native language tagalog in my second
language english
so what i do is i produce the
sound that my muscles in the thumb in
the mouse
are used to fifth the phonetic
difference between
h and ch this is really tricky for me
because sometimes i
forget when to use the sound of the
letter h
and the ch and also making sure
that i enunciate the sound of the
h clearly because most of the time it
gets lost
somewhere i don't know where it goes but
i think because in
english h is normally silent letter
and we don't normally um pronounce or
enunciate it clearly for example haladni
what is hori i forgot what is hori
leave me in the comment below what is
hoary and the last
but not the least the exit and difficult
slovak words
the fact is slovak language just have a
lot of difficult slovak words
that are impossible to pronounce
sometimes they just contain consonants
without
vowels or just combination of crazy
sounds that you cannot even pronounce
for example the marslina the mercelina
who are pronounced that's
so good so where's lina which is ice
cream
stravertok which means thursday and
which means market all right so those
are
all the reasons that i think for me
slovak language is such a difficult
language to learn
but it is not all bad things because in
fairness to the slovak language
though i know that there may be some
exceptions to the rules as any language
has
for me slovak language is pretty
straight
forward in terms of pronunciation
you pronounce how you spell it at least
for some of the words that i have
encountered so far
i know that there are some exceptions
but i will not talk about
that in this video because it will be a
lot of different topic
it's not like in english you know that
it's a lot complicated that you really
have to know the pronunciation of the
word by heart
like for example the letter c
it's not always pronounced as or it
doesn't always sound as
see the c sometimes it sounds k
which is same as in cop class
cut and sometimes it sounds the soft
sea which is like in cinnamon
cell city but in slovak it's always
as long as you remember the spelling of
the word you can pronounce it
given that you can pronounce the sound
properly
also if you ask a slovak to pronounce
the word tunnel in english
they would say tuna tuna
it's a fair pronunciation given the
spelling but
in slovak it will be tuna
but in english it's tunnel i remember
one time when we were listening in the
radio
and the guy in the radio said the word
radar and i was like i asked my husband
what
is the meaning of radar and he said like
it's the tool that you use to track or
monitor
something and i was like oh yeah razor
alright guys that's all i wanted to
share with you guys today i hope that
you like this video and it was helpful

slovak language or just maybe a new
language
