i don't know why i'm crying
there were so many hateful comments and
aetheric koreans they just attacked me
because i'm korean ouch actually it
hurts
i apologize on behalf of koreans but i'm
not the one who call you that
right and i hate being racist too
now i think it is like so many people
got mad about this issue right
like honestly what i realized from the
comments is so many hateful filipino
people warriors were there and many many
filipinos tried to
forgive and try to move on i was very
touched by that point and some points
yes
you guys are right we have to move on
passes past right
but um all the nationalities and all the
people have different characters but
you guys will never understand the
relationship between
korea and japan it's been always there
like chronicle
okay so i don't want to make it like too
have it for today um
but there are many issues so i hope you
understand that
it's just a few koreans okay actually i
don't i didn't want to do the reaction
on the korean guy
doing that i'm not sure if it's korean
he doesn't look like korean at all for
me
by the way um so i don't want to give
him attention because it's very
worthless
i think i don't know when i look at the
video it gave me like lots of bad energy
i saw like more than 70 or 80 people
mention like oh react to this and react
to that
and i hope people won't get mad about
him it's just like you can tell this
guy's really really weird but
if i were filipino i would be so mad too
because the flag
so i don't want to do reaction on that
but i want to talk about this filipino
guy
um who did a parody of him
exactly this is my point i want to share
some of the comments that gave me
really good vibe so maybe if i read it
through
i hope you can feel the vibes too

move on is the best medicine
from the bottom of my heart
