hi my name is
good morning welcome back to my channel or welcome 
if you're new here today's an early one it's 5am  
we're going down to meet our a person who's 
driving us all the way to the canyoneering  
spot to three hour drive we're a little 
bit late well we're just on time let's go
so it's about 5 30 in the morning and this is 
definitely probably the earliest that i've been up  
that i can remember for a very long 
time but we're just in the car now we  
have about a two and a half ish hour 
drive all the way down to the falls
okay so we just got here and today we're here 
for a collaboration with kawasan canyoneering  
i'm going to leave all their details and 
everything in the description bar below it  
was a pretty long drive it was about three hours 
we've gone from our hotel where we're staying in  
cebu down to all the way here which i believe is 
around the mobile area um it was about three hours  
drive so it was a long one but we're about to get 
started i think we're here at the headquarters  
so i think we're gonna get suited up and ready 
to go i'm pretty sure but i'm pretty excited  
pretty tired it's about eight o'clock in the 
morning now so it's been a long morning already  
but let's go in and let's get started and we're 
just about to get like suited up with like your  
life jackets and your like all your equipment and 
things like that and then we can start on the on  
the day and on the stuff she said that we're going 
to be like jumping like swimming flying basically  
and swinging everything like that so i'm pretty 
excited a bit nervous bit scared but mostly  
excited what about you pretty excited i'm not 
nervous at all really for any of this sort of  
stuff no you're good at this i'm the scared one 
so it looks like we wear like a life jacket and  
a helmet everything like that safety at first you 
can tell i'm nervous i'm starting to talk a lot
all right i've got my helmet on i got my vest 
on i have as cow down here hey puppy he's just  
sleeping like me so it'd be interesting to see 
the calisthenic falls has changed a lot in the  
last 12 months and like it was a natural disaster 
again along though a cyclone called cyclone dead  
basically it devastated this whole area so this 
this building would have been affected it's right  
in the water as well but it went straight 
through kawasan falls and it's changed quite  
a lot let's do it i'm scared you're fine no i'm 
excited i'm excited basically it's been a pretty  
easy process so far we just literally walked in 
there set us up they told us what was going on  
we're gonna do a zipline a small walk down to like 
the canyons obviously jump through them into some  
water different heights different levels of jumps 
as well it's gonna be a super super super fun day  
i'm really excited all right let's get ready 
i'm procrastinating a little bit but let's go  
okay so since i'm facing my fears today uh if you 
could do me one favor in return and that would be  
to click the like button and the subscribe button 
on this video that means a lot to me helps me do  
more of these things and i'm putting my life 
on the line today we're going on a zip line  
i don't even know how high so do that before we go 
on that would be so cool and let's get into it so  
right now we're just taking a bike we're getting 
driven to where we actually start like walking and  
ziplining and going like that through the oh the 
jungle so we're on the way there now on the bike
okay so now we're walking up here to the 
zoo that was a snake snake that was a snake
okay so we're walking past the snake um and 
up to the zip line and that saves us like a  
45 minute walk um to where we're going instead 
of that walk you just take the zip line and it  
takes you straight there seems like the 
easy way but is it really the easy way  
let's see okay i'm just getting my vest and 
everything done make sure you do it good yeah  
so hopefully this will um take me on the zip 
uh safely because it's all the way down there
i'm a little bit nervous i'm shaking 
a little bit i'm scared how you going
oh this is very like an awkward uh like position
ah
oh stand up okay
i'm still shaking thank you i just came from there
thank you guys
okay
now apparently he heard me screaming when he 
was running here underneath me on the on the  
zip line i didn't think anyone heard me so 
i thought i got away with it but i didn't  
what was i doing oh my god literally just like 
that it was like that so we just did a short sort  
of walk down the like cliff i guess and we're just 
seeing the falls now and the water is literally  
crystal clear it looks so nice and just like pure 
if that makes sense this looks cool i'm excited  
i'm already sweating so that's a good start and i 
hear some screaming what is it this is the victory  
so we're going to start off with a water 
massage and go in the water under the waterfall
step into the water
it's cold in there that's 
the show you good it's cold
so we're just like lining up there's a couple 
people in front of us to do the first jump  
are you excited yeah i'm keen i'm inside i 
can see like the rocks below um in the water  
so he told me it's deep enough for me to jump 
though so i'm going to trust him no not yet
oh my gosh
wow okay that was a lot further than it looks 
like wow that was kind of scary on the way down
oh good god
yes
ah
it's cool now you just like kind of float 
like with the current like i'm not really  
swimming you just kind of like get taken along 
which is good when you want a little rest a  
lot of climbing through the roofs stop 
over right there five minutes from here
i have an evidence how you got it it is really 
slippery the rocks are quite slippery but if  
you go slow and take your time it's okay but i'm 
just really clumsy this is really cool like you  
have like bits where you like have to you know 
kind of take a little bit of energy and like  
time and like think where you're gonna put your 
feet and stuff and it's a little bit taxing um on  
your body but then you get parts where you're 
just like wading through the water like this  
yeah and it's really cool and it's really 
worth it you get to like have a break for a
gatorade second
how much for water how much people 
don't want very much oh thank you
and now we're just gonna have some food at the 
halfway hand some water before we get going  
but let's have a trade so mine was 50 pesos 
each queue up with 30 for the water and i think  
it was going to cause 20. it smells incredible 
and you guys know i love anything on a skewer
it's so like tender i like that that's delicious
if you want some spicy oh no spices
but there's little bits in there 
supposed to be cooked over the coals  
they're like crispy but the inside is soft it's 
really delicious this might be one of my favorite  
skewers we've ever had i'm not just saying that 
that's really nice so we're about to do the  
second oh it's cold again we're gonna do the 
second tallest jump which is like about eight  
meters and the tallest one is ten meters and 
that's it down there we just had um some lunch so  
hopefully it doesn't come out the other way but 
i jump that's for sure look how tall it looks  
okay all right i'm ready no i'm not no i'm not i'm 
ready no i'm not i'm not but you are are you gonna  
do no okay michael's gonna skip this one every one 
of them is optional which is really good to know  
which one is this this is our fourth 
jump or third jump five perfect okay wow
you got it you're right
you got it
so are you ready to jump i'm ready to jump 
can i see your smile yeah one two three
yeah michael skips the poor one by 
the way what was that for oh yeah
it was really nice it was a 
reference i'm a broad fella  
and i was worried about getting 
stuff on the way down my shoulder  
so this is my favorite part just jumped off a 
big cliff and now you get to just float away  
like you didn't just jump off a big 
cliff so this is actually so peaceful
this is beautiful we're like floating in 
this canyon with this crystal clear water  
look how blue this is this is absolutely 
amazing and our tour guide has been so  
funny and made it so much easier to jump 
off some cliffs so definitely check out
sorry i got a bit scared i just remembered i 
have a big um like a 10 meter one to jump off  
next and i forgot my train of thought okay 
i think i can touch the ground now no icon
that one was really strong
oh doggies if you want some 
coffee there's a red hose  
that's what i'll throw up on the jump 
down hello oh hey puppy what is it
in that means dog that means dog 
coffee no it's not a joke no dog a dog  
no it's not a joke hey there was a puppy back 
when we first started and he said his name was  
ascal and i was like okay cool that's a cool name 
but apparently that's just like what dog means  
and we're calling them dogs but i've learned that 
that's ascal dog chicken wow look how blue it is
okay that was cool the last like 20 minutes 
has been sort of like a cool sort of yeah a  
bit more low impact of a walk um just through 
the beautiful like middle of the canyon i guess  
but apparently the big waterfall's 
coming up so stay tuned for that one  
um because that's scary isn't 
it once you've done it scary
it looks taller up here it looks a lot taller 
up here there it is okay it looks tall from  
up here look it does so it might be hard to 
tell the depth on camera but it is so high it  
looks way higher than 10 meters it looks 
way higher than 10 meters josie's scared
ready easy oh no it's not easy
well done
so that was the longest one like that 
took probably 10 years to hit the water  
that was a little that took a long time and 
when you were under there it felt like you  
were under there for like 10 minutes i actually 
like clenched my drawer a bit because i was so  
scared and now my teeth hurt a little bit 
but it was really fun no one more no no  
yeah it looks a lot taller from when 
you're up there i'm telling you right now  
hi so that actually wasn't that bad it did look 
a lot like higher when you were up the top but  
the and the impact on the water was probably 
like the like toughest like the strongest um  
and the feeling in your stomach when 
you're falling through the air was the  
like strongest through that one as well 
but actually wasn't that bad i'm so glad i  
did it it was like really well worth it that the 
waterfalls this new one yeah they're like made up
mother nature
this is amazing oh so beautiful 
here in the philippines  
so apparently that was the jump they had sort 
of before the typhoon and everything like that  
and that one's 15 meters and the one i just jumped 
off earlier was 10 meters so it's a lot taller and  
it looks a lot scarier and i mean you can't do it 
anymore anyway but i'll probably pass on that one  
have you done that one yeah 
many many times many times
so this is it this is the end this 
is the part at the very bottom  
definitely worth definitely worth 
it so now we're up here on the roof  
and as part of the package they've prepared some 
food or some lunch or something for us to eat on  
as soon as we got back spring rolls yeah 
vegetable spring rolls chicken yeah chop soy
mango mango mango mango so just finished eating 
what good timing it's just starting to rain on me  
right now luckily i'm still half wet it was 
an amazing day it was so good i can't even  
begin to explain to you how pretty it was 
how beautiful it was it's been a long day
