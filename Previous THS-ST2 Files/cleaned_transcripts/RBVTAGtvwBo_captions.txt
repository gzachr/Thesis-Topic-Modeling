Now the first Filipino false friend
is the classic :
When naturally we understand
 something's gone wrong
Whereas in Filipino
is actually a sign of agreement
similar to how we would say
So panic over
Up second...
Now in English, we understand
 'nosebleed' pretty literally
whereas in Filipino, it actually means
There's just too much English 
being spoken around me
So they're either struggling 
to understand you
or to express themselves
so if a Filipino says
Don't give them a tissue
just give us a break
and thirdly, in the Philippines 
if someone says...
They're not necessarily 
looking for their mother
In some regions, they're likely
talking about their
a mixture of...
that you chew
and spit
which heats up the body
and makes the teeth nice & strong
according to the locals
So hopefully now
you know your Filipino friends 
from your Filipino foe
and if you like languages 
& like our videos
then subscribe to...
that was a bit of a fail right ?
