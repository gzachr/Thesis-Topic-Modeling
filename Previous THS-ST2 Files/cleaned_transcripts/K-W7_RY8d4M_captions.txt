who's ready to read can you raise your

okay
i think we got someone that's ready this
book is called lemon lesson and it's by
randy desous
jeremy passion that's right can you show
me your energy without screaming just go
yeah
good job what are these things
socks where do they go do they go on
your head
yeah i think they go right here right no
they go on your feet on your feet that's
right i am the one that's mismatched and
the same at the same time oh that's cool
i think that's stylish so the limit says
it's starting to rain oops i slipped up
with my feet got up right away and
continued down the street so when you
slip should you just stay on the ground
like this
no just get up but first you have to go
home and get and get some rain boots
instead oh that's a good idea you're
really smart the lemon says there's so
many dogs in this neighborhood barking
really loud
but it's all
good
it's all good but also annoying
it might be annoying that's right but
you know what sometimes you don't have
to let it annoy you do you guys know
what a good attitude means it's like
when you do something nice yeah
okay ella what do you think it means i
think it means to listen to someone in a
bit yeah you know what
in this book it explains having a good
attitude so remember when the lemon fell
and he slipped in the puddle he got back
up right but but but actually you just
go home one time and and get your brain
boots on yeah
well thank you so much for letting me
read to you i appreciate it you're
