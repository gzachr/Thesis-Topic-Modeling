Let's go watch together the 
whale sharks!
It is so exciting seeing those magnificent creatures
just a few meters from you.
Wow !
This is a wow experience !
There's one thing you have to keep in mind.
The traffic !
It's horrific !
We've done 100 km in 4 hours.
Which is a nightmare...
On the day of the trips we spent more
time in the car than we actually spent
doing fun stuff and seeing new things ...
Done it !
And now begins the fun part !
1, 2, 3, JUMP !
How was that first jump ?
Great !
Were you afraid ?
Yes, I thought I was going to hit the rocks ...
This one has been a little harsh.
Felt like somebody smaked you over your head.
Yes, I can hear a thing in my ear ...
My ear just popped !
How was the 10 meters jump ?
Did you like the sardines ?
Yes !
Now we're on Pescador Island and we're snorkeling
to see the coral.
And then, the final stop will be to find
the turtles.
I'm crossing my fingers to see at least
one turtle.
If you come here for the tours,
You'll best get your hotels in Cebu City
because if you stay in Mactan
You'll have to add another hour to that
long time spent in the car.
Even though you're closer to the airport
but coming from trips will be a nightmare.
Practically the whole Sumilan
Island is one big resort.
Is the Blue Water Sumilon.
They have shuttles to go to the sandbar
they have restaurants
and it's quite big and quite a nice place.
What's amazing about the Philippines is that the water is
as clear as it looks on postcards.
Everything is so so clear.
It's amazing !
Hello!
Hi!
The plexiglas bottom of the kayak
works like if you had the goggles on
so you can get a clear view of what's on
the bottom and even though there are not
many fish the coral are really beautiful.
Our guides Diane told us that a few years ago
it was like a big waterfall with lots of water and
now it's only like a shower.
This is all because of global warming.
Hopefully, we, humans can do something
about that.
It would be a shame to lose a wonder like this.
Take a look !
I passed right under it !
It was like a cold shower !
I'll do that again !
So, if you liked our Cebu tour,
Give it a big thumbs up and maybe a subscribe
because we've got coming
some more great videos and if you have
any questions concerning the Cebu City
the entire island and the trips just
comment down below and we'll answer  right away.
Bye, guys !
