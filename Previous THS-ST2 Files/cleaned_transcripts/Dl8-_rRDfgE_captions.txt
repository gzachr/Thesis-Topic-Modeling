This rusted
old World War two ship is at the center
of a heated dispute between China
and the Philippines.
Tensions are so high that a Chinese ship
collided with a Philippine boat
that was trying to resupply it.
The ship, named the Sierra
Madre, was intentionally grounded
by the Philippines in 1999.
And in a bid to assert its maritime
rights, the Philippines has kept
a small detachment of Marines on board.
The ship sits here on a reef known in the West
as Second Thomas Shoal
and the Philippines, says the shoal lies
within its exclusive economic zone.
But Beijing claims
sovereignty over the shoal
and most of the contested South China Sea.
China has used water cannons and lasers
to deter the Philippines
from resupplying the Sierra Madre.
Moves Beijing says are justified.
China's distorting the story to fit its own ends.
If the dispute continues to escalate,
it could have big implications
for the United States, since Washington
and Manila have a mutual defense treaty.
