We have already given the information
and we go to the reaction because we are curious
to know how this song was in the interpretation
of the great Morissette
Let's react!
Wow!
I love the way
as Morissette puts "Drive"
she does it very easily
she really has a great vocal ability
because this way of singing, putting "Drive"
is a very advanced technique
it is necessary to have a great knowledge
about your own voice
to be able to do this, and how it does it with ease
This use of the "Drive" is a characteristic of Morissette's voice
Whenever she can use this at some point in her performance, she puts
Very cool, because it exploits this feature a lot
But not only that
has a very great potential
to use ornaments like melisma
it makes very beautiful melismas
for low notes and for low notes
She is really very talented Morissette
This issue of using the "Drive" is so beautiful
really impress
the way she emphasizes this technique
in their performance or interpretation
This also helps a lot in your performance because
Because the "Drive" brings a force and aggressiveness for its interpretation
this is very harmonious with what she wants to express
she also uses the body to sing, she does not stand still
she moves
and her facial expression changes according to what she sings
That is, besides being a great singer, she is also a great performer.
Morissette is sensational
Remember that "Drive" is a very different technique than "Fry"
the "Fry" is
In this case you need to decrease the volume of the voice to emit this sound
The "Drive" does not need
the drive can be used in various ways, at various intensities
more generally in high notes, a more open voice
and much in the voice of the mask
I need to make a remark
as Morissette has a very good respiratory technique
because it puts ""Drive", melisma
all these ornaments
and still moves on the stage
it is very important that the artist has a control 
over the air he is emitting
-over the air he is emitting
-Administration
And she does it very well
otherwise she could run out of air
and besides wearing all those vocal ornaments
she also holds the notes very well
-She also holds the notes very well
-Yes
we must remember that besides doing all this
she uses belting
is the emission of the note where the air leaves without obstacles
in close voice the modal voice
Usually belting is used in mixed voice
it is as if the air exits in a very free way, it is necessary to have a control of the breathing
because, as Nah said, she uses many vocal ornaments
besides the corporal expression
because she does not use the voice alone, she expresses herself with the body as well
and this is another great feature of Morissette
this way of demonstrating, interpreting what she sings
Because the singer
he is also an interpreter
because it has this question of the body
where the body acts along with the voice
-She is incredible, we are very fans of Morissette
-Yes
-Blimey...
-It is breathtakin
It is breathtakin because
it's great to hear an artist like Morissette
the more we react to it
the more we are impressed by her talent
since from the beginning
we have already seen that she is that type
of artist who in a short time already
shows that she has great ability and vocal domain
But it surprises us more and more
your talent is infinite!
We even realize that she used the "Staccato" 
the "Staccato" is a note emission that is not successive
It has intervals
Different from Legato
is cool because she always surprises us
we know she's a singer
who has a lot of potential
she's a great singer
we've seen how talented she is and that's indisputable
we've seen how talented she is and that's indisputable
But what surprises ...
It is that she chooses the perfect moments to use the vocal ornaments
she does not deliver everything at once
She manages everything very well
in each presentation she uses ornaments and techniques in a different way
That is, she is very careful in preparing her performance
She knows how to manage the vocal ornaments very well
of course, as we mentioned in this presentation
 there are some characteristics that come from her artistic personality
such as the use of "Drive",melisma,apogiatura
all in the right dose, and in a very smart way too
because she does not exaggerate, she always uses, but in the right measure
She always uses the embellishments in a very good way, in the right measure
The morissette is incredible
-Amazing!
-For sure
But this is our opinion
now we want to know your opinion
so comment on what you think of this presentation
And we want to know two things
