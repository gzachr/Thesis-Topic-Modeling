- Damn, it's pretty cold.
People are wearing jackets.
It's like four or five degrees.
We're gonna be trying out balut.
Balut is a famous Filipino delicacy.
This is basically duck eggs.
It's cooked and there's gonna
be a lot of nice juices.
(rock music)
We're back and now we're gonna to try
the balut for the very first time.
I've never had it.
It's my first time trying
it, let's see how it tastes.
Alright.
Ugh.
(man laughs)
It's really salty,
it's really salty but it's okay, right?
I think.
(man chuckles)
I think it's delicious.
(man laughs)
But it's really salty, it's really salty.
It's okay, it just tastes like an egg.
It's not that big of a deal,
but it just looks like a
gross egg, it's really gross
but it doesn't taste bad.
Out of ten,
I would say it's probably a seven.
So it's more than five.
It's okay, it's not something
I would eat everyday
but it doesn't gross me out.
I got a lot of people
watching me right now.
Let's see who wants to try it.
Do any of you guys wanna try the egg?
Do you wanna try it?
- No I'm good.
- No thanks man.
- Do any of you guys want,
I know you wanna come try the egg.
Come try it.
Do you want it?
Five bucks, five bucks on the line.
I'm selling it really hard.
Five bucks to try an interesting egg.
So you never had a balut before right?
You don't even know what this is?
- No, I know what it is,
I've seen it on YouTube.
- Okay.
- I've seen many guys go
out, 'cause I go out to Asia.
- Okay.
- So I know.
- But you never, have you had this before?
- But I've never had it.
- That's a duck egg, what
do you think out of 10?
- Five?
- Five?
Okay, so you're not into it.
Do you wanna try one more?
- No, no this is good enough.
This is good, I mean
it's, I didn't feel like
that exotic taste, kinda like an egg
but not like my normal eggs.
So, that's probably why I put a five,
'cause you know, (mumbling) regular eggs
but.
- Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah, I'll eat the whole thing.
It tastes, it's good enough to eat,
so I'll put maybe give it a six.
- Six?
Okay six.
Six outta 10, that's not bad.
Got my first customer here today.
Oh, do you wanna try it?
