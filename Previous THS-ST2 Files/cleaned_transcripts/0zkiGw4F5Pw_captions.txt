hello everybody my name is katrinka i'm a
professional singer and a voice coach and
welcome back to my channel today we're gonna
be reacting to one of my all-time favorites
maurice said among i'm gonna be honest with
you it was a clear choice because when i found
out that she did a fly like a birdie cover
and she did it in a very jazzy bluesy style
which is me i was so hyped and i just couldn't
wait any longer i wanted to do the video asap
for me for you guys too of course but like
for me i cannot wait this will be a fusion
of one of my favorite walk lists and my favorite
genres so i cannot wait let's get into that
if you're interested in more of voice coach
react and you would like to submit a request
for me to react to i stream voice code reacts
live on mondays on my live stream and then
on wednesdays and fridays i do live concerts
so come hang out i'm pretty sure you're gonna
have a lot of good time with us there's gonna
be link in the description of this video
two two
oh i love this [Music] such a good vibe to
it
[Music]
[Music]
okay [Music]
okay well okay so she started it really really
very lightly it's very much suiting into the
bluesy and just the atmosphere that she's
bringing i really freaking like it but what's
really really typical for maurice sad and
for of very good singers even though she's
singing super lightly with her hat voice it's
still absolutely precise and her head voice
is still powerful enough for her to keep the
punch of the song it's powerful enough to
keep the pace of the song but it's still super
light for you to be like oh my god this feels
like cloud like it feels so weightless it's
really beautiful
[Music] if we love each other we would find
victory [Music]
oh there we go [Music] oh
[Music] can we give credit to background singers
too i think this is a beautiful orange mom
[Music]
i love maury holy [Music] we started super
lightly to be able to belt more later and
she's definitely doing it i cannot wait for
it finally because i feel like it's gonna
be huge and she's already getting us in the
mood so let's continue [Music] [Applause]
she knows how to land those high notes trading
ahead
[Music]
oh [Music] [Applause]
very effortless like you can tell i'm gonna
replay the last part because i don't want
to cut off the finally but just in her typical
fashion she started with like fly like a bird
phrase in a very head voice very lightly but
then she showed us that she can build it perfectly
so again it's more of stylistic choice also
we already had a few girls more girls are
just so adorable like i cannot take them seriously
they are so cute like hello [Music]
[Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music]
[Applause] [Music]
those girls
yes i was waiting for it
[Music]
she's adorable okay so she's so adorable i'm
sorry that i completely braced into love at
the very end of the song but i i just couldn't
like she was like hey i'm gonna hit this insanely
i know that my whistle and i'm gonna be like
[Applause] who does that so this song is pretty
difficult just in the fact that it's quite
a fast pace so you have to focus on every
single note that you're hitting it's quite
fast paced so you can get lost a lot there's
a lot of runs there and she was just handling
them perfectly even though she was singing
with a very very light head voice at the beginning
of the song it was still strong enough for
you to feel like it's carrying forward then
we also got a very legendary mora whistle
where she completely kills me every single
time she does whistle i don't know it's like
a it's like a drug you hear it once and you're
like okay i wanna hear his singing like a
hundred times more her whistles are out of
this world they're pure they're effortless
and also she said jesus what a whistle whistle
itself is incredibly difficult to do on its
own but she actually pronounced a whole word
like a whole word and that jesus was actually
quite fitting word to what she did there whether
she's gonna sing the phrase in that chest
voice head voice if she's gonna belt it that's
all just her choice and i mentioned in the
last video even though she crams a lot of
elements in one song like girls whistle this
that that that that it's somehow still not
overflowing the song is still readable when
i completely forgot one last thing that i
wanted to mention was that this particular
song is very flowy there's quite a quick pace
when it comes to a phrasing so it's a lot
of words a lot of phrasing you basically don't
have a lot of space to rest it's very important
to choose properly when you're gonna breathe
so the birth control was fantastic but also
also the breath placement was great i'm giving
all the kudos to all the background singers
and all the instrumentalists that were in
this video i think they were all fantastic
like the vibe of the song and overall the
flow you know i melted i admitted i'm not
afraid to say that so thank you so so much
for watching i really appreciate it i hope
you enjoyed the video if you would like to
