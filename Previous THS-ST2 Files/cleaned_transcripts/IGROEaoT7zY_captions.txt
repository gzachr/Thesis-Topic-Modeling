first time good morning guys we are once
again here in London and about to go see
the Tower of London so come follow us
before we go any further we just want to
thank our returning subscribers for your
continued support and to our new viewers
out there thanks for watching
pinay mom's blogs
the Tower of London has become one of
the most popular tourist attractions in
the UK it has a very rich history and
has endured its reputation to be a place
of torture in the 16th and 17th century
thus it's also known for its notorious
ghosts and ghost sighting stories... um,  that's not for me
but the tower has also served as an
armory for storage of their military
equipment a public record office it is
the home of the Royal Mint and home to a
hundred forty royal ceremonial objects of
the British kings and queens known as
the crown jewels hi guys so we are here
we're about to see the crown jewels here
in this building unfortunately we cannot
film inside the crown jewels are located
behind the White Tower of this medieval
fort they are housed in a gallery and
because it's a bit crowded you need to
walk in line inside and wait for your
turn before you get a fantastic up-close
and personal view of beautiful diamonds
and precious jewels as well as royal
dresses and other accessories it is no
wonder this jewel house is heavily
protected by armed guards I feel very
lucky to have seen them
we are here at the city of london which is separate to
the Tower of London in the background
there you see the shard which is in
London City the city of London
hi and here in the background we have
the building with the crown jewels and
here of course this is the white tower
within the background of course the
famous Tower Bridge not to be confused with the london bridge because its not the same one
because of our tight schedule we decided to skip other areas of the castle and instead head towards
another popular destination crossing the
Thames River and this would be
the Tower Bridge
inside the tower walkway by the bridge
the Tower Bridge is another popular and
iconic tourist spot as it consists two
towers connected together by two
walkways of the upper level which is
where we're at right now and the
interesting part this walkway has glass
floors and I'm not very comfortable
walking on them but let's see how
everybody else fared
