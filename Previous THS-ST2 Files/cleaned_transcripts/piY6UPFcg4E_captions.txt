Boracay in the Philippines is often named one 
of the best islands in the world but it comes  
at a cost overcrowded and no privacy, back in 
2018 Boracay was called a cesspool the island  
was shut down for six months so it could 
recover from the over-tourism but has the  
island changed and should you visit it good 
morning and we are back in the Philippines  
I'm so excited to be here this morning we're 
heading straight to the beach it looks like  
it's rainy season so really good starting 
pretty wet last night wasn't it yeah it  
rained a lot look at the sea here 
in Boracay it just looks incredible
so we just come down to White Beach this is 
the most popular Beach on the whole island  
of Boracay it literally stretches from one end 
of the island to the other however we've come  
right down to the south end of the beach because 
most of the resorts and all the hotels are right  
up the other end and so if you come down this 
side it's a lot more local feel there's not as  
many tourists it feels More Chills out like yeah 
rather than near like the mall and everything up  
there it can be a little bit chaotic up there 
we'll show you that maybe a bit later one thing  
we've heard about Boracay before we come is that 
the sand is supposed to be really really soft but  
we've been to Balabac where the sand is literally 
incredible like Maldives and it's rained right now  
so it's really hard to tell but it is pretty 
good here maybe not quite bad at that level  
but this sand is beautiful still and obviously 
when it dries up it's going to be a splendid
so one of the things I was not expecting when 
I came to Boracay is that there'll be seaweed  
literally all over the beach but I've actually 
read online that this is actually a good thing  
and it happens every few times a year and 
it makes the sand softer and it's really  
good just that for the health of the ocean 
and the and the beach so not complaining but  
yeah it's a little bit different to some of 
the photos you see on Instagram you know and  
one of the things they've done here in 2018 
they did a big renovation for six months they  
closed the island and they've made some 
incredible changes which has made this  
island just so much more manageable for the 
massive amount of tourists who come here and  
I'll talk about that a bit later in the video 
and there's also a lot of sellers that just  
like trying to sell you stuff all the time like 
sunglasses phone cases activities no thank you
I've already got one of those and as you 
can tell there are a lot of sellers but  
I guess that's just the Philippines and 
they're always very nice and very happy  
kind of unlike other places so I don't mind 
it too much you can have a bit of a joke with  
them and they're just having a good time because 
here in the Philippines everyone speaks such good  
English I love it so we've been here for a few 
days and we've found a great little breakfast  
spot that's a little bit cheaper than some of 
the places on the beachfront so we're gonna  
head there but in general Boracay is a lot more 
expensive than other parts of the Philippines  
so just something to keep an account if you 
are coming here and you're more on a budget
so we're just coming to nollies and these smoothie 
bowls are insane I think they're about 360 pesos  
each which is a lot better than some of the other 
places we've tried on this island it looks so good  
it's kind of like just a chocolate mousse but 
a healthy one that's so cute I want to go to  
tambisan beach don't be sand beach yeah [ __ ] is 
not that pork now is it good for snorkeling there  
oh it's snorkeling yeah it's only here oh yeah you 
want to go to a Highland roping the boat okay cool  
thank you so if you heard that conversation with 
the e-trike driver he basically said that beach  
has now become like a port so there's loads of 
boats there's loads of people everywhere and  
if you want to do proper snorkeling then you 
actually need to go on a boat tour previously  
Red Review saying it was really good snorkeling 
spots so yeah a bit of a shame also when we got  
the boat over to Boracay Island a few days ago 
when we came into tasbian Beach the water looked  
so clear so we were like oh it'd be perfect for 
snorkeling I guess if there's a lot of boats there  
there's not really space for snorkeling we want 
to go to puka Beach yeah how much is it 300 300.  
are these the new e-triks then 
do you have to charge these
switch battery yeah all right very 
expensive yeah is it more expensive  
on Boracay Island than other Islands yeah uh 
yeah because there's a small island maybe yeah
it took us about 20 minutes to get 
here in that electric tricycle which  
is not too bad but it's longer than we 
thought let's go check this beach out  
so there's quite a few markets here it's 
definitely busier than I was expecting yeah it  
kind of said online like oh this is a non touristy 
Beach but uh seems like it's a lot of people okay  
so on the actual Beach it is much less busier 
than the main white Beach and to be fair it looks  
pretty beautiful the water is glowing it's so blue 
the sound might not be super soft like the other  
Beach but I mean it's still super white and it's 
pretty beautiful out here if you want to escape  
the crowds of Baroque I definitely come up here 
onto the northern tip definitely not as wavy here  
as well everyone's trying to sell you these white 
clear kayaks maybe there's good snorkeling we will  
get back to puka Beach but I have something 
exciting to show you how do you go from this
to this using wondershare filmora 12. one of my 
favorite features in femora 12 is the AI audio  
stretcher which allows me to expand any audio to 
any length I want one of the problems I have when  
editing is constantly trying to find background 
music for my videos but by using the AI audio  
stretcher I can easily with one click and drag 
lengthen the music of my choice if you wanted  
this wave sound to stretch over the Drone footage 
using the audio stretcher you can easily do this  
by lengthening the sound creating more atmosphere 
in your videos when usually you wouldn't have any  
sound for a drone shot another audio feature 
which filmora has is music visualizers and  
these reactive sounds and music so you can add 
this to a video to recreate like a phone call  
or just add extra visuals to your video for me 
the AI audio stretcher is such a great tool and  
you've got to try it out on your next video when 
you're sharing your next video remember to tag  
filmer in your post for a chance to be featured 
on the film or at social media channels I highly  
recommend downloading femora now and unlock your 
creative potential with the audio visualizers and  
the AI audio stretch features to take your videos 
to the next level now let's get back to puka Beach  
it's like midday here on poker Beach and we found 
ourselves this little cave to hide from the Sun in  
because yesterday we did get a little bit burn 
and Joel has gone a little bit overboard with  
these yeah I mean I don't want to get burnt 
and I thought it looked kind of cool I think  
I did it better though oh better you look like 
you're in the military yeah look at this water
it looks super clear it does and 
I've just found a paddle in the water  
so I'm going to take that out it does look 
incredibly blue it's Crystal it is Crystal  
there guys I've just seen my face in the 
camera lens and I apologize for how white  
this sun cream is and it is re-safe 
Sun cream so if we're swimming here  
it doesn't matter it's natural so yeah we're 
not destroying the fishies we love the fishies
foreign
got some extra crunch on them vinegar vinegar
it's good spicy
spicy vinegar it's a bit of a suspicious 
liquid in there but it's quite nice
thank you so let's talk about what happened in 
2018 here in Boracay so back then there was six  
months of closure of Boracay so no tourists could 
actually come to this island and they basically  
did loads of work around the island to basically 
make it capable to take loads of tourists so the  
first thing they did along the beachfront the 
main white sand beach is they moved all the  
buildings back because they were right next 
to the Sea so they moved it back maybe 10-15  
meters so now they've got a long walkway all the 
way up white Beach and it's actually really nice  
especially in the evenings it gets pretty busy 
it's kind of a bit more of an ABS atmosphere one  
of the big things which the old president said is 
that this island was like a cesspool and that's  
because they were dumping all the sewage from 
all the hotels straight into the ocean so it  
wasn't actually like very pleasant to swim in the 
ocean probably not very healthy either but one of  
the big things they did was basically do all the 
sewage properly and so it's now you know gotten  
rid of properly there's actually a limit to how 
many people who can come daily to Boracay but  
it's not really kept to and just so many tourists 
are coming here which I guess is a good thing for  
the locals because there's obviously lots of 
money through the island but honestly it gets  
so busy and it's quite overwhelming if you've 
been to other parts of the Philippines bar you  
know El Nido however you preferred this beach to 
White Beach over there I honestly much prefer I  
think it's so much more calmer and Chiller 
there's like these beautiful rocks in the  
background but there's still quite a few people 
here as well and now we're gonna head back to the  
white Beach the main Beach where everyone floods 
for Sunset hopefully it's going to be a good one  
so we're just walking through Dunmore 
which is basically where there's loads  
of shops loads of little markets and 
restaurants cafes all that kind of stuff
I just saw a massive Beetle but 
now we're on our way to the beach  
for Sunset because white Beach 
is like known for famous sunset
I'm all right boss we are right next to 
the mall so this is like the busiest area  
of white beach look at everyone I mean you 
can't argue that this island is beautiful  
especially our Sunset I mean just looking 
at behind us this is Boracay at its finest
we've got ourselves a Boracay sunset foreign
we also had an amazing sunset for our 
first night here for some reason it  
seems to happen every single day 
here at Boracay and it's probably  
one of the reasons most people come 
here the sunsets are super special
we've just come to dinner at Lucy's 
bars which is just off the main like  
beachfront strip and it's supposed to 
be really really good Indian food so  
we're really excited to have them we may have 
also ordered some cocktails yes what happiest
food here in Boracay is such a big thing there's 
so many incredible restaurants you almost feel  
like all the good chefs just come here for a guy 
and make incredible Foods so try a few different  
restaurants have a lookout because there's 
so many different Cuisines and stuff to try
thank you so you can definitely tell there is
every other restaurant has like live music 
bands going off music it does feel very good  
and obviously the food which we just had was 
incredible so let's talk about our opinions  
on Boracay and why you shouldn't visit Boracay 
has been super hyped up for us after traveling  
the Philippines for like three months everyone's 
like you must visit Boracay it's one of the best  
islands in the Philippines but we have been 
disappointed personally I think we prefer  
other islands in the Philippines like shiagara 
or siki Hall where it's a lot more adventurey  
and very laid back and it's not super busy and as 
we mentioned earlier in the video it is a lot more  
expensive than other parts of the Philippines in 
shower gal literally things were half the price  
in terms of Food Tours we felt like boracai 
was more aimed at people on vacation rather  
than backpacking and in my opinion I wouldn't 
recommend going there if you're on like a month  
trip of the Philippines it also felt like there 
wasn't a lot to do on the island itself a lot of  
it was just excursions and activities off the 
island or on the water and they're often quite  
expensive they're not really in our Backpacker 
budget but if you are on holiday there would be  
pretty fun and if you are a big foodie there is 
so many different restaurants and great food to  
try just on the more expensive scale compared to 
other parts of the Philippines thank you so much  
for watching we will see you in the next video 
where we're in another country see you then bye
