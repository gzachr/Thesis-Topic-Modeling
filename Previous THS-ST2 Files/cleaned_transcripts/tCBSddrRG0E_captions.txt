We had some time to kill before we head to the airport
so we went to a spa
I'm getting a fish massage
I actually read an article about
people potentially infections from this
FEED THE FISH!!
But honestly, I'm more concerned about the fish than i am about your feet
It doesn't hurt
hey guys
salamat pagi
We're still in Malaysia in Kuala lumper
and it is day 6
yes
and we have to
check out about Airbnb 11:00 a.m.
and it is....what time?
10:30 past 10:30
it is past 10... are you sure?
yeah!
really?
yup
oh
so it's 10:19
Almost 10:30
okay so we are in the Philippines
we can
see Daniel
it's not Daniel! oops!
our flight was supposed to land at 5 a.m. it is 7:30
now. when I was initially booking the
flight there was a flight to El Nido at
7:30, I am so glad I didn't book that flight
say hey
made it through
so we made it
we are now in terminal 4
so we're almost done with this
super long travel day
we are at our final airport destination
we just got to
get on this plane
but the check out desk is not open yet
so
the Philippines is our last
destination before we head home
we're gonna take all of our foreign
currency
which includes
Taiwanese
Hong Kong
I think I did really good in Malaysia
because I only ended up with two ringits
I don't know it they will change that
and this is our final leg of the journey
looking forward to getting there
soon
possibly getting some rest
maybe shower
maybe some food
LET'S GO!
We made it to el nido
it's pretty neat O
thank you
there's no power
we're in the Philippines
we got off our flight.....
