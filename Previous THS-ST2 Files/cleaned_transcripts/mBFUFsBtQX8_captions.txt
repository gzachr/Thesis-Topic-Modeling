hey you guys welcome back to the channel my name 
is killermcnight accompanied by Queen Taylor the  
last video we had posted on this channel was 
about a Filipino man that sang at his wife's  
funeral or wait that was like a week ago and that 
video destroyed Taylor uhhuh so we haven't posted  
anything else but some of the comments in that 
video we talking about an uplifting video that  
we should check out um about Alia Almira lat the 
bride basically a bride singing at our wedding  
alira alira I think alir is correct so with that 
being said we're going to do more uplifting more  
happy positive videos because of Taylor and she's 
52 weeks pregnant right now 52 it feels like it  
sometimes 52 weeks pregnant to be accurate it's 
like 53 weeks 54 are we at 54 yet we're at 34  
we're at 34 weeks so she's pregnant AF Super 
pregnant this baby's going to be out of here  
at any time now so we have to we have to simmer we 
have to simmer on like the really highly emotional  
stuff so this is going to be good this is going 
to be good let's hop on over to the music video  
and let's get it started God I would die if 
you were pregnant for 52 weeks a few months  
ago I asked Kaboom also Al known to you as lolit 
go to write a song for my wedding day I sent him  
a few lines that I wrote myself and he fashioned 
it into a piece of poetry before he finally set  
his original music to it I would also like to 
acknowledge Mr Ian enigo for his beautiful and  
magical Arrangement and to my Kua Jr Banes 
for his Flawless mixing and mastering of the  
track so a million thanks to you guys for this 
collaborative effort thank you also for keeping  
quiet about the project I know Joshua is not 
surprised anymore that I'm the one who will  
sing for my Bridal walk but my surprise is here's 
the original song entitled oh is that the the know  
I offer this song to him and to the man I prayed 
for who is now to officially become my other half
a I'm going to cry just him crying 
no stop you're not allowed to cry  
no these are good happies not sads oh

or my protector my relief he knows you are the  
music when silence brings me down he knows you are 
the perfect fit for the soul [Music] behind oh my

BL cuz you know that only you can see me
[Music]
through and because of this I 
give [Music] you I do a sweet than
you
[Music] a very beautiful reception mhm
ceremony
you're lucky man [Music] Joshua oh 
that's beautiful actually look at  
those those little lanterns 
[Music] mhm on the [Music]
beach
wow that was like a legit
movie what I couldn't get you to shut up so I 
could enjoy it I know I was doing that literally  
on purpose cuz we're not allowed to pause ever 
I know I'm like no pausing no pausing I'm like  
a copyright all the time she's like no I don't 
care if our Channel goes into the dumpster no  
pausing so I can't pause so I have to uh shout 
things out so it distracts her so she doesn't  
cry and so cop so YouTube doesn't get us I know 
the reasoning behind it but I'm like [ __ ] you  
YouTube just let us watch uninterrupted no that's 
stealing content you have to add your own content  
to the content that you're do at the end that's 
not good enough it's not good enough for YouTube  
but it should be you have to do it during the 
content that you're reacting to it just it is  
what it is I don't make the rules I just have 
to really bend them well I'm just saying that  
I disagree with them yeah so and I do it to 
like distract you from crying and you still  
teared up a little bit upset about it was good 
was very pleasant happy tears are different than  
heartbreaking tears almira lat um I wonder if 
she's a star she's got a phenomenal voice I  
definitely see why she wanted to sing she's 
like I don't need any other song to sing me  
in I got this she's got a beautiful beautiful 
Angelic voice like stunning I could listen to  
her all day I she was beautiful the ceremony was 
beautiful everything was just topnotch the people  
who collaborated and brought this together it's 
amazing incredible yeah and it tied in a lot of  
their belief especially with God and like how they 
Incorporated his grace and his love into their  
marriage and relationship and it kind of just says 
all that in the song and it was just really nice  
yeah the whole scenario and setup of the ceremony 
was really good again I think she must already be  
a music star in the Philippines or some she's got 
to have more than just this you guys have to let  
us know if if she's done more collaborations or 
just more music has she produced more music or  
covers I'm shocked that a voice this good hasn't 
crossed our radar yet yeah seriously especially  
since we cover you know a lot of artists yeah 
from the Philippines in Indonesia um yeah for  
her name to have never come across that's what 
makes me wonder if maybe this is just more of  
a hobby to her cuz he said you know he knew I was 
going to sing coming down the aisle so it's like  
clearly she must sing along around home and stuff 
like that but absolutely yeah I'm really curious  
I thought that was so incredibly beautiful and 
him crying I've told you multiple times when we  
finally get married eventually if you don't cry 
when I'm walking down the aisle I'm tur it back  
around and it's not happening so if I don't sing 
to you on your in when you're dead you're gonna  
Haunt me yes and then now this are you guys 
keeping track of this stuff all the I must do  
it's two I don't feel like it's asking that much 
I mean there's more than just two but it's okay  
no I did get I did propose to Queen Taylor so 
we are engaged if you want to flash that blang  
blang up there in the two twos I don't know what 
do that the twoos are just trying to be cool look  
I just want a little bit of chivalry crying when 
I walk down the aisle that's non-negotiable you  
don't have to sing at my funeral I'll probably 
haunt you either way but you have to cry my  
tear ducks are like Stone get practicing okay I'm 
practicing I don't care if before I walk down the  
aisle you throw sand in your eyes you better make 
it happen all right you guys that's our time what  
did you think of this performance by almira lat 
um the bride obviously uh Joshua congratulations  
congratulations to both of you guys what an 
awesome wedding I out a 10 10 out of 10 but let  
us know down in the comments what you think and 
uh until next time we'll see you bye that was a
backwards
