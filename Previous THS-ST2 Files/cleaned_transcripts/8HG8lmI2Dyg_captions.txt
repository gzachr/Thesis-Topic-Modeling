got bulalo I think it's a definitive dish
here in zagata and then I don't know what
this is though okay
sing ing okay all right how's the soup oh
it's so tasty yeah so tasty I think it's one
of my favorite soup now will be like sinigang
and bulalo which one's your favorite can you
choose so different so different what about
you I feel like bulalo really reminds me of
it's different but I know it it kind of reminds
me of how they cook the Vietnamese pho even
though the flavor is very different but it's
just a long hours of cooking and the broth
is so dense it's so strong it's a very flavorful
I think all the meats the everything the flavors
are in the soup now meat sauce
mix demonstration 101 Okay so so you just
push it down a bit yeah yeah so it doesn't
spill yeah push it down slowly a real purple
yeah
and then with Jackfruit so our our version
is
yeah only in the Philippines yeah let's try
to go all right let's try it together
all right so after a delicious lunch now we're
gonna head over to get a massage we just want
to do a quick review of the lunches then I
think the Highlight for me was the bolalo
I think really is something so special yes
yes here's much tasty much more tasty you
like a um more you you taste more like a soup
soup like a broth so strong taste and the
meat is a lot softer as well yeah it's like
you can just spoon you can mash it and then
separate it slow cooked almost they eat like
food yeah there were four people just they
were all finished eating and I was just on
the side salad but now I kind of regret it
because now we're heading to massage and normally

my schedule all right so today's for takeout
City Tour we're going to e-lock Mario Cornerstone
Pottery Goldman farms and lastly the famous
mahogany Market I believe that's where they
sell the fresh uh fruits and like veggies
market so I think this will be quite interesting
I don't know much about a history about it
but later we're going to find out because
today we've got a guide of air and you show
us around so I can't wait to show you guys
yeah it's interesting though about the GT
more yeah because everyone introduced this
like City like wow so The Impressions so we
want to know more exactly and I think the
other day we walked around to Gateway as well
and we obviously and we walked alone in this
year we don't know much about it and even
if we do research online we just cannot relate
but if there is a local here showing us around
it definitely gets you to know about this
place more especially I want to know more
about a volcano today which today afternoon
oh I'm not done with the schedule yet so this
is only the city tour and then after that
at 12 o'clock we'll come back here for lunch
and then at three o'clock we'll go out for
another history walk so it's going to be about
the history of Tao Vista and I believe the
second oldest tell in Philippines actually
so that's only going to tell us about negating
the history the volcano Etc and also the hotel
and then after that we're going to go to the
famous sky rangers right next to the hotel
it's an amusement park so yeah I don't know
what to expect but I don't know how amusement
parks are like in the Philippines compared
to other countries yeah so keep watching And

a tricycle yeah yes it's different or different
names

bee farm interesting we didn't know what it
was yesterday we just saw the name but it
turns out honey bee farm so lots of buzzing
around you later do we get to wear protective
suits later like the white suits but uh oh
no okay anyway we're almost there so we were
told there isn't actually bees inside but
it's rather a fruit farm where you can papaya
is it papaya buco
and other crabs okay yeah let's see let's
see I thought it was a bee farm I thought
we're gonna see honey I thought it's a beef
that's even worse what kind of have you ever
had honey beef I got this like you know you
have honey chicken I thought it's like honey
beef
[Music]

the lead see
don't get too close though otherwise
yeah so cute yeah
why is he playing with the leaf it's like
a dog trying to dig something on the ground
all right so we're here honeybee Farm let's
see what to do about it it smells nice already
they designed like a honey in English yeah
it smells nice though it's fragrance and from
the soap I think yeah hello yeah it's actually

wow that's I never thought I would see your
animals like like this now we're heading to
our next destination which is called Cornerstone
which is located in
yes that long name yes okay all right let's
have it
Cornerstone Pottery Farm here and this looks
like like kind of like a residential area
I must say so I don't know what to expect
here but it's Pottery farm so I believe there
might be uh lots of like plates balls like
Pottery like using clay to make it you have
carbs everywhere so likely I like making something
yeah yeah I think it takes a lot of technique
and skills to do it so all right let's go
and have a look can we go in ah just waiting
for the handmade everything's that's very
nice a doggy needs attention okay let's go
and have a look wow they have a nice collection
here
let's see wow this looks really good yeah
I think it's good like a souvenir present
or like a family or someone it looks like
a bacteria if you come here looks like a coronavirus
yeah
thank you [Music]
all right so we're done with the pottery house
so yeah we had a look around at the portraits
you can see there they have got some quite
quite good collections around um teacups that
yeah might be useful but I know it's frequent
Travelers who might not actually use that
much
exactly yeah and yeah we've always gotta like
travel light when we travel and also it's
a shame that we cannot see the pottery making
process behind it but because apparently the
owner didn't allow it to film the process
but anyway they do have a nice collection
so if you're interested you can come here
anyway that's at the next destination which
is our last destination all right so after
around 15 to 20 minutes drive we come to this
Market which is one of the most famous local
markets here in Turkey today this place is
called mahogany uh fresh fruit market I believe
so on the first floor here is the fruit market
and the second floor it is a veggie market
and oh I think around here there is a meat
market that's very famous for bolalo usually
they buy the meats on the first one after
that on the second floor they cook it at the
restaurant so here we've got some massive
jackridge on this side that's crazy yeah usually
it's like a like this size usually but this
is huge hello hello how are you Jack was so
big here my goodness yeah compared to normal
ones thank you Summit and you've got lots
of fresh fruits here I think this is actually
our first time walking in a restaurant local
market so it's very interesting so yeah very
standard fluids oh they have avocados here
as well maybe we can get some part of it because
I do know everybody yeah we're interested
to find out how much it is

am not a big fan of Jackfruit but I know a
lot of people they like Jackfruit but I think
these are the ones we want so three avocados

can get some avocado here in the Philippines
yeah right it's been a long time like seven
months I haven't had avocados here in Australia

just tonight I think I didn't expect this
like usually when we go to market I don't
know even in Russia it's not like so many
pressure on me I cannot choose when like this
I can choose something when I really come
yeah I believe are you used to the Western
Supermarket I think but uh in in Asia it's
always like this usually people are trying
to get as many as you can they always give
you some extra um I always try to convince
you I need to bargain in your Supermarket
sometimes at like a supermarkets but anyway
I think we got it for a good price now
it's really really really good price is it
even in Russia in Russia one avocado 100.
oh wow is it in Australia it's uh how much
for an avocado in Australia I think you know
avocado in Australia they're very cheap usually
because there's so many everyone eats avocado
and bread like butter I noticed in Philippines
I don't have a lot of uh dragon fruit dragon
fruit yeah yes really yeah thank you okay
let's head over to yeah where the with a with
a Butchery happens the wet Market
you ready to put me all avocado
the problem just says I don't know if they
understand it's like the day after tomorrow

but anyway I think we've got two good avocados
I'm so excited I hope it's like that buttery
texture then that's the perfect avocado maybe
it's even a little bit hard then it's not
right yeah it depends how I like a little
bit hard really yeah oh when you go to Australia
I'm gonna let you try new of a cup like real
avocado I see like when it's so so soft it
means it's over already really no it's it's
perfect because for butter okay you want to
go back to the car
okay all right because for me it's like so
ah okay go go with him go ahead [Music] I
think you might want to go back to the car

so this is where they buy all the bulalos
and uh for the soup it does have a very strong
beef smell that uh okay I can smell a soup
from you actually is it a bolalo is it is

ah wow Ah that's uh oh that's a bone marrow
wow that's awesome yeah famous yeah okay all
right thank you yeah so you see many like
beef options yeah oh it's well done luckily
it didn't but yeah I think most sellers are
the same but this one seems to be more famous
One many people around here maybe it's the
first store because here I think they sell
similar things
yeah you can see you can hear the cutting
of the meats happening in the back here as
well take any beef see they're cutting the
beef there hello hello how are you this is
bone marrow is it very nice yeah
okay very nice yeah wow this this oh what
what are these for just like for soup as well
or sweet oh
very nice yeah I like Filipino food
adobo that one double adorable too okay very
nice thank you thank you they're very friendly
it's eager to show me different parts of meats
as well I think here more or less they are
all the same but I'm very keen to find out
what's upstairs because I heard there's a
restaurant upstairs how do I go up I go go
upstairs is it here okay all right thank you
thank you so I believe all the restaurants
are up there Alina is a it's not very good
when it comes to um Butchery so I think she
head back to the car but I guess I grew up
in Hong Kong I go to like local markets like
this very often so I'm very used to seeing
um like the Raw Cuts and everything oh there
are a couple restaurants here oh hello all
right let's see what to you Ruby's karindaria
hello how are you hello hello oh crispy things
we've got some crispy craps here I haven't
tried this one yet I wonder if you can eat
the show but I think you can if you decide
like this right you've got crispy fish over
there what else have we got here they've got
more crispy options here got some Veggie options
I don't know if there's kalikali or not it's
imperative
hello how are you how are you very good oh
you got karindaria caruinderia here it's electron
looks like ah very nice you buy the ingredients
downstairs ah okay thank you and you've got
more crispy options here I think the rest
there are many a couple restaurants here I
think this is one of the most famous place
where tourists come to eat bulalo yeah all
the names associated with the restaurants
are something really bulalo is a special pool
all over there they're a couple of Han hello
hello just having a look just having a look
I see you've got uh wow that's awesome thank
you I think it's so much eating here today
so uh anyway hello hello how are you everywhere
bolalo here from downstairs the meat ah very
nice okay thank you
and uh yeah pretty much every store here they
serve a lot of obviously because it's a quite
a long stretching restaurant here as well
over there I believe the rest of the stores
might fall out little too I don't know which
one is basically it's the most famous One
wow they have a lot of dishes here let's see
hello hello how are you can I just have a
look okay yeah let's have a look uh got uh
some veggies here yes um
yes what is buckwheat vegetable vegetables
okay and got electronically and then got a
Bolano and Black Flag oh what is this looks
like cauliflower oh is it cauliflower no oh

shell yes you can oh is it crispy very nice
you've got different fried stuff here I see
going on fresh crab fish crab prawn yeah very
nice okay thank you thank you bye-bye uh yeah
very interesting things I will try not to
stop otherwise they would think um I feel
bad
they more or less sell similar things like
many fried crab and fish so it's just a matter
of which one you go to you've got yeah more
Balo yeah more or less the display that they
have here they're more or less the same
um yeah right right fronts crab fish and Chipola
yeah I think that's the main thing that they
do here but yeah that's a very nice shot too
of what you can eat here in tokete I believe
this is where most tourists come if they want
a good pull out of soup so yeah I think that's
it for this Market quite interesting but more
or less it's just a local market where I think
most locals will come here to buy affordable
fresh food and like meat options as well I
like the name of this place it's called Kim
cats hello hello uh got a lot of internal
organs here I've got a tribes see um hello
