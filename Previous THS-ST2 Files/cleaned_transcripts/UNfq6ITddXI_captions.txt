- Hey, what is up you guys?
I'm in Manila, Philippines
and I'm joined here with Finn Snow
- What's up, guys?
- From Iceland.
I'm not only here with Finn Snow
but I'm also with the
one and only, Mike Corey.
- This isn't Mexico, where are we?
- I know, it's so weird.
I'm meeting these guys on
the other side of the world.
I met Finn in Iceland, Mike in Mexico,
and here we are in Manila, Philippines.
We're collabing today.
We're gonna go walk around,
I just got this new crane.
Nice to meet you, how's it going?
Wow.
- You hold that for a while.
- So wherever I'm going,
it's going, but smooth.
Look at this smoothness, it's crazy.
It's our first day, I just
got off a 20-hour flight.
I'm exhausted but I'm ready to film.
- Two main transports here in Manila,
or Cebu, or in Philippines,
it's the tricycles and the jeepneys.
And we're gonna do one of
them now, the tricycles.
All right, Mike, can you.
- All right.
- Mike and Cody,
get in here, I'll sit on the side.
- [Cody] Okay.
- This is the closest that
I've ever been to you, Cody.
- I think so.
- I can smell your 20
hours of flying time.
(Cody laughs)
- [Cody] It looks pretty cool, and uh.
(upbeat music)
- I'm Emmanuel, by the way.
- Emmanuel?
- Emmanuel.
- [Cody] Cody, nice to meet you.
All right, look at what we got here.
(speaking foreign language)
- Joke.
- So right now we're trying Kwek-Kwek
which is quail eggs.
- Kwek-Kwek.
- Kwek-Kwek.
Now they're cooked, it's
three for ten pesos.
50 pesos is like a dollar.
- You buy me, so delicious, yummy yummy.
- No, no, no.
Sauces first.
- Oh!
(speaks foreign language)
- What kind of sauces we have?
(speaks foreign language)
Um, vinegar.
- Vinegar.
- Vinegar and sweet and sour.
- Oh, I love sweet and sour.
- Oh yeah, very good, very good.
- And this one?
- Also sweet and sour.
- Hot, hot chili.
Hot chili, hot chili.
- Vinegar, sweet and sour.
Cody's going for sweet and sour.
- All right guys, you ready?
- Yummy.
- Yummy?
- Yummy.
- [Finn] Kwek-Kwek.
(speaks foreign language)
- Small egg, small egg.
- It's good.
It's like...
It almost tastes like
sweet and sour chicken
from a Chinese place.
(speaks foreign language)
- How hot was it?
Really hot?
- No, it's fine.
(speaks foreign language)
- Ooh, hot, you lied to me.
- It was fine for me.
Maybe I had one that was not as hot.
- Philippine money, huh, not dollar.
- What do you think?
- It's like fish and chips
but with egg on the inside.
- Yeah.
- You know, fish and chips?
- Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah.
So it's like, the burn on the outside,
I don't know why it's orange,
the orange doesn't add any taste at all.
- Yeah, I don't think
the orange does anything.
- And this isn't as vinegary
as I thought it was gonna be, or spicy.
- I liked this.
- I think I might do another
one with sweet and sour.
- Sweet and sour is the one.
- [Mike] I don't know what it was.
- All right, so this is a
traditional Philippines delicacy
called Halo-halo which
basically means mixing.
and what you got in it is
obviously a lot of ice,
some sort of Ube sauce, I believe,
because of the purple color, beans, jelly,
and some candy, and a lot of
sugar, mixed with coconut milk.
So very traditional,
you find this almost
anywhere in the Philippines.
Small islands, big cities, anywhere.
So gonna give one to Cody.
- It was 50 pesos for both.
- 50 pesos.
So the trick is with the Halo-halo,
you're supposed to mix it,
that's what Halo-halo means.
- Oh it means, mix-mix?
- Yeah, so crush, the ice, try to,
I mean it's a lot of in here.
- It's like, liter--
- Sort of watching you.
- You're just eating--
- Stand awkwardly in the background.
- Look at this, it's like multiple color,
red and purple and yellow.
- So the purple thing is
called Ube, that is a root.
- Root?
- Purple root.
Ube.
- So let's give it a try.
- It's like a milky ice cream.
- Yeah.
- It looks delicious.
- It's good.
- What are the yellow chunks?
- I think it's just jelly.
- They're just jelly cubes, yeah.
- So it's like Jell-O,
beans, coconut milk,
it's like a sevenths of the syrup's--
- Ice and syrup.
- Sugar.
- Milky rainbow.
(Finn laughs)
(Cody laughs)
- There's a lot of texture for sure.
- There's a lot in there.
- One thing we don't do in
The Americas is sweet beans.
And Asia's sweet beans are everywhere.
The first one, you have a sweet bean,
it's got the pastiness of a refined bean,
but it's sweet and you're like,
you know it's actually pretty good.
- That's cold, that's really cold.
- Overall, I like it, I like it a lot.
It's definitely good,
like it's very hot and humid here.
This is like--
- Oh, perfect for that.
- This is like ice cream
on a hot summer day.
(speaks foreign language)
- Just fun and friendly, the
kids over here in Manila.
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh, yeah.
- We've started the parade.
Eventually, we have
started the foot parade
lead by foreigners in Manila.
(upbeat music)
- Hello.
- [Cody] Hello.
- Hello.
- [Cody] Hello.
(everyone laughing)
- [Boy] There.
- Let's go that way.
- [Cody] Bye, guys.
- [Kids] Bye!
- Right now, we found the
only open place without wires,
it's an overpass over the highway.
So we're flying over
the highway right now.
It's really loud and noisy
but the sunset's looking perfect
so we're gonna take it up right now.
- All right.
- Here we go.
- Let's move a little bit,
this is the only place
Cody can fly the drone.
It's so crowded here in Manila.
- It's gonna be so crazy.
(upbeat music)
- We had a good time today,
trying out different food,
seeing all the locals, running around.
We looked through the probably
most local part of Manila.
- Yeah.
- Somehow.
- It's called Mandaluyong.
Kids there were super friendly,
everyone was super friendly.
They taught Mike how to do
some version of jump rope.
- Chinese daughter,
that's what it was called.
- Chinese daughter.
- I asked like three times
to make sure I was hearing it right
but it was called Chinese daughter.
And I was thinking you
had to jump over the ropes
but no, you have to jump one leg over,
one leg over, then jump on the ropes,
and then do it two legs, one legs.
It was strange, man.
- Yeah, Mike is heading up north tonight.
On a bus.
- I am.
I'm gonna get a tattoo from
Whang-od or one of her nieces
and I'm gonna go see cliff
mummies, cliff graves.
Mummies that they put on the cliffs.
- Cliff mummies? (laughs)
- All of the above.
- Yeah, so he's gonna see some cool stuff
but we're gonna reconnect with him
around the time of fan
fest which would be cool.
And then Finn and I are
actually heading out tomorrow
on a night bus to--
- Camarines Sur.
- Camarines Sur.
It's very hard for me to pronounce.
Basically, that's a place where it was
the most popular about five years ago
until Palawan really kicked in.
So we're, go back to the future,
we're gonna explore some of the old,
most popular destinations
in the Philippines.
- Yeah, so it's gonna be good.
