like what are the things that you kind of you 
know when when you when you see a Filipina and  
you're like you know what I want to approach that 
girl right there so you know typically guys goes  
you know we have the rating one to ten right you 
know 10 being the model S Beauty and stuff like  
that one is like a double Brown bagger you 
know that you know but some guys still want  
those I guess like what's your um how do you rate 
your Filipinas by just looking at them and stuff  
like that what are the important features 
like maybe three important features for you  
well it's interesting because there's like there's 
different variables when you when you see it babe  
like the the number one variable is that you see 
it babe and you just have some feeling about her  
okay and it could be it could be anything it could 
be like the the the like for example a girl that  
I was in love with in the past like my number 
one ex-girlfriend it was just the way she smiled  
okay it didn't have anything great on it was 
just kind of the way she smiled so anyway if  
I'm in the Phils if I see some hot babe you know 
I mean it's like she could have a great bod but  
an average face right but overall if like we 
could hash this out man but overall if if just  
it's the feeling when I see a babe when I see 
a baby Sam you know Kokomo's you've been to  
Angelus right yeah of course okay so I'm 
sitting at Kokomo's I'm seeing babes walk  
by you know like like I've asked I've asked 
myself the same question like what is it about  
some babe that catches my attention it's just 
some it's just something it could be something  
very specific about her but but if I'm going 
to be honest with you um like I got a friend  
like he likes the high heels short skirt look 
I like I like the girl I like the girl I'll  
be honest with you Mike you may disagree I like 
the girl who just arrived in Angeles an hour ago  
so the girl that just came from Latha then 
pretty much is what you're saying well that's  
one way of putting it but but before we get on 
tell me your your version of the same question  
oh yeah so you know the way I put it for myself 
if I rating one to ten I I get what you're saying  
about an average an average is a five and you know 
what there's nothing wrong with an average looking  
woman because she can she can be an adjustable 
six an adjustable you know whatever happens you  
know so for me wise I typically go for a six and 
above for me right so number one it doesn't really  
matter for like the skin color like a lot of guys 
sometimes you know say oh Michael don't like dark  
dark skinned girls uh I Married An afro-latina 
you you know so my ex-wife was Puerto Rican  
Dominican so you can't tell me that I don't like 
dark skin right so um so it's not about that it's  
about facial features for me like I I have to 
be honest and this is preferences right like I  
I cannot do a Filipina whose nose got run over by 
a rolling pin okay I'm just saying that's just me  
um hair wise has to be past the shoulder and the 
reason for that is you know there's a thing in  
the Philippines that when Filipina starts cutting 
their hair short they're giving up in life because  
typically you see Filipinas cut their hair 
short when they turn 50. and it gets curly  
you know they put it in a pyramid read glasses 
you know being worn and stuff like that either  
the fake or the real Louis Vuitton bag walking 
around and stuff like that so you know so to  
me maybe that is kind of you know whatever 
but once again it's my preference for that  
um height wise 4 11 and up that's not much to ask 
you know 411 up I think is perfectly fine for me  
um but must look good in a dress is my thing 
because there's some Filipinas who puts on a  
dress and you're just like no go back to jeans 
like for some reason they can't it's it just  
doesn't work on them um but that's the thing 
men are men are visual creatures you're right so  
because the fact that we're visual creatures you 
know we have to look at Beauty to be attracted  
to them and somehow for us to approach them you 
know so anyway uh on your point there like uh  
like I went to hinahu you know who you familiar 
with the Mindanao area anyways I I went to I got  
I met some babe on the website right and I went 
to uh some small little uh town to meet the Babe  
right okay and so the thing is when we talked I 
was living in kage andoro at the time okay and  
so it's like a four-hour bus ride I went to meet 
her small town and it was it east or west of CDO  
um it is uh east of CDO it's it's up north it's 
very north of red on the water of studio so it  
curves up that way from CDO right well yeah you 
got you got to follow the water uh yes right so  
you end up uh you end up there in a hook if you 
go into butuan right okay okay so anyway uh this  
we never talked about height okay so I met this 
girl blind kind of a blind date because we did we  
didn't even VC prior to meeting right okay and so 
I met her I did I met her I only saw her picture  
but we got along on chat okay so I meet the girl 
and man she's like four foot freaking six right  
her and her freaking sister she brought her sister 
with her and I gotta say like I was quite shocked  
because I look I teach and I teach elementary 
school students and she was smaller than my  
freaking she was like a grade four you know like 
in grade four and it freaked me the hell out  
and it's like I I'm thinking like right away I'm 
thinking like holy crap I gotta spend the entire  
day with her because I came all the way over here 
right and so we went around we met our uncle and  
whatnot and made a whole video about this exact 
thing but anyway I did like I got the hell out of  
there as soon as I could like I got the hell out 
of there I just could not get past her being four  
foot freaking six I'm six foot one she was like 
he was like down here it's like unbelievable it  
was like I could not I could not even hold this 
girl's hand without being embarrassed right so I  
went back home and we talked and I was nice to her 
and I was like I didn't tell her it was about the  
height thing but uh but the thing is it's like you 
know like you'll meet a babe and it's just like  
something will throw you off you know and I've 
met and I met girls like this like like if I meet  
a girl and if she's like what I call a Gucci babe 
like she's all dressed up she's got her makeup on  
and you know like this is a big turnout for me you 
know I like a girl I'd like a girl like I say from  
The Province but it doesn't really matter that 
thing is she is down with a Jollibee lunch okay  
she's just got her shorts on she's wearing her 
sandals she's got her counterfeit Nike t-shirt  
on that's the kind of babe I like no makeup you 
know she didn't do her uh Brazilian whatever on  
her hair you know she's just an all-natural babe 
that is exactly my kind of grit my kind of girl  
I I get you I get you um and we can go back to 
that in a few uh your preference for skin color
I would say uh the preference is dark but you know 
I wouldn't discount a light babe because you know  
for example there's two babes there right one is 
a dark-skinned but she's fat right yeah there's  
light skin but she's hot red I'd go for the light 
skin babe so my preference is dark my preference  
is dark but you know you know that mocha look 
that is the ultimate preference that's called  
the kayumangi look what does that mean it's the 
natural skin color of a Filipina uh and it varies  
in in several degrees from light but still had 
that bronze on them to a little much dark dark  
so okay that's that so when you when you when you 
talk to a Filipino and you ask them what their  
skin color is most times they'll say kayumangi 
is is the word that they that they use but it's  
pretty much interchangeable with Morena because 
that's the thing I think a lot of guys like I want  
a Morena chick what a lot of men don't understand 
is Morena is a variety of different spectrum and  
a lot of Filipinas are light-skinned but they 
never got their skin whitened but they just  
have lighter skin but that's still Morena but 
most most men um look at Morena women as like  
the Filipina P type of Morena women as they want 
and it's funny that you said that you know it's  
about beauty right skin you know the skin color 
dark but then fat skinny light skin it's about  
the beauty on attractiveness and I think that 
a lot of guys sometimes mess up where they just  
want to find a dark-skinned Filipina because 
that's what their vision of Filipinas are and  
it's unfortunate because they're losing literally 
about two-thirds of the Filipino race that are  
single Filipinas because there's there's a lot 
of Philippines who are skinny but they don't  
they didn't get their skin light and most of the 
time the dark-skinned ones are the ones that gets  
their lighters their skin lightened with products 
yeah well the thing is it's like like when I say  
you you probably have everyone has probably has 
five variables when they talk about a babe right  
it might be like the number one and the number 
five right and so anyway I was talking to this  
uh girl I met on date in Asia okay and so I I 
you know she has a tick tock so I was following  
her on Tick Tock well this girl is exactly my 
kind of babe I mean nice nice pair on her cute  
face good good skin rep man okay so we're about 
like two months into this talking thing right  
and it's it's a no there of course right and 
so anyway I see one pic of her on Facebook  
holy crap she's got giant freaking legs like 
twice the size of what I thought they were and  
it totally destroyed the whole fantasy of what 
I was thought I was talking to so that's the  
thing you know that's the thing like you could 
have the perfect babe but she her genetically  
is screwed up somewhere somewhere she's 
screwed up and that throws off the whole thing
