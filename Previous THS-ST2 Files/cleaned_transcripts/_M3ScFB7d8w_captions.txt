After trying Jollibee's and Max's chicken,
we wanted more Filipino food.
This is like the jackpot.
We got way more than they bargained for.
This is the large intestine of a
pork face.
Help.
Do you want more?
The portions were huge.
The service was crazy.
And Cebu’s famous lechon?
Well, it speaks for itself. Oh, my.
And then there was 
that one mystery dish.
I don’t understand what’s 
so chewy. 
Thank you.
Woah, hello.
Thank you.
Wow.
We're going to do the regular lechon,
a quarter kilogram.
Yeah,
Your lechon.
Wow. Thank you so much. 
When doing research for 
our Cebu food tour.,
The number one recommended
dish was lechon.
It’s very popular all over the Philippines.
But the way they make it in Cebu
specifically makes it
the best dish to try here.
So that's what we're starting with.
We came to Rico's Lechon,
which is a chain restaurant here in Cebu,
to try their world famous roasted pig.
At Rico's you can order by the kilogram.
So we ordered a quarter of a kilogram
to share.
It's probably a little small
for an actual meals.
I would say like half a kilogram
would be a good meal.
So the reason that Cebu makes it
the best is because they use bay leaves,
peppercorn, and lemongrass
to marinade
The skin and the skin is.
So look at this, it's so crispy.
It's like cracking. Oh, my God. Oh. Oh,
Mmm. Oh, shoot. 
That is good.
I love it.
It is really tasty.
The skin is so crispy.
And it has a nice layer of fat
right underneath it.
So it's like really juicy still.
And the flavors, I always hear lemongrass
and I think, like,
Thai food doesn't really taste like that
at all.
Just taste like really good, like,
barbecued skin.
I'm not a huge skin person normally,
but this is really good
Let me try this pork.
It’s more than just skin there
is actually meat here too.
Oh, my God.
That’s really good. 
Oh, it's like nice and moist,
really simple flavoring.
It's just pork, roasted pork,
but it is good.
It kind of tastes like on the pork
you would get like with carnitas.
Oh, yeah, this is good.
But it was
just like meat with a little skin on top.
But there's white and dark meat
and there's a couple bones in there.
So don't just, like,
inhale the whole plate.
So I put two sauces on the table,
one soy sauce, one
some sort of like tangy
Question.
What sauce is this? 
This is, uh, vinegar-based...
We made that for...
Lechon.
Oh, okay!
They’re so nice here.  
It’s like orange juice. 
One moment. 
It's like a spicy vinegar sauce that
they make for the lechon here. It’s very good.
Are you impressed that you can pull that
flavor out now?
Way to go.
What did you do?
That wasn't me.
That was not me. 
Oh, really?
So sometimes you have to choose
between noise pollution
and copyright.
Right now, we're choosing noise pollution
Topsilog. Right?
Is that what it is?
Topsilog. 
And so, yeah, we'll have that, please.
And then what do you want to drink?
The food took a really long time... 
Ow. I almost fell. 
Hi, kitty. 
Do not get my hair
caught in that.
I've done that like, multiple times.
Have you really?
It hurts. 
We're the only ones here.
We’ve been waiting for food for like
45 minutes 
45 minutes already.
They were waiting too...
No idea what's on this meat.
It smells like soy sauce.
Oh, that's really good.
It's so thinly sliced, and, I don't know,
it's got to be marinated in something
because it's a little bit sweet.
It tastes like it's
marinated in soy sauce,
and you get a hint of pepper when you
bite, and it's just, like, very juicy.
It's wonderful.
It reminds me of a Cambodian dish called,
and maybe if I eat more, it'll come to me.
Hey, I'll look it up.
No, I am still not a robot.
But what is in this first of all?
It's like garlic rice, a fried egg,
and then this is some sort of meat.
Woah, these are like fish.
Look at those.
Yeah, they're little uh... 
They have eyeballs.
Minnows. That's
what they look like. Like fried minnows.
It's some sort of fish.
I have no idea, but I'm going to try it.
Eyeballs.
It's not good.
Doesn’t it taste like 
beef lok lak, though? 
Oh, that’s good. 
It’s really good!
Yeah, it does. 
It’s like identical. 
It really is.
The dish we ordered is called
tapsilog. 
It's a combination of three words
Why can’t I zoom in on notes? 
Tapa + sinangag + itlog 
Tapa is the cured beef 
that’s served here. 
Sinangag is the garlic fried rice
and itlog is the egg.
I think they like made it right for us.
for the meal which is nice
Real garlicky flavor on 
everything. It's delicious.
All right. Let’s eat this fast
so we can leave. 
There are so -
We’re like getting bombarded. 
Like aerial assault,by these 
little flies. They’re not mosquitoes.
They don't bite,
but they're just obnoxious.
Wow, that was fast. 
Thank you.
Feels great in here.
I know there were so many.
What is your YouTube channel?
I will subscribe. 
Oh, you're so sweet. Very nice.
Our channel is called the passport couple.
The passport 
The third one right there.
Yeah,
Notification bell
Aww, you’re so sweet.
Thank you!
thank you.
I will watch later. 
Not while you were driving. Please.
This is our fourth ride today,
you have the best AC
by far.
Yeah, thank you! 
that's the sales pitch.
that’s how they get you in the door.
We’re at Pungko-pungko
To be honest, it’s not what
I was expecting. 
I thought It was like a market where you just
go to different stalls,
like order stuff, but it's literally
just like a big room with picnic tables
and then like a giant bucket of fried
food on every table.
You just sit and eat it. 
Do you need help? 
Noo...
You like you need help. 
I’m just here for the...
Lumpia.
Good? 
You want spicy sauce? 
Yes, please. 
You want gloves? 
Like this? 
Very nice. 
Thank you.
It doesn’t even have finger holes. 
It’s just.
Just a bag. I love it. 
Yeah,
that's great.
Basically,
all they have is fried food here.
It's just a giant bucket of fried food.
So we're trying Lumpia,
which is like the Pinoy
or Filipino version of spring rolls.
It’s minced meet inside 
or shredded meat.
Our coworker Lanny used to make these
for us for, like,
potlucks or special occasions.
So we've had really good ones before,
so I hope these are good too.
Also, we have a spicy sauce.
that's going to give me heartburn and
everything gives you heartburn.
That's really good.
Super fried and crispy on the outside,
nice and greasy.
And then the meat inside
is just like plain meat.
There's no like, extra cabbage or anything
else.
And sauce is definitely needed,
especially with the red onion and chili.
It's like a taquito.
Yeah, this is
the large intestine of a pig.
Very spicy sauce,
It’s really good. 
It honestly tastes exactly
like the lumpia. 
It’s just fried oil with something 
chewy on the inside. 
It tastes like chicken, right?
But it tastes like Lumpia.
You want as well.
Okay. Okay.
Allergy? 
No, no.
Great.
Thank you.
Thank you so much.
Yeah, I like the
fried pork belly the best.
It's the most, like, flavorful.
It's not just like, fried.
oil. My hand is sweating in here. 
We also got puso. 
Which is rice in these 
really cool coconut leaves.
They cook the rice,
they boil it inside the coconut leaves
that are all woven together,
and then you just break it open
and you have like a little bit of sticky
rice to go with your fried food.
Sticky rice. That makes sense
why it's finger food.
So yeah, I think that they
have two soft drinks here.
It's water. And Mountain Dew
in a bottle, like a glass bottle,
a proper glass bottle.
I don't think I've ever had Mountain
Dew in a glass bottle.
It’s so good, it’s so refreshing.
Here you go.
Thank you so much.
Wow, that was nuts.
The food was good, But I think honestly,
the more enjoyable part of that for me
was just the experience, it was...
clapping (general chaos)
Pure chaos in there.
Agreed.
But it was fun.
15-minute walk?
Yeah, let's walk.
We haven't walked
more than a couple of steps today.
So I think on food tour days,
we can always afford more steps
He got four?
Yeah, he likes them. 
We got some dog treats 
The other day and started 
carrying around when we travel
and we see a lot of stray dogs,
they're always so
hesitant about the first one, but once they
eat one, it's like they eat everything.
That was the first one I dropped.
He’s eating it only now.
Okay, bye, bud. 
Are you my friend now? 
Oh, hello. 
Look at that beautiful face.
Hi, cutie. 
I'll get a couple more for you, okay?
I have a problem.
He has fleas. 
He definitely has fleas. That’s 
why I’m going to keep him at a distance. 
All right, ready?
Here. Two more
There you go. 
You said two. 
Three more! 
we have a lot.
Oh, my God. You have a problem.
What are we going to name you? 
How about Tug?
Tug? That’s a good name. 
Tug.
See you later, bud. 
Oh, babe, stop it!
Get out of here.
Oh, my God.
Hi. 
Hi. 
So, for the majority of this food tour
so far, we've been sitting alone
and we've been do a lot of countries
in Southeast Asia.
And we're kind of reminded recently
why that is, because it's
it's 3:30 pm in the afternoon,
which is like peak heat of the day.
Once the sun sets and everything
cools down, everybody's out.
So all the restaurants
we're going to today,
if we came the evening time,
I'm sure would just be full.
But right now
it's just not a good time to be outside.
It's a good time to be inside
like in a hotel room
or a mall or anywhere but outdoors.
Thank you.
Thank you so much.
Ooh. Oh. The dish we
 got is called sisig.
which is a type of 
pulutan or beer chow.
So if you had too many San Miguel's.
This is supposed to help.
It looks like something
I would eat for breakfast.
It has eggs, minced pork, onions, peppers.
There was an egg here, but
I just chopped it all up and mixed it in.
And then to top it all off,
you squeeze some calamansi
juice on top of it, mixed in.
I feel like we've been eating 
breakfast all day today
Hold on. 
Not good?
something was weird,
but let me try it again
I don’t understand what’s so chewy... 
I think it’s just fat. 
It’s pig face, okay? 
It’s pig face? 
Yeah. 
Why didn’t you tell me that? 
I don't know. 
Okay, I'll be honest.
Alicia waited until after 
I ate it to tell me 
It's actually pork face, so I've had
a couple of pieces that are very chewy.
And then other pieces that are very soft.
And while, I know that's
the main component of the dish.
I like the rice, the egg,
the onions, the peppers.
That's all really good.
And it gets a very honestly,
it's just a traditional breakfast
that Alicia and I eat sometimes at home.
So that's excellent. 
The meat? It's okay.
It's okay. You wanna try a little piece? 
Oh, you can definitely 
taste the citrus on it.
Yeah.
Also, traditionally, this dish is served
on a hot plate and with beer,
but they don’t serve beer here,
so we didn’t have that part.
And it's just served on a plate.
I guess it just varies on how it's served
and presentation depending on where
you eat it.
Good afternoon.
How are you doing?
Hello, I’m fine. Going to Ayala? 
Yes. 
Our next stop.
Well, on Google now it says 
that it is permanently closed.
So we're going to detour
to the stop after that,
which is a very popular family
owned restaurant here in Cebu.
Should be a good alternative.
Oh, my gosh.
One of our drivers told us today that rush
hour starts at 4:00 pm. 
That was not a joke at all.
And I think we just caught that very,
very early part of it.
Just totally desserts me.
Look how happy she is.
Sorry about that
We’re at Cafe Laguna
inside the Ayala Mall. 
I don't think I've ever included
a restaurant in a mall before,
but in our defense,
we were talking to one of the breakfast
attendants at our hotel earlier
this morning.
We told them we are going to be eating
a ton of food today.
And he recommended that we come
to this mall and he's a local here.
So we took his advice.
This place has multiple locations.
This just happens to be one of them.
We also had a really nice taxi driver
point out
this mall specifically as something to see
and do in Cebu City.
So kind of two birds with one stone.
And I think malls are just part
of the culture here in the Philippines.
We got San Miguel Beer, Alicia ordered
the Pilsen and I ordered the light,
but they're out of it.
So I just end up 
getting the Pilsen, too. 
It’s a beer we’ve had 
before and we really like. 
And the reason I ordered the light version
is because it's
one of the only countries in Southeast
Asia that actually brews a light beer. 
They're very uncommon here.
They usually just have one local beer
and it's great in that’s it. 
which to me is what the Pilsen is.
Cheers. Cheers. 
I think this is one of my favorite beers,
especially in Southeast Asia,
but kind of all over the world. Plus, 
it also has a cute bottle like look at it.
It’s just all short and stubby. 
It's a good presentation.
It's cute
and it's been brewing for a long time.
Yeah, since 1890. A very long time.
I really never know how to describe beer,
but I feel like their bottle actually
does a good job of that.
A truly satisfying beer
with a refined, well-balanced flavor.
So that's what it tastes like.
Adobo. 
Oh my gosh, look at that.
Yeah.
Adobo
is like the most popular Filipino dish.
So we couldn’t do a food tour
in the Philippines without getting it.
Adobo is stewed meat in a 
marinade of soy sauce,
bay leaves, peppercorn, vinegar.
And it smells so good.
You had to wait a couple minutes
since this has come to the table,
and my mouth is just wandering like crazy.
It looks so good. 
It's like these nice 
little pieces of pork.
You can see some char on one side
It just smells so good. 
Mmm. Mmm. Mhmm. 
Woah. 
Good. 
That is so friken good. 
I love soy sauce.
And the soy sauce marinade just makes it
so salty and warm and delicious.
It's just like, so tender
It’s good. 
Beautiful. 
Very good.
It just melts in your mouth. Oh, my God.
Yeah. This is like the jackpot.
I think we saved the best for last,
thankfully.
And look at like this
presentation is so cool.
And look at like this
presentation is so cool.
You’re just eat it out of there? 
I can't possibly eat it from this. I
have to be a, like, civilized human being.
Second dish is kare-kare.
It's a stew with beef,
peanut sauce, vegetables,
and it's topped with bagoong,
which is a fermented seafood paste.
I don't know if I said it, but peanuts
because you can smell the peanuts
from the moment it gets to the table.
All right.
I'm trying it
Without the fermented seafood paste
first.
Oh, my gosh. That's really good.
The peanut sauce comes through
really nice.
The green - are these green beans? 
Looks like it.
Yeah, the green beans are very fresh.
Very delicious.
Nice crunch.
And the meat just sitting in a stew.
Very, very tender.
Time for some seafood paste.
Probably not that much. Fermented
always means really powerful.
So I'm going to proceed
with a little bit of caution.
and put this on lightly. Is that lightly?
That is a lot. That's a lot. Okay.
Is that okay?
Yeah, I think it. Yeah, that's good.
All right.
Bok choy here.
You’re still chewing? 
I don’t know why I take
such big bites, but 
I don't know.
I don't really notice the difference.
It tastes saltier to me.
Maybe I didn't have enough.
I think you're supposed to put, like,
how much you put on your first bite.
Like, on, on all of this. 
On all of it? 
Yeah and mix it together,.
Do you want to try it? 
Yeah.
Woah. 
What? 
I don’t like it. 
It’s so strong. 
Help. 
Okay, that is an acquired taste, one
I doubt I will be acquiring anytime soon.
I remember I actually had fermented
shrimp paste in Vietnam,
and I say that it was like a fish
just punched me in the mouth or something.
I still stand by that.
I just got punched in the mouth by fish.
It's funny because a lot of 
people in that video said
that you're not supposed to just eat it
straight up and you're not.
But we just wanted to understand
what we were tasting
because there's a lot of flavors
and some of these dishes.
So you don't necessarily know
when you've never tried something 
before what it tastes like.
So it's a strong thing
to taste on its own,
but we definitely know what
it is when we taste it. Now.
Mmm! The garlic rice is good. 
Honestly, rice is usually just a side
and just a little bit of an afterthought.
Not from the restaurant, but from us.
But as garlic rice is excellent, like
we have some really good food on the table
and we're choosing to just devour
the rice.
Okay, so
we wanted dessert,
so we went to this place
that's supposed to have
a really good version of this dessert,
but they didn't have it today.
Then we went back to the restaurant
that we had dinner at and got takeaway
because we didn’t want to sit down again.
Oh, babe!
What? 
Look at what you did.
Oh, my gosh! 
There's liquid in it? 
Oh, my gosh. My bad. 
Who just throws a dessert when
they don't even know what it is?
I thought I looked in
the bag.
You recked this.
Did I really? 
Look at it. 
Oh, it’s not that bad! 
That's all supposed to be together.
What is?
All the little bits and pieces.
Ladies first.
We haven’t even said 
what we're eating.
Oh, we're eating flan.
Leche flan.
Which is Spanish. 
It is Spanish. It's
very popular in Mexico, too. Yeah.
Even though we didn't eat it there. 
No, we didn't.
I don't know if I've ever had flan.
I have. I’m curious what you think.
Mm hmm. It looks very good.
It looks like good flan.
Oh, that's like caramel-y.
Mm hmm. Tastes like.
Oh, my gosh, That is so familiar.
Yeah, it tastes like a like a yellow cake.
It's like a butterscotch candy.
It's like butterscotch, right?
It's like syrupy.
There's orange in it, too.
Do you taste a little bit of the orange?
Yeah, it is like a little citrusy.
There is some citrus in there.
There is a candy that I had growing up.
I think it was like Halloween
or Christmas.
I know those are two very different
holidays, but it tastes just like that.
I just can't put my finger
on it or tastebuds, whatever.
That's pretty good.
Very good.
I like it. 
I do too. It’s super sweet. 
Yeah, I couldn't eat, like, three of these.
No, I'm glad we shared.
I could probably eat this on my own
though. Yeah, it's good enough.
It's small and it's small enough.
Delicious. Mm. You want more?
I'm going to have Oreos and
milk after this. 
That was good. 
That’s the vlog. 
That’s it. 
Bloopers. 
really peeling back the onion. 
the curtain?
Oh, my gosh.
Are you okay? 
Yeah. I’m good. 
Thank you.
