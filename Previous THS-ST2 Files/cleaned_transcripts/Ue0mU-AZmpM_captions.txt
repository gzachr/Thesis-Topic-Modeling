- Found the area where this
American guy that seems
like he's really struggling.
Hey Daniela.
Today, we're going to go
out and hand some more
Tsinelas out to kids.
Can you grab some for me?
- Oh, yes, sure thing.
- Okay.
Daniela, secret camera man,
grab some more yourself and let's go.
What's wrong?
I need to give you a warning.
Don't start a business.
(relaxing music)
- In a lot of other episodes
we've talked about things
like how to start a business,
what you need to know
before you start a business,
on and on business, business, business.
The reason why I wanna talk
in this episode about
why you should absolutely
not start a business
is because there's far
more reasons why you
shouldn't than why you should.
What about that business over there?
The press.
Are they open?
Are they closed?
It's kinda hard to tell.
You know, most businesses
don't make it the first year.
And out of those that make it,
almost all of them are out of
business by their fifth year.
Why is that?
Why is it that people that were
so excited and so passionate
about starting a business,
once they actually
start, rarely keep
going for the long haul?
(relaxing music)
The second reason why
you should absolutely not
start a business is because
you want more free time.
I think a lot of people think
that business owners have all
the free time in the world
because other people are
doing all the work for them.
Of course, people who run a
business that have employees
are very fortunate to have
other people helping them,
but honestly, I gotta
say that it was years
before I had a whole week go by where
I didn't work seven days a week
and often very late nights.
Having a business meant
that I worked far more
than I did when I had a nine
to five kinda job before.
If you're the owner, if you're the boss
you gotta first be boss of yourself.
And if anything needs to
be done that wasn't done
during regular work hours,
guess who's gonna stay
after work each day to
get everything done?
You are.
We spotted the pandemic Batmobile.
Batman had to downgrade.
Lines, lines lines.
Only in the Philippines.
(relaxing music)
- May I ask where we could park?
- At the back, sir.
At the back.
- For the farmer's market?
Okay.
- Yes.
- Okay.
- Right there on that corner there.
Yeah.
- Okay.
Salamat, sir.
(relaxing music)
- So, we're down in Carbon
Market today in the Colon area.
It's one of the oldest
markets in the Philippines.
A lot of people come here to sell fruits
and vegetables that come from
the provinces and other areas.
We're trying to find an
American businessman that we
saw that was down here.
Just has a really small business.
Seems like he's really struggling,
and so we're hoping that we see him
while we're down here today.
We might be able to help.
We also got some of our sandals.
Tsinelas as they call them here.
And we're hoping to give
them out to some of the kids
around here that need a
little bit of help as well.
Let's go.
(upbeat music)
- That's a lot of nuts.
So, we found the area where
this American guy that seems
like he's really struggling normally is.
And the local vendor said
that he only comes here
every once or twice a week.
And it looks like he's not here today.
So hopefully we'll have
better luck next time.
(upbeat music)
- You should also absolutely
not start a business
if you're the kinda person
that gives up easily.
Look at all the people here
everywhere at Carbon Market.
They're pushing heavy things
like this guy right next to me.
They're out in the heat.
It doesn't smell really great here.
They're up from early in the morning.
They don't always make
a lot, but they're still
working hard to make it happen
no matter what it takes.
If you're the kind of person that is
easily discouraged or that easily gives up
you absolutely should
not start a business.
(relaxing music)
- You want a slipper?
You're welcome.
There you go.
(relaxing music)
- Hold on one sec.
Stay there.
(relaxing music)
- You're welcome.
You're very welcome.
There's always more sandals
that need to be given out.
No matter how many I bring,
they always go pretty quickly.
But we'll do the best we
can each time we come out.
Let's go.
I'm good.
Are you good?
I'm good.
It's always a pleasure when
you can help somebody out.
Even if it's something
just small and see a smile
on their face, seeing them
wave goodbye over there.
There's always so many kids
that have a need out here.
And so, sandals is one
practical thing that I find
that I just keep in my car and
whenever we're out and about
we always try to load up
some more to be able to
help the kids that either
don't have any shoes
or sometimes you can
just tell their sandals,
they haven't had a new pair
for a really long time.
So, you know, even now as I'm talking
there's a few more kids outside
of the door that want more.
We gave out dozens of pairs today
but unfortunately we'll
have to come back again
to give to those that we
didn't have enough for today.
So, the fourth reason that you absolutely
should not start a business
is if you're the type
of person that wants
to just start something
and not keep working to
improve it day after day
after day.
In order to be really
successful in business
you have to keep iterating
which means you have to
see how things are working,
how customers are responding,
and then you need to make it better.
You need to improve.
I recently got this invitation to connect
with this guy, Tom Balmont
out in England, on LinkedIn.
And I love this guy's profile.
It says that, well, this is his hook.
He says, bringing brands to life
with humor and puppets.
After all, who doesn't like puppets?
And then his tagline
is, on the other hand.
Get it?
He's a puppet guy.
You know, someone like this,
it's just kind of silly
but it made smile and
almost made me laugh.
And I think that when people
are always thinking how
they could better connect
with others in a way
that's gonna really meet
people where they're at
they're gonna keep improving and improving
and they're gonna have
a successful business.
So, if you're the type of
personality that isn't persistent
and determined to always keep learning,
and even if you fail
you're gonna learn from
that failure and keep going,
you absolutely should
not start a business.
(slow music)
- You're probably expecting me
to give an encouraging twist
at the end where I tell
you that you should
start a business after all,
but I'm not gonna do that.
Well, I kinda wanna do that,
but I'm not gonna do that
because it's really
important that you think long
and hard about the decision
of starting a new business.
There is so many rewards.
I wouldn't change a thing
if I could go back in time,
but that's because it's
something that I'm committed to,
I'm passionate about,
I'm comfortable with making
mistakes and learning them.
And because of that, business
is a great option for me.
Is starting a business
a great option for you?
Let me know what you think
in the comments below.
As always, thank you for
taking the time to watch,
and I look forward to
hearing from you soon.
Take care.
