you've been brushing up
on your language skills,

Guess That Translated Disney Song.
- I speak muy poquito español.
(chuckles) That's about it.
- I'm pretty fluent in Spanish.
- Oh!
- Oh, no.
- I listen to a lot of Disney songs.
- Oh, no.
- (FBE) I'll play you part
of a Disney song that is
in a language other than English.
The person who gets the name
of the song and what movie it's from
gets a point.
- Got it. I'm taking French.
And I'm half-Dominican,
so I've heard Spanish around me,
but I can't really speak it.
So, we'll see how we do. (chuckles)
- (male speaks foreign language)
- Huh?
- What?
- HUH?!
- (male speaks foreign language)
- I have no clue at all. (chuckles)
- I think there would be some type
of beat to it so then I could be,
like, "Oh, okay. It's this song."
- (male speaks foreign language)
- Wait! Yeah, I know what this is.
I think it's "Gospel Truth"
from Hercules when he's all like,
"You go, girl."
It's like the (vocalizing).
And then, they start.
Am I right?
- (FBE) You are not right.
(buzzer)
- What?!
- It's like "Welcome to" something
from Princess and the Frog.
(buzzer)
- No?
- Maybe we should do more time.
- (male speaks foreign language)
- Yeah, that didn't
really help for me.
- It sounds like
a villain song, though.
- That's hard!
I have no clue.
- (chuckles)
- I feel like a failure right now.
- Okay. Is it--
- Take away my Disney+.
- "Gaston"? Right?
I really hope that's the name of it,
'cause he says his name
the whole time.
And then Beauty and the Beast.
(buzzer)
- (FBE) Nope.
- You're joking!
- This is a different song.

- It's the song I'm thinking about it.
- Oh! Oh! Oh!
- I just don't know the name.
- I know it. I know it. I know it.
I know it. I know it.
It IS Beauty and the Beast,
but it's "Be Our Guest,"
not "Gaston."
- (FBE) That is correct.
(ding)
- YES!
- Good job, dude.
- Thank you. Thank you.
That was a whole struggle.
- (FBE) "Be Our Guest,"
Beauty and the Beast.
That is correct.
(ding)
- Yeah.
- Wow! All right.
I'm not trying to get zero.
- It's probably the ♪ (hums) ♪
I was like, "Oh! Yes!"
- I don't think I have it.
- (FBE) Okay. Well, let's--
- I've heard it.
- (FBE) "Be Our Guest,"
Beauty and the Beast.
That is correct.
(ding)
- YAY!
- (FBE) And for a bonus point,
do you think you know
what language that was?
- I don't know. (laughs)
- German.
- (FBE) Yeah, it was.
(ding)
- Whoa!
- Whoa. (laughs)
- German?
- (FBE) Yeah.
(ding)
- You're joking!
- Fire!
- Ahhhh!

- Uhh...
- It sounds very Disney.
Like... (laughs)
I mean, no doubt it's a Disney song,
but I'm gonna need three seconds.
- ♪ (piano music) ♪
- No.
- (sighs) I feel like guessing
at one second is so hard,
'cause you don't get much
out of it. (chuckles)
- Yeah, you can't get
a feel for it.
- Mm-hmm.
- (FBE) Should we just
move on to three seconds?
- Yeah.
- Yeah, I feel like it's
a safe choice.
- Yeah. The piano key
isn't doing it for me.

the chorus to that song.
I cannot tell you how it starts.
- I wanna say it's either
Chinese or Japanese.
- Yeah, I was gonna say Mandarin.
- (FBE) It was Tagalog, so...
(buzzer)
- Dammit! My friends
are gonna be so mad.
- (FBE) Frozen, Tagalog.
Jayka, you got two points on this!
And Tyler, you got one.
It was in Tagalog.
- What?!
- (FBE) Yup.
- Wow!
- What language was it?
- It's Tagalog.
It's a Filipino dialect.
It's the most common one.
My family, we don't even
speak Tagalog.
We speak a different dialect,
but it was pretty surprising
that I knew that.
This song is so overplayed,
and I don't know why every
five-year-old memorizes
every breath of this song. (laughs)

- No. I'm so sorry. No.

But you'll have to
keep playing for sure.
I need three seconds.

I know it.
Wait, can I just hear three seconds
just to be sure?

want three seconds?
Okay. (chuckles)
- Yes, please.

- Yeah.
- Oh. All right.
I guess I lost that one.
- (laughs)
Here's my guess.
- (FBE) "Reflection," Mulan.
Yeah, you got it right!
(ding)
- Okay. (laughs) Nice.
- ♪ (female singing
in foreign language) ♪
- (gasps) Oh.
Oh my god.
I know this song.
I need to go through
every Disney princess, though,
to find it.
I think it's Pocahontas,
"Paint With the Colors
of the Wind,"
so I'm gonna guess that one.
- (FBE) You did not get the point.
(buzzer)
- God dang.
- I thought it was Ariel,
"Part of Your World"--
"Part of"--
I don't know what the name
of the song is.
(buzzer)
- Oh, shoot.
- I didn't have a guess.
- (FBE) Jayka, you said
"Reflection," Mulan.
That is correct.
- Yay! I love, love, love this song.
This was THE song.
- (FBE) Any idea what language?
- I have no idea.
- Go with French.
- (FBE) That was in Italian.
(buzzer)
- (laughs) Lucky--
- (FBE) It was a good guess.
- Is that when she's
wiping off her face?
That's literally
what was in my head!
That's so upsetting.

- (laughs) I'm like,
see both of us process
that second
we just heard, like (squeaks)

- It's really hard to tell
with the first second, because it's
just a different language...
- Yeah. (laughs)

to process that.
- Oh, wait. I know that.
Oh, play the three seconds.
I know this song.
- ♪ (man sings in foreign language) ♪
- I think-- I don't know.
It sounds familiar.
I'm gonna need
a little bit more time, though.
- So, if we guess the movie
but not the song,
no points?
- That's no point.
- (FBE) No point.
- All right.
- But if you wanna guess the song,
I'll finish it with the movie.
(laughs)
- I don't even know the song. (laughs)
- ♪ (man sings in foreign language) ♪
- Yeah. Okay.
I know the language too.
So, I think the song
is called "Alley Cat,"
and I think it's from
the Aristocrats,
and I think it's French.
- (FBE) Nope.

too deep into the Disney archives.
I feel like these are more mainstream.

Oh, I know it.

I'll guess French.

Wow.
- (FBE) Tyler, you've been really good
at guessing languages I feel like.
- I know! What the heck?!
I'm not even paying attention
to the languages.
- Is it "Cruella de Vil"
from 101 Dalmatians?
But then, is it French?
- (FBE) Yeah, you got two points.
(ding)
- YES!
- (FBE) "Cruella de Vil,"
101 Dalmatians, French.
You got two points on that,
because you got all of that correct.

I was like, wait.
I'm trying to sing it in my head.
And I was like ♪ (hums) ♪
♪ No evil thing will ♪
- When he says, like, 'blesse'
that's like pain or like cruelty
and stuff like that,
so it's like 'Cruella du blesse.'
So, that makes sense.

The American education system
really came through.
♪ (indistinct music) ♪
- Yeah.
- What?! (laughs)
- That sounded like static.
- Yeah! (laughs)
It was like white noise.
♪ (indistinct music) ♪
- That was a wind chime, man.
- Yeah, all of these
are just instruments
at the first thing.
- I wanna say it reminded me
of a movie, but I'm not sure.
It's kind of a guess.
- I heard the water,
so I'm thinking Moana.
I think.
♪ (tranquil music ramps up) ♪
- Maybe. Let's see.
- Maybe. If it's wind chimes,
then I think it's one
of my earlier guesses.
- I think you and I
are thinking the same thing.
I guessed "Colors of the Wind"
from Pocahontas.
- So did I.
(buzzer)
(gasps)
Whaaat?
- Bro, that's not okay.
What is this?
- I think I know it,
but I need to hear more to be sure.
I'm pretty sure I do.
- It takes me usually five seconds
or whatever, around then,
to know what it is.
♪ (tranquil music crescendos) ♪
- (FBE) Did that help any more?
- Yeah. Not with the language.

"How Far I'll Go," Moana.

Oh, this is so upsetting.
It's so new.

It's not coming.
- Of course I know it.
One of my favorite songs.
- I don't think I have a guess.
- It's Moana.
- Moana. "How Far I'll Go."
(ding)
- (FBE) "How Far I'll Go," Moana.
That is correct.
- Yay! Moana is--
She's a queen!
- I knew it was Moana,
but I don't know the names
of the songs,
and that's just what
gets me every time.
- Japanese.
(buzzer)
- (FBE) Nope, this was Spanish.
- Ah! I would've gotten it.
I know the song in Spanish.
- To be honest, I feel like
I wasn't even listening
to the language.
I was just trying to pick it up
from the background. I don't know.
It could be anything.
- You got the iconic ones, though.
You got Frozen and Moana.
I got everything in between.
- What does that mean, though?!
That means that I'm just a fake fan
who watches the mainstream ones.
Like, come on.
- (FBE) So, with a final score
of 6-1, Jayka, you just killed it.
(ding)
- (both chuckle)
- I literally have playlists saved
of Disney music.
- Yeah!
- Good job, Anthony.
- Thank you! Thank you!
- Well deserved.
- I could've done better.
I think if the score was closer
at the end of the battle,
then I think I would've
been more in tune with it.
- I really enjoyed listening
to "Let It Go" in Tagalog,
because that's, like, my culture.
Those are my people.
All these Disney movies
are just so worldwide
that everybody knows them
in their own little language.
Like, people don't even know it
in English, and they'll know it
in their own language, which is cool.
