hey guys i have a very
important question what the hell is
cheesecake
is it this or this maybe that one or
maybe even this
no seriously what is it you see i wanted
to develop a cheesecake recipe for you
guys but right as i sat down with grace
who's been a producer here on the
channel recently we couldn't even agree
on what a great cheesecake should even
be and it didn't take long to figure out
why she is from toronto canada and i am
from berlin germany and we grew up
eating two very different things that
both happened to be called
cheesecake so we kept digging and
discovered that with countless varieties
all over the world cheesecake is more of
a very loose category rather than
one fixed dish so instead of giving you
that one
perfect cheesecake recipe here's what we
decided to do
we picked five cheesecake recipes from
different parts of the world and
different periods in history
using very different techniques and we
decided to try every single one to see
what we like about them and what we
don't and that turned out to be a really
educational experience like one of the
things we found out for example is that
eating five cheesecakes in a row
not as good as it sounds we're gonna
walk you through all of the cheesecakes
we made and we'll share what we've
learned and we're gonna break things
down into four major categories
the cheese the filling the crust
and the method and of course we're gonna
tell you how they taste
our goal is to take the best parts from
all of these recipes and then make a
follow-up video where we make
the world's perfect cheesecake but for
that we're gonna need
your help now of course everyone's taste
is different we are just three people
over here but you guys
are from all over the world so while we
make the cheesecakes please let us know
in the comments what you think of each
one
and what the perfect cheesecake should
look like in
your personal opinion oh and very
important please also add your country
of origin so we can do a little bit of a
fun data analysis
all right i hope you're ready because we
got cheesecakes to make
so to kick things off we really wanted
to go back to the roots and start off
with
the earliest recipe for something like
cheesecake we could find and
boy did we find something turns out the
oldest mentions of cheesecake
date back to ancient greece where they
were enjoyed by the original
olympian athletes to get all of their
macros in i guess
this og cheesecake was both sweetened
with and also soaked in honey and that's
because honey is
pretty much one of the most ancient ways
we as humans know
to preserve food and yes these cakes
were sitting around at room temperature
duh no fridges around at that time and
eaten like that
not warm at some point the romans got
wind of the greek sweet secret and it is
them
via a blog post that we found that gave
us a recipe for
sevillum by the way you'll find all the
recipes that we used in the description
below so yeah these first cheesecakes
were made from
fresh cheese think along the lines of
queso fresco paneer
maybe ricotta aside from honey only some
grains and then later on eggs were added
to the mix
then there is no crust i guess the crust
hadn't been invented yet
and then the whole thing is getting
baked in a clay pot type of situation
before getting drenched in honey
so let's find out what an ancient
cheesecake tastes like so i figured if
we make an ancient cheesecake it would
only be appropriate to make the actual
cheese from scratch and that is exactly
what we did we used
goat milk for an extra rustic ancient
feel and even though i do not like goat
milk i'm doing this for you guys
now normally raw milk is best but all i
could get was pasteurized which is
not ideal but it still works you need to
get that milk nice and hot first
and then use an acid to make it curdle
and separate
in the beginning not very much was
happening and i thought this was gonna
fail but
after about an hour of resting and then
squeezing everything out through a
cheesecloth we
actually had ourselves a pretty good
looking freshly made
almost ricotta style cheese it had a
pretty intense goat cheesy smell at this
point which you might like if that's
your thing but i was
not very excited then to our homemade
ancient fresh cheese we only added
ingredients that really could have been
around millennia ago we even used spelt
instead of wheat that just felt like the
most appropriate
ancient choice the dough is spread in a
round pan and baked into
phases first covered with aluminum foil
to sort of simulate that clay pot
and then again with the cover off the
cake looked pretty
flat until it suddenly started puffing
up forming
almost a browned bubbly skin the best
part is
definitely drizzling everything with
much needed honey
and garnishing with poppy seeds towards
the end
a truly truly wholesome cake no modern
mambo jumbo
no instagram compatibility and after one
full day of resting this cake looked
well
just as unspectacular as it did before
which makes me wonder
can this possibly taste good
i have no idea what to expect ancient
cheesecake
let's go it's not bad
it's not really what i would expect from
something you call
a cake this homemade goat cheese pretty
good actually
it's not very sweet actually i'm glad we
drizzled some extra honey over there
sometimes when you get these middle
eastern pastries that are filled with
feta cheese
that is what this tastes like it tastes
very wholesome
i feel like you can eat like one entire
piece of this and not feel like you're
about to pass out but yeah who am i to
complain this is a 3 000 year old
cheesecake so
it's pretty good for that
yeah looks like a brick going on i feel
like this is a diet cake
it does have a very strong goat taste
yeah i agree it's like a diet cheesecake
but it makes sense because
olympians ate this they ate this before
their race or whatever so then it gave
them extra energy
so i can see why this would be an
athlete's cake
it just tastes too healthy i guess
so i guess that cheesecake must have
tasted amazing back in the day because
the romans managed to popularize this
type of dish
all over europe the oldest mansion on
the english language side of history
dates back to 1390 and it basically
never stops from there
all over europe fresh cheeses cultured
cheeses and
cheese curds were baked into some sort
of cake they also got more and more
refined over the centuries we get
the great invention of the pie crust for
example then at some point sugar becomes
available and
cheap in the old world which was huge
for cheesecake makers
but each region did develop their own
version and that is important
now fast forward to me growing up in
germany in the 1990s where there was
definitely a very popular and
traditional
german keizer kuhn or cheesecake and it
looked like this
the most important feature here is that
the cheese foundation is made from a
very common german fresh cheese called
kvac clark is traditionally made with
the help of
soured milk essentially and that makes
it a very tangy product it is also
pretty low in fat which me like but that
traditional german kesaku and i showed
you before that's not really the one i
want to talk about the one i want to
talk about is actually called
rooster which translates to something
like
russian pinched cake i guess and at
least when i was growing up it was huge
in germany it was
everywhere and especially in the form of
a store-bought
cake mix i guess but here's the thing
this cake has
russian in its name and i was like wait
a minute
i am russian so is my family and neither
of us has ever heard of this so-called
russian
cake well turns out the company behind
that store-bought cake mix actually just
was sent the recipe by
a customer and then turned it into a
product in the 90s
and that russian part was supposedly
only referring to those little pieces of
chocolate dough that looked like
apparently the domes of russian churches
um
i am not buying it because that
certainly doesn't explain
this very famous ad they ran where a
voice over with the worst russian accent
ever
shamelessly tells some bs story about
their uncle michael
my point is they just made it up that is
not a russian cake i repeat that is not
a russian cake
but i can't deny that it's a pretty damn
delicious cake now because this is such
a well-known recipe over here we decided
to follow the best rated recipe from
this
big german recipe platform which looked
pretty much spot on if you ask me
it uses the same lean but deliciously
tangy clock as a
cheese base among the things that kind
of give it a little bit of body the most
notable one is the addition of vanilla
pudding
powder like a custard powder then for
the crust just like many of its european
cheesecake cousins
it uses a shortbread pie crust and then
you just
give it a good old bake in a cake mold
so nothing complicated here so ladies
and gentlemen this is what i grew up
believing to be a very
classic form of german cheesecake first
of all i gotta say
kudos to the person that came up with
the original cake idea
you pretty much just make regular short
crust aka flour sugar and butter
but because you also add some cocoa
powder to the mix
you turn it into delicious chocolate
short crust that
could also just be cookie dough while
that's resting you make the flavored
cheesecake base which i always thought
was pretty lean but
turns out you still add copious amounts
of butter and sugar so yeah
none of that the recipe also called for
custard base like pudding
which was basically vanilla flavored
corn starch but
alongside a couple of eggs this gives
the cake its body one of my favorite
parts about this recipe must be the way
the crust is made so you roll out
two thirds of your dough but while i
originally thought you didn't have to
like transfer it into the pan hole
grace actually showed me a high quality
oma technique where you just
tear off these little pieces and nestle
them into the pan
which works much better than it sounds
after you pour in the filling you then
take the leftover one third of the
chocolate dough
pinch off little pieces and top the cake
with them that's what supposedly gave it
its original name
plucked cake you can add as many pieces
as you like but i like keeping it just
decorative only because i prefer for my
cheesecake to be
well cheesy it takes roughly one hour in
the oven
in total and then a lot more cooling
time because this is one of those cakes
that really gets better overnight
but trust me that weight is worth it you
can eat this cake straight up but if you
want to be extra decadent
top it with a dollop of whipped cream
and you know at least visually this
undoubtedly meets my personal german
cheesecake criteria but
the question is how does it taste
this looks hardcore promising so let's
try
very hard to beat after eating that
ancient cheesecake i was like i don't
know if i want to taste four more
but now having tasted this i'm looking
forward to tasting three more
the vanilla flavor is extremely
pronounced what i really
love about this is that the cheese
itself
is actually pretty lean it's not super
fatty it's like
it has that leanness of german clock
i love the combo of that chocolate
cookie
crust and the cheese it could be more
lemony that's what i think it's missing
the cheese filling itself super moist
dense but juicy
i love this this will be hard to beat i
need i need your
opinion i'm just gonna go in um
cheesecake
so much better than i expected really it
looks so dry
and i'm not a huge fan of like chocolate
but this has so much like
vanilla flavor in it this one has a
better balance between vanilla and
chocolate
to amplify the tanginess of the quark
you can
add lemon juice or zest yeah but it's
difficult enough to finish this
piece right i'm almost done okay that
was delicious but i feel like there
cannot be a cheesecake video
on this internet without mentioning the
one the only the world famous
new york cheesecake and i have a perfect
example of that

did i just say that thank you sir shark
for sponsoring this video and now
new york cheesecake so let me give you a
heads up
new york cheesecake is completely
different from its european namesake
its origins are their own little story
even though some parts are a little bit
difficult to back up
apparently everything goes back to the
invention of american style cream cheese
like
philadelphia in the late 19th century
it was originally meant to be a
replacement for a french fresh cheese
called nerf chatel
but then they went all american on it by
adding more cream and
that's pretty much how that was born and
around the 1920s
a legendary new york restaurant owner
named arnold rubin developed a recipe
for a cheesecake
based on this new ultra rich dairy
product now when it comes to the details
of how to make new york style cheesecake
that is an entire rabbit hole you can go
down but
fortunately for us tasty actually has a
really well made video on
exactly that so we decided to just use
their
ultimate new york cheesecake recipe it's
got that american cream cheese space
along with
more cream the whole thing is held
together by a ton of
sugar eggs and just a little bit of
flour then it has a
cookie crust very intriguing
the whole thing is baked in a water bath
which is kind of a pain so
let's see if it's worth it so this is my
very first time making new york
cheesecake guys so please wish me luck i
gotta say
i think the idea of a cookie crust is
absolutely genius
why bake a crust when you basically
already have it
you just need to rearrange it although
shaping this type of crust is definitely
something that does require some
practice at least
if you like it even fortunately we're
only doing a bottom crust and not the
sides so
you just bake that off to help it firm
up and get toasty
yeah genius i'm telling you but when it
comes to the filling i
can't say i am equally impressed it's
packed to the brim with cream cheese
and sugar and more cream which yes of
course it's gonna taste super decadent
and rich but
come on i want to be able to walk after
i eat a piece of this but looks like
that is not going to happen today and
then about that whole
water bath thing it requires you to wrap
your cake pan in
foil so water doesn't lock the cake
which is pretty fussy and wasteful so
not a fan of this to be honest the goal
is to create a layer of steam i guess
around the cake during baking which will
supposedly allow it to gently come up to
room temp
without cracking or browning and my
question is first of all i don't know
what's so bad about these things
and secondly both of these things still
happened to the cake
but they just made it better in my
opinion now with this one as well you
just have to wait until the next day and
leaving this in the fridge without
touching it is
i think definitely the hardest part of
this recipe to be honest
the upshot is though you will be
rewarded the smoothness and texture of
this cake
is out of this world we topped it with
watered down
seedless gem which surprisingly worked
then fresh berries
and mint like the fancy people we are
and this was truly a picture-perfect
piece
of new york cheesecake
you can hear how rich this is listen
it's good i cannot imagine any scenario
where anyone will call this
bad so it is definitely
very soft and tender it's richer you
know it's like
fattier and you can taste it it tastes a
lot like cream cheese
and if you ask me that's great if you're
eating a bagel but if you're eating
something sweet
i'm not actually a huge fan of that like
very
kind of creamy dairy note so
i don't know i still prefer the german
quark as a filling
crushed great the flavor from those
crackers
really good i must stop
your turn wow like it's somebody's like
it reminds me of home and my mom and i
would always have tea time
and it's like a black tea the cheesecake
with extra fruits and berries and then
it's like extra special
so and it tastes like this it tastes
like this i think the cheesecake alone
would be too sweet for me
but in combination with the fruity
toppings it's perfect so i understand
right now it might seem like
cheesecakes are a very european a
western thing right
no actually wrong in the middle east or
in india for example you can as well
find like really traditional versions of
cheesecake and even as far east as japan
people have been playing around with
that concept for centuries
but it was definitely the influence of
american soldiers after world war ii
that would eventually spark a true
cheesecake craze
in the country and ironically it was the
german cheesecake keizer kuhn which
we've covered before
that inspired a japanese baker to
develop what would become that classic
airy
soft and wobbly japanese style
cheesecake
actually i remember back when i lived in
shanghai i was really craving cheesecake
because there wasn't a lot of that stuff
around
in china so one day this japanese like
really famous cheesecake chain
opens a store next door to my house so i
stood in line
over one hour craving something like
cheesecake but what i got
was by far the worst cheesecake i have
ever had
in my entire life to this day it was
like
a cheesy sweet cloud of eggy butter fat
so needless to say
japanese cheesecake i don't get it and
yet here i am
making it for you to be precise we're
making a variety
of the japanese cheesecake with matcha
we found this youtube video that looked
pretty solid
and thought what could go wrong but
little did we know in terms of cheese
this one also relies on
american cream cheese but it's the very
ambitious amount of eggs that really
provides that you know classic lift and
of course this version also has
matcha added in it what it doesn't have
is a crust so it's just an
eggy cheese cloud back to the roots i
guess and in terms of technique this one
also uses a water bath but a more
complicated version so yeah
japanese cheesecake let's do this so i
really felt like this was the fussiest
out of all the cheesecakes
so many complicated steps i always get
super nervous when i use water baths
because
somehow that usually means failure is
imminent i also really can't get over
how many eggs are in here we're almost
in like souffle omelet territory and
then the recipe called for cake flour
which i had to make myself with
cornstarch and all-purpose before
sifting it to avoid even the suggestion
of lumps in this
delicate cake and by the way matcha is
great and all but to enhance that green
color we also added some
chlorella completely optional excuse me
but i got thumbnails to make but yeah
the work didn't stop here
whipping eggs to soft peaks is key
because japanese cheesecake is all about
that airy texture
that's what sets this cheesecake apart
from all the others that are
definitely more on the dense side of
things just like new york cheesecake
this one went into a water bath the
dreaded water bath
to then get baked in two phases and guys
i don't know what happened in that
youtube video the cake puffed up
beautifully but mine not even close
i feel like it must have been karma
actually i talked so much smack about
japanese cheesecake in this video
that it just decided to stay sad and
flat i actually had to take the
temperature of this cake which was
well over the setting point for all the
ingredients so i just had to accept the
sad truth
that this was a completely failed
attempt you know even after a full night
of resting this cheesecake did not
magically improve
and when i cut it open i could see that
basically only a small portion on top
puffed up while most of the cake just
turned into a wet
matcha cheese jello but since i already
spent so much time making this
i guess there was no way around it
so i'm not gonna lie after having that
piece of new york cheesecake just now
this looks a little bit underwhelming
maybe
i'm not going to call it a total failure
before i try it
a lot denser than i thought it would be
delicious this is very bad
i i don't know where we went wrong so
this is what we got and
i don't know i guess you can imagine
what this tastes like the sweetness
level is pretty good here
it's a little less sweet than the others
which i actually enjoy
and i'm assuming the entire cake is
supposed to have
this texture rather than this so i think
that bottom part is
no bueno but that top part pretty good
guys you should try this it's really
delicious come come first
we were all rooting for you it's not
cream it's like more more paste i'm very
sad
like it could be fluffier so this is
like halfway there
and so this is like the whisper of what
it could have been let's pretend that
never happened
and try the next one shall we
so there was one last cheesecake we
really wanted to try and that is a
filipino
ube cheesecake similar to japan
cheesecake caught on in the philippines
with the help of american influence but
being very adept at mixing
foreign food influences with local
tastes filipinos gave the cheesecake
their own spin
by adding ube what is ube
glad you asked this is an ube it's a
starchy tuber from the yam family and
stands out due to its beautiful color
which only intensifies after cooking and
gives every dish it's used in
a vibrant purple hue in the philippines
ube
cakes no cheese have been well known
desserts for a very long time so
making the jump to an ube cheesecake was
really not a stretch
we found a food block with a pretty
promising recipe and
decided to give it a shot like so many
before it this cheesecake contains a
whole ton of american style cream cheese
the hegemony of american cream cheese i
don't like it but then of course the
addition of a whole ton of ube halaya or
ube jam
is a key feature here it then uses a
similar cookie style crust like the new
york cheesecake
but this whole recipe is a no-bake
recipe and that's a whole huge entire
category of cheesecakes
that i am very excited to try the only
downside
outside of southeast asia ube is pretty
much just
unavailable period even in the
philippines many people resort to ube
extract or frozen graded ube and if
you're lucky you might be able to find
that around
but in my case i decided to go a
completely different route and use
purple sweet potatoes i know they look a
little bit similar but
being much sweeter they are not actually
a great replacement for ube but they do
bring the color
and also the idea of adding sweet
potatoes to cheesecake seemed
super interesting the color even
intensifies further when you bake them
making the experience of working with
them
like really oddly satisfying so to make
this replacement version of a filipino
ube jam we followed all other steps as
closely as we could
and putting my blender to the absolute
limit we made a delicious
coconutty rich super sweet and
beautifully
purple spread i passed that in extra
time for smoothness and got myself
a lifetime supply of sweet potato jam so
the crust here was pretty much the same
as for the new york cheesecake but this
time things didn't really
work so well and honestly i'm not quite
sure why
it's also much harder to make a bottom
and the sides rather than just a flat
bottom layer of crust
might have been a good idea to bake this
for a minute or two to firm up but you
know i want it to stick to a fully
non-baked recipe there's just something
magic about no-bake cakes to me but
there are definitely risks involved
clearly i was wondering how simply
mixing together mostly cream cheese
sugar and my
sweet potato jam is supposed to hold the
cake together
there were no fillers like flour or eggs
which would require
heat and um turns out my intuition was
right
even after resting the cake in the
coldest nook of my fridge overnight
it came out beautiful but dangerously
soft but you know what yolo right so i
spread a healthy amount of coconut
flakes on top for that
extra filipino touch and you know what
you can't really
argue that the color here isn't
intriguing but
can this extremely unstable floppy cake
taste any good
so under normal circumstances i'd be
pumped
to eat this like simple but beautiful
cheesecake
the problem is i just had four pieces of
cheesecake yeah grace has passed out on
the couch so
let's try this now this is still
a little bit too sweet for my taste and
it's gonna depend
on how sweet your ube jam is but i think
the addition of sweet potatoes using
sweet potatoes to make cheesecake
is genius and something i think we
should pursue
further no but this is definitely by far
the the softest cheesecake amongst yeah
that is true it is very
very soft if we did it again i would not
add the sugar
no extra sugar it's way too sweet right
now but if we reduce the
the sugar and just use the sweetness of
the sweet potatoes then i think it's
gonna be pretty we all like the sweet
potatoes in there right
yes yes yes all right well thanks guys
thank you okay so here's the deal we can
literally not eat another piece of
cheesecake for
the next few weeks but i'm hopeful that
that's gonna come back sometime
soon and that's when i wanna come back
to this topic take the best of all
worlds and combine it into
one new cheesecake this channel's
cheesecake oh and in case you're
wondering you know for today my personal
favorite
still the german one but obviously this
is not just about me i want to know what
you guys think so be sure to drop a
comment and let me know
what the specs for your perfect
cheesecake are
with that being said i hope you learned
something in this episode and i'll see
you
in the next one cheers
