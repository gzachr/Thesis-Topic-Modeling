so today we are here in bgc one of the most 
requested places for me to visit here in manila  
we are starting here in high street and we're 
gonna make our way up after a coffee of course  
to the venice grand canal mall which is very very 
popular and maybe a must see for us on our visit  
here in manila and this is insane let's go let's 
explore and let's see bgc so welcome back to my  
channel or welcome if you're new here my name is 
josie welcome to my channel so we're here at bgc  
and this just feels so new so like brand new like 
fresh but first we've got a coffee from sunny's  
cafe and it's really pretty in there everything 
here is so aesthetic everything looks brand new  
everyone here is so stylish as well like there 
are big brand names here there are like tgi  
fridays starbucks like all shopping as well but 
i think we're gonna find more of that later on  
um but right now first impressions of here is 
incredible funny story about nike is michael  
went into the one in the philippines where was it 
it was like cebu and he went to buy the shirt and  
he didn't try it on anything because generally 
speaking he's always the same size in nike no  
matter what country or anything like that but 
this must have been uh philippines this must have  
this must have been philippine sizes because 
it kind of looked like a wetsuit on him  
it was super super tight it was like a skin suit 
i look like catwoman so i got it but look at it  
if you like it tell me in the comments 
below should i keep it is it mine now  
let me know so there's actually so much here 
like there's all of these shops and all these  
plaza sort of things down that way it's really 
pretty all of the greenery all of the like  
fontune lights over the top like connected to 
the trees and everything it's really nice here
so i had a lot of you telling me in my comments 
that you know bgc area you told me to come here  
first of all but then you told me that it's all 
you know upper market sort of shops skyscrapers  
like really tall buildings obviously i know that 
not every place is like this or anything like  
that in the philippines so we're just walking 
and we saw at least four to five men with like  
leaf blowers on their backs and they're just like 
leaf blowing all the roads so that's probably  
explains why it's quite clean okay so while we're 
walking the longer walk than i expected towards  
them all i just want to let you know that i'm 
currently at the time of filming this on about 44  
000 ish subscribers so thank you to all of you 
who have subscribed already but i have this  
really big goal of hitting 50 000 subscribers so 
if you haven't subscribed already please hit the  
subscribe button and help me reach my goal if you 
want to if you don't that's totally cool but that  
would really help me and make me really excited 
before i leave the philippines to hit 50 000.  
so like that button like press the like button 
and the subscribe button while we're on the way  
to the mall right now and that will really help 
me hit my goal before i leave thank you everyone  
whoa i fell with how long this walk is taking 
you might hit 50k by the time we get there yeah
so we've just finally got here 
to the venice grand canal mall  
and this is insane i can't believe it 
i've been to actual venice in italy so oh
well they just dropped their hat 
but also there's water out there
you know what it honestly kind of does look like 
venice but kind of cleaner when i was there when  
i was there the water was so like brown and 
spoiler if you haven't been to venice it smells  
a lot nicer than venice here too it did sweat have 
you been there yeah oh yeah same wow and the blue  
the water is so blue like obviously you've seen 
people who have come here before on youtube right  
and i've seen the video but it looks really 
really different in real life like it looks  
so pure you said it was dyed it i reckon it's 
dying it might be done it's dyna it's got a  
chemical in it for sure or something to make 
it really clear but it's um it looks a lot  
different in real life than it even does on like 
youtube or videos you live there wow yeah there's  
like apartments up there and that looks straight 
down onto this that would be a really cool spot
so there's a part over there that's 
like outside near the water so we're  
just going to head up and over this like uh 
bridge and go over to that side over there  
there's a bit more sun so on the top of the 
bridge here and everyone seems to be getting  
photos looking down onto the thing not a 
bad idea actually it's really really pretty  
but it's back down that way and then on this side 
is a part i think that is like kind of more in the  
open yeah we'll go down here and have a look this 
is the water right behind me and even from this  
angle it's like pure crystal clear blue oh don't 
want to get too close and drop my camera in there  
this is awesome there are a lot of people here a 
lot of people taking photos um but it's a really  
cool it's really nice it's outdoor so that i 
actually honestly kind of thought that the sky  
in other people's videos and things were was like 
like fake like i thought we were inside but it's  
actually real like that's the actual sky might 
sound silly but this is really cool looks like  
you can have gondolas to go around with where 
someone's like pushing the gondola around with  
you on it or you can get these swans and i think 
you just go on those and paddle yourself i think  
and i've got like really cool stores here as well 
like tj fridays like other like phone stores other  
food stores this is really cool a cool selection 
of stores we haven't gone this is we literally  
walked in it's the first thing you almost see so 
maybe we should have a look around for the rest  
of the mall then maybe come back here at the end 
look at people down there having the gondola ride
like venice yeah
so we went out the back and there was like this 
people setting up for a concert and there was  
music playing it was for maximilian i don't know 
who they are but we looked them up they've got  
a few you know listens on youtube but anyway so 
we're looking through and it seems as though most  
of the things are happening just around the like 
water the shops themselves seem to be quite quiet  
um so maybe this just seems the place 
to be getting like your instagram photos  
but it's really cool so we decided that since 
we're here we may as well do something that all  
of you have been telling me to do since we first 
got here in the philippines let's try hello hello  
the day has come all right let's order
okay all right thank you all right we're going 
somewhere else for hello hello so we're here now  
at inner cell because the other one was out of 
hello hello we've got it here now before i even  
look at what's actually in it to me it looks like 
trifle if you've ever had a trifle we have it in  
australia sometimes um but you've got looks like 
to be jelly like cherries a lot of shaved ice  
and then like ruby ice cream and then some kind 
of like beans and then also like a bready thing  
i'm not actually sure so i think it's tagalog for 
mix which is just like a mix of different things  
like fruit fuve ice cream shaved ice coconut bits 
um sago siago kidney beans and a whole bunch of  
things in there as well so i'll get some of the 
like cherry stuff give me everything all right  
sorry i've got a big spoonful jeremy smells 
like cold just like i said ice cream all right
i'm so cold i got a big taste of that like 
blueberry ice cream like it pretty much just  
tastes like um but i've got these like little red 
cherry things in my mouth a little bit chewier  
so they kind of like stay there after the ice 
cream's melted the ice so cold on your teeth it's  
like a little like a brain freeze it just honestly 
like the ube is really taking over like i'm just  
tasting the purple ice cream but the jelly like 
having all those different like textures and like  
elements in there it really reminds me of trifle 
like we have trifle at home my mum makes it it's  
like layers of like custard and like biscuit 
like i don't even know what else is in there  
but it kind of reminds me of that just like a 
mush of things but i kind of like it it's nice  
and cold it's like refreshing because i'm really 
hot okay i have a question i've seen so many dogs  
with nappies on can someone tell me why the dogs 
have nappies on is it just because they're out  
in public so you don't want to like pick it up i 
need to know do they go in the nappy or fashion  
statement we don't that doesn't happen at home 
really like hardly ever i've never seen it before  
and almost every dog i've seen in this shopping 
centre has one on so tell me in the comments  
so it's getting a little bit late now a little bit 
dark outside what we're going to do is we're going  
to walk out of the mall and we're going to walk 
up just a little bit because we did see a night  
market just literally on the edge on the end of 
this mall but up a little bit so we're going to  
go there and see what there is so on our way out 
we asked the security guard where the outdoor is  
it mercado mercado mercado market was which is 
the one we're going to check out and she said  
it was closed because of the maximilian concept 
we saw earlier we didn't believe her so we went  
again we went to have a look for ourselves but 
it does look like it's closed i think that's it  
i don't think that's over there i don't think 
that's what we came apart no we're a little  
bit lost we're trying to figure it out to the 
main road and see if it's just on this side  
okay so we found it we walked all this way 
we found it but it is definitely closed  
it looks so cool too it's definitely closed it's 
for the maximilian concert that we saw earlier  
everyone was there apparently that person 
didn't start like two or three more hours  
and people were already like lining up waiting 
there for them so anyway tell me in the comments  
do you like maximilian was it worth it because 
i would have liked to get some snacks right now  
but everything's closed 
there's nothing here at all  
there's nothing here okay so unfortunately we 
couldn't get any of the street food here which was  
we're gonna show you i'm now i've been to italy 
is it is that is it just like italy not really  
but is it really cool yes like you know what i 
mean they've gone into all this trouble of like  
putting all the gondolas and like even the guys 
dressed like him would dress like the guys in  
in venice so it is super cool it doesn't a 
hundred percent have the italian vibe but  
they've tried really hard and is close enough 
it is so beautiful it's pretty what more could  
you want lots of instagram photos it makes for 
a really pretty picture um but make sure you do  
like and subscribe like i said i have this goal of 
hitting 50 000 subs we're back in manila um so if  
you could please make that happen for me before i 
leave the philippines that would be a dream come  
true but i've got two videos on the screen for 
you right now if you love this video i know you'll  
love them so go check those ones out after this 
one's done and i'll see you in the next one bye
i don't know why today
