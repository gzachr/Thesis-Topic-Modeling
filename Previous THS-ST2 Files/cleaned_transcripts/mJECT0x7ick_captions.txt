So for today's vlog, po,
As you could see,

and you could see "upgrades" each vlog, right?

J: But we're honestly freezing here.
L: So, today, Jenny and I have someone to interview.
 J: She visited us all the way from...
Her name is...

Micah: I have you guys' coats with me. 
L: We really made our guest carry our stuff. 
J: Oh, we're sorry.
L: She's our guest and yet we made carry our coats. 
 So, guys, this is Micah, my friend.
All the way from the Philippines.
L: Hi, Micah!
M: Hi, Louis and hi, Jen!
Thank you for inviting me on your channel!
J: Oh btw, this friend of mine is
a commercial model.
L: Someone's passing by and looking at us again.
J: We're sorry about the passersby
J: So we have questions [for Micah]
J: No beating around the bush anymore 
J: We'll ask her questions right away. 
J: So what commercials have you been part of, sister? 
I started casting when I was in high school
but I stopped because 
my mom wanted me to focus on my studies. 
So I came back to it
when I graduated from college
So my first ever commercial is
for a fast food
Disclaimer!
Sorry, if I mention any brands. 
I might get in trouble.
Jollibee, you could maybe sponsor us too.
M: Then I got hired at a local airline
in the Philippines
then I stopped again
then I came back to it again
after 6 years of stopping!
M: So when I got back,
I got a project from an ice cream company, 
which is the Nestle Temptation
M: Sorry, another disclaimer!
J: OMG, "beke nemen" Nestle [sponsor us, Nestle]
L: We'll attach the commercials.
M: Second is, Alaska milk.
J: Omg, "beke nemen" Alaska.
M: Then after that is with the BPI family bank.
I was only able to count four red cars.
M: Make sure you eat your lunch, okay?
M: Then my latest one is
M: Megaworld
J&L: Wow, Megaworld!
M: Actually, I've never seen it yet.
M: We filmed it before the pandemic that's why.
And then I never saw it anymore.
L: Wow, that's so cool!
M: Hey, I'm not a celebrity. I'm just a...
M: Okay, I should probably show you
how the whole casting works.
Like how the auditions.
J: Okay, game.
M: One is the "yes" acting.
L: Okay, yes, let's do it.
M: Okay, so for example
M: the director asks you to 
Just like that.
L: Jenny, copy her.
L: Okay, how will Jenny say yes in a happy way? 
L: Look at the camera.
L: Did she pass?
M: Yes!
L: So how about sad?
L: Oh, like that.
L: How about Jenny?
J: Wow, that's sad?  
L: How about scared?
M: Okay, scared.
J: It seems like she saw a ghost.
M: I have a third eye?
L: How would Jenny do it?
J: Hold on, I can't hold my laugh.
L: She's scared, but she's still laughing.
M: And then, angry.
L: Omg, she's so good.
J: She's so good!
L: I really got scared of her.
L: How would Jenny do an angry "yes"?
L: Oh, so that's how auditions work.
M: Yeah, like that. 
J: Can we do copy your steps earlier?
J: Like, just queue us and we'll do your steps
J: since we saw it from the Nestle commercial earlier.
J: This step.
J: So how much did you get paid for that commercial?
J: That's the real question.
J: Guys!
J: You could just give us an estimate.
J: estimate
J: EST
M: Five digits.
J: Wow, five digits!
J: Just by doing this [dance]!
L: I'm so amazed to meet someone
L: who has done TV commercials.
L: After the "yes" acting, what else are part of the auditions? 
M: Okay
M: The director will have a short list
M: of those who passed the "yes" acting.  
M: Then, they will do what's on the story board. 
M: Each one will try to impress the director
M: through dancing and acting.  
J: Will I get in if I do this, Micah?
M: Yes.
M: Momsh, no, what really happened was
M: the music played 
M: and then
M: I was really shaking my hips like this
L: We really have no shame and don't care about the people passing by. 
J: So, I'd really pass---
M: They're not part of the auditions. 
J: But, how did you sign up, like audition   
J: Like, how did you find out about auditioning for TV commercials?
M: Because when I was in high school,
M: I got discovered at the mall
M: by an agency.
L: Wow, she got "discovered"
L: and by an "agency"!
L: S, the agent just approached you?
M: Yes, when I was at Time Zone [arcade] playing
J: Every time our family goes to the mall,
J: we usually go to the arcade zone.
J: Why didn't we end up in an agency?
J: Why weren't we discovered?
L: But she got discovered.
L: Must be nice!
J: So you were just doing this and got discovered?
M: Momsh, no. I was playing the Dance Revolution
M: and he saw my facial expressions.
M: I was so into the game/dance that time!
J: How do you do it again?
J: How? Show it again. 
J: How do you do the steps?
M: I was doing these steps 
M: while jumping and laughing
J: Oh no wonder why this is my favorite from Nestle.
J: Did I do it correctly?
J: This part of the commercial?
M: You go up first, then down.
J: Next question is
J: Have you met a lot of celebrities already? 
L: Oh yeah, who did you meet already?
L: became friends with?
M: Marian Rivera.
L: [Isn't that you, Jenny?] 
J: Omg.

J: You've already met me before?
M: Yes!
J: Don't be a kill joy, sisterets! ;)
M: Jolina Magdangal.
L: Oh yeah, she was with you in the Alaska commercial.
J: Ah, Jolens.

M: Your husband.
L: Oh, so most of the ones you met are from the GMA network.
L: So, do you prefer GMA or ABSCBN network?
M: Uhm...
M: Hm, how do I answer this?
M: I might get in trouble by my agency.
L: Uhm, we'll just censor your answer.
M: Okay, [bleep]
L: Same!
J: Bleep.
J: So now, sister,
J: would we have to pay for your talent fee today?
M: Omg, no! Hahaha
L: In case you're expecting for a "five digit" talent fee.
M: Omg, no, I wasn't.
M: But you guys could seriously audition.
J: Kidding aside, I actually saw
her BPI commercial
on Facebook
I was like, "Omg!"
I texted her, 
"Sis, commercial---you're already a celebrity!"
M: Noooo
J: She's really humble.
L: I agree.
L: No, I love, I love her.
L: She's so humble.
L: She's super nice!
M: Omg, I literally just washed your dishes.
M: I was also just always lying down.
L: She really likes---
J: She seriously likes lifting/carrying [our stuff at home].
M: Don't be shy.
M: If acting is really your passion, go for it
because in TV commercials and acting,
it's not about the looks, 
it's the character that they always look for.
J: So I could really get in?
M: Yes!
L: Yeah, I think Jenny is gonna---
J: So, I passed [the auditions]?
J: So, if they tell me [to dance]
J: I will do this, my favorite.
J: Like that!
L: So, how do we do it? 
J: So, just act crazy, like that?
L: So
L: how much again?
L: Five digits!
L: We may earn five digits too Jenny [from that dance].
J: Omg I hope so. That would be nice.
J: Go!
L: What I call her is "Ms. BPI."
J: And "Ms. Nestle"
M: Momsh, you forgot to do this step.
J: Whoops. Okay.
J: Okay, how again? Show us.
M: Like this.
L: How did your hair look there?
J: Ohhhh
J: Oh, since it's Alaska milk,
J: it should show strong bones.
M: Yes!
J: Mommy, mommy!
M: Mitchy, here's your lunch!
