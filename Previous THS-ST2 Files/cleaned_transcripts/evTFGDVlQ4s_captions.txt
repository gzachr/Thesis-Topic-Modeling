We're trying to see who people here would pick as the prettiest...
...of these past winners of these beauty pageants and why
Alright
Okay, C is beautiful!!!
Yeah, C, beautiful!!!
Why, why?
What's going on everybody?!
How the heck are ya?!
That's right, we're back!
With another...
Xiaomanyc...
Special!!!
Today...
That's right, we're back here in New York City's...
Times Square!!!
Now, you guys remember
That amazing video
That we did
A few weeks back
Asking Americans here in New York City's Times Square
To say who they thought was the most beautiful
Of a list of Filipino celebrities
And so I thought I'd do something interesting
A little similar, but also different
You know, in the Philippines, actually...
Beauty pageants are extremely popular
There's many people in the Philippines who have won
These international beauty competitions
And actually the Philippines has a huge international standing in these competitions
And does very well every year
Basically what I thought I would do is take the most recent winners of the Miss Universe and Miss International contests
And take them to people here in New York City!!!
And see who people here would pick...
As their own most beautiful pick!
We've got...as our A...
Catriona Gray
For B...
We've got Pia Wurtzbach
For C...
We've got Megan Young
For D...
We've got the amazing
Kylie Verzosa
For E...
Bea Santiago
And for F...
Lara Quigaman
We're gonna take them to people here
And see what [people] would think about them for the first time
See who they would pick as their own most beautiful
Of these beauty pageant winners from the Philippines 
And it should be really exciting
And so we're gonna do our own little mini beauty pageant here today
With strangers from all around the world in beautiful Times Square
And if you guys like these Filipino videos remember to subscribe
Are you guys ready for this?
You guys ready for this?
This is gonna be good
This is gonna be really good!
Three two one...
So the Philippines does really well in these competitions...
And these are six of the past winners of Miss Universe and Miss International contests
From the Philippines
And so we're interested in seeing who people here
Would pick for themselves as the prettiest of them and why
Okay, umm...
I personally find her really pretty
C? [Megan Young]
Girl: Yeah
Xiaoma: Why?
Something about her eyes are really nice...
She has really nice lips
Okay
And her face structure
I like A! [Catriona Gray]
A, yeah
Her eyebrows, and her face structure
Nice
She has a pretty nose, too
Nose, yeah yeah
And we want to see who people here would think of them as the most beautiful and why
Alright
I think she's really pretty
C? [Megan Young]
She's pretty!
Xiaoma: B? [Pia Wurtzbach]
Girl: Yeah, because...  
She looks very like...old-fashioned
Her hair is nicely curled
And the...red lipstick and gold, I like it
I think she has really pretty eyes, and she just looks very like...
...beautiful
Awesome!
Yeah
What do you think?
Me? That's a good question...
For me it's probably...
I would say D [Kylie Verzosa] to be honest
Yeah, I thought about that, [she and Pia Wurtzbach]  kinda look alike
A little bit, yeah
She just has like that really like...
That stare, that look...
Really fierce...
I love her hair
Yeah, so that would be my pick
I think she's the prettiest
C? [Megan Young]
Yeah
Why?
I don't know...she has really full lips
And her eyelashes...
I don't know!
That's totally fair, yeah!
And her hair is pretty
Hair, yeah, I love her hair too
I'd have to go with C too
Same reason
Do you watch Miss Universe, or Miss International?
Yeah
Okay, cool
So...
Do you recognize any of these people?
Left: She looks familiar...
Right: Only this one...
E? [Bea Santiago]
But I don't know them
What I'm interested in seeing is who people here...
...personally would think is the prettiest...
Is the prettiest?!
Right
Oh god, damn...
They're all from the Philippines?!
Yes
I don't know, they all look alike...
To me...
C [Megan Young] stands out because she has her hair up 
She's the only one that has her hair up
But like, they all have the same eyebrows
Same eyes...
Maybe...
I don't know!
So C... [Megan Young]
I would say E [Bea Santiago]
And maybe B [Pia Wurtzbach]
Yeah, those are like top three, top three
If you had to narrow it down to two...
To two?!
Oh my god, okay...
Just say your top two!
Okay okay okay
Definitely C [Megan Young], alright one
And then B,  I wanna say? [Pia Wurtzbach] 
B...
Yeah
Why B?
I don't know!
I don't...
I don't wanna say it...
Her cheeks?
I don't know, I like her...
Her bone structure better
Like, if [Bea Santiago] had dimples, then maybe...
If she had dimples?!
I guess, yeah!
Alright, that's all
Cool, B and C! [Wurtzbach and Young]
Well, hmm...
C! I'd say C! [Megan Young]
I like D!
Yeah!
Okay, why?
You're just drawn to her, I don't know
Okay
I don't know
[Bea Santiago] is beautiful too, but she looks a little more...
Made?
These two kinda look more...
...natural...and her!
She's beautiful as well [Lara Quigaman]!
I would stick with D [Kylie Verzosa]
She looks like Snow White to me
With the red lips, and the dark hair!
She looks like...what's that?
Lily Collins [English-American actress]
She reminds me of Lily Collins, but...
Asian!
Cool!
So essentially...
I watched your YouTube video
Yeah!!!
Oh my god!!!
Did you let someone try the Jollibee?
I did!
See, I watch you!
Yeah, I saw you, both of you!!!
Do you recognize any of these people?
Ah man, I actually don't...
Okay...
Honestly, I'd go...
A [Catriona Gray], looks the most natural looking
Natural, yeah
To be honest
Cool
Yeah
Sweet!
I'm gonna make sure to get my mom to subscribe
Yeah, subscribe! 
Basically I have a big YouTube audience in the Philippines 
And so one thing about the Philippines is that they're really good at beauty pageants
So they win a lot of these contests
So what we're trying to do is so who people here would think is the prettiest to them
And why
I choose her! [Kylie Verzosa]
D? Why?
Just her...just the pose, the background, her makeup...
This is hard, they're all really pretty!
I mean, she's obviously the most natural right there... [Lara Quigaman]
Yeah, she won the 2005 contest
So this is a later Instagram photo
C is really pretty, I like those brows! [Megan Young]
I think her too!
A, you think A? [Catriona Gray]
Yeah, I like...I don't know, like...
Her...hair, and how it's like on her face
Right, right
We're trying to see who people here would pick as the prettiest...
...of these past winners of these beauty pageants and why
Alright
Okay, C is beautiful!!! [Megan Young]
Yeah, C, beautiful!!!
Why, why?
I don't know, something about her eyes...
Like her nose...
Like her facial structure's just like very...
Like her nose and her lips
Yeah, everything just works for her
Really, cool
They're all incredibly beautiful, but there's something about her...
[Speaking Spanish]
I would say...
F, for me!
Yeah, why?
Because she looks more natural!
Love it, yeah!
Yeah, cool!
Right off the bat...
My eyes go on F for a reason [Lara Quigaman]
I can tell that all the rest have makeup on
Yet she's still pretty without makeup!
Really? Really?
I like her the best
Cuz she's not wearing makeup and she's still attractive!
Wow
I'll say one of C or D [Young or Verzosa]
But...
Why?
Probably mostly...
Mostly her!
C?
C, yes
Why?
I don't know, it's hard to explain why she is more beautiful than the others
She looks the most Russian!
Maybe...
She looks more, uh...
Wholesome, yeah
She is very kind, very trustworthy
Super nice, absolutely
People really loved Megan Young
I don't know man...
There's just something about her, the look...
Especially the girls, I think, really like...
Something about her!
The style, the...cheekbones... 
Just...yeah, I don't know
Honestly though
I really do feel like all of them are really beautiful
And I think really represent this Filipino beauty
Love you all, from my heart!
See you next time, bye bye!
