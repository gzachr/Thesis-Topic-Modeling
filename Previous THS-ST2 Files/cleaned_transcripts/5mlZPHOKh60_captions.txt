why is it more cool in the Philippines
that's easy because there are so many
incredible experiences you can have here
and Beauty everywhere you look
welcome to this week's Philippines
travel Vlog we're Matt and Danielle from
couples Quest and we're here to tell you
about the best tours that you have to do
when you're in the Philippines
in no particular order let's get started
say
it's more fun in the film
our journey starts in one of the most
beautiful places we've ever seen this is
so hot on Cove and it's not only
beautiful but home to one of the most
unique and out of this world experiences
you can ever have but more on that in a
moment
to get to sowaton Cove you have to take
a two and a half hour boat ride from
Chicago Island but once you're there
it's worth every moment
is a group of interconnected Natural
Pools located in bukas Grande in Surigao
Del Norte it's full of beautiful islands
and one Unforgettable experience
[Music]
swimming with thousands upon thousands
of stingless jellyfish is something we
will never forget it feels unnatural and
strange at first as the jellyfish bump
against you but once you put your head
under the water that all changes
swimming through all these jellyfish
felt like something from another planet
it's an amazing experience and one you
can only have in very few places in the
world
Cottages we just finished some amazing
food this little Seaside town in sahaton
is awesome we absolutely loved it and we
just spent a little bit of time jumping
off this so let's go
is small but incredible you can stay
here for a few nights and one of the
rooms opens up right on the high jump we
wish we'd known about it beforehand we
would have loved to have stayed here
[Music]
Palawan is home to our next few tours
that you cannot miss in the Philippines
this is our private tour around the
breathtaking islands near Quran
we're at Twin Lagoon it is it's stunning
insane I don't want to leave it's so
beautiful
[Music]
as well as twin Lagoon there are places
such as the beautiful bannel beach and
one of our all-time favorites green
Lagoon
this lesser known Lagoon is amazing to
Kirk around as well as swim snorkel and
explore it's stunning and not to mention
incredibly fun
yeah
go
look at this water
can't stop saying how beautiful it is it
is so beautiful
day what a day
just your average Friday in the
Philippines
thank you
[Music]
if you're looking for a way to get
between Quran and El Nido then look no
further in at number three we have the
remote island hopping tour around
Palawan
look at this paradise
this is my favorite one so far Palawan
is such a fantastic part of the
Philippines home to the most amazing
Islands beaches and lagoons that you'll
likely ever see
this remote three-day island hopping
Expedition does not disappoint
[Music]
as well as exploring the remote Islands
in Palawan you will also meet a bunch of
friendly like-minded explorers jump swim
and live out the adventure of your
dreams
[Music]
ever wanted to spend the night on a
private island this is the perfect
opportunity
Little Beach hook are you excited yeah
is our tax egg the island
Welcome to our crib
just checked into our little mini
Paradise for the night how cute is this
foreign
it's a one-way trip and we went from
Quran to El Nido but you can also do it
the other way around
the alternative is a five-hour ferry so
if you have the time this is definitely
an experience you want to add to the
bucket list
three books with Bill hate Isla but
there are also a bunch of other
companies you can book with
[Music]
when you get to El Nido there is more
Adventure that awaits foreign
in the morning it's super quiet here at
Big Lagoon it's probably the best time
to come there is a couple of other
kayaks but this is probably the quietest
you'll get it maybe
yeah but we were one of the first boats
to leave the port in El Nido yeah
yeah we were the first to go a small
little boat so it took a little bit
maybe a little bit longer to get here
yeah but um but yeah we we left at the
first
so quiet it's
it's beautiful
[Music]
so beautiful
[Music]
coconut time
good
welcome to interlude Island
[Music]
may just be the most incredible Island
that we've ever seen
foreign
papaya Beach was our final stop on a
remarkable tour around the islands near
El Nido
[Music]
how good is this
it's a super fun beach where you can
spend your afternoon relaxing swimming
snorkeling and sipping a few beers
[Music]
welcome to canyoneering
canyoneering at kawasan Falls in Cebu is
one of the most fun days you can have in
the Philippines
it's an adrenal impact day that starts
with zip lining and leads to falling
backwards down natural water slides
cliff jumping and jungle trekking
it's so much fun we wish we could go
back and do it all over again
not only are the jumps awesome but the
whole time you're jumping walking and
floating while surrounded by so much
natural beauty
I just want to say hashtag it's more fun
in the Philippines yeah it is the
highest jump is a 10 meter platform near
the end which is the biggest jump Daniel
has ever done look how well she did
foreign
[Music]
the largest jump used to be 15 meters
high however a typhoon knocked some
large rocks into the pool at the bottom
so that's now too dangerous and off
limits
[Music]
laughs
while you're in Cebu you have to make
your way to the Sardine run in mobile
this is where millions of sardines form
the largest school of fish we've ever
seen
down and seeing thousands of fish form
in a circle around you is just magical
foreign
diving down and swimming with all of
these magnificent fish
seeing all the sardines move as one is
fascinating
although technically not at all this is
still an experience you definitely
should not miss
we completed our free diving course in
Mobile and it was unbelievable
Danielle and I are both Advanced scuba
divers but we had never gone very deep
on a single breath before we knew it we
were holding our breath for over two
minutes and on the final day we both
managed to dive to a depth of 18 meters
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
it was such an incredible experience and
one that really showed us what we're
capable of when we push ourselves
[Music]
[Music]
all right
[Music]
we hope you enjoyed our top seven tours
that you cannot miss in the Philippines
we loved every single one of these and
we know you will too
see you next week for more couples Quest
Adventures
