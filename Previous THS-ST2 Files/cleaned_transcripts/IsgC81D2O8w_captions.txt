That looks good.
Ube?
- Ube ice cream?
- [Vendor]: Ube.
Okay.
I just noticed this, guys.
I'm actually on the lookout for some lunch,
some pancit, some noodles,
here in the Malate area
of Manila, Philippines.
- [Vendor]: Malate.
- Yeah.
But I seen this.
I'm looking for pancit,
but I seen this and I can't resist.
- Yeah, ube, yeah.
- [Vendor]: Ube, mango.
No, only ube.
Yeah, I only want the ube one,
right here. This purple colour.
How much is one -- is it in a bun?
- [Vendor]: Bread.
- Or a cone? I will take the cone, please.
- [Vendor]: Cone.
- Cone, yeah.
- How much is one cone?
- [Vendor]: 20.
20? Okay, it's very good.
20, that's like... 36.
36 cents, 35 cents, something like that.
It's pretty good.
Hi. What is this, eggs?
- [Vendor 2]: Quail egg, yeah.
- Ah, no, it's okay.
I don't have the appetite for that.
I'm gonna go eat pancit,
I'm gonna go eat pancit.
Hi.
- Okay.
- [Vendor 2]: You try.
Okay.
No, no.
- I don't have the appetite for this.
- [Vendor 2]: Just one only.
Little, what are they? From bird?
- [Vendor 2]: Yeah, small bird.
- Small bird?
- [Vendor 2]: Yeah.
- Ah.
- [Vendor 2]: How about balut?
- They're boiled or what?
[Vendor 2]: Boiled, they're boiled.
- Already boiled.
- [Vendor 2]: Yeah.
I don't know.
[Vendor 2]: It's good for health.
- Good for health. Oh, okay.
- [Vendor 2]: Yeah.
This is from quail?
- [Vendor2 ]: Yeah, quail.
- Oh, it's quail eggs. Ah, okay.
- How much is one like this?
- [Vendor]: 25 each.
- Huh?
- [Vendor 2]: 25 each.
- 25 each?
- [Vendor 2]: Yeah.
- [Vendor 2]: You're a vlogger?
- I don't know -- yeah, a vlogger.
- [Vendor 2]: Oh, you're a vlogger, huh.
- I just don't know what this is.
[Vendor 2]: You're a vlogger, huh.
But there's no bird inside.
It's not like balut, right?
- [Vendor 2]: Yeah, no, no. There's balut.
- It's not like balut, it's boiled egg.
- You have balut? I don't want.
- [Vendor 2]: Yeah.
Yeah, I'm scared to try -- oh, there's...
- Okay, I don't -- I need an extra hand.
- [Vendor 2]: How many you buy?
One, because I don't know
if I will like it.
- Maybe I don't like it.
- [Vendor 2]: Give it try.
Maybe I don't like it.
Okay, I will try. Okay, so...
20 for you and 25 for the bird man.
[Vendor 2]: Just 45.
The bird man.
What are you advertising?
- Oh, that's your politician.
- [Vendor 2]: That's councilor.
Councilor, ah okay. For election?
- [Vendor 2]: Yeah, election.
- Ah, okay.
25...
- [Vendor 2]: You're a vlogger? Oh.
- Yeah, vlogger from Scotland.
From Scotland.
Okay.
- [Vendor2 ]: What's your country?
- Scotland.
- [Vendor 2]: Huh?
- Scotland.
- [Vendor 2]: It's good. Thank you, sir.
- Okay, that's 25 for you.
- [Vendor 2]: Thank you, sir.
- No problem.
I'm gonna try your eggs, I'm gonna try...
This 20 for you.
- Thank you so much, brother.
- [Vendor]: Thank you.
Okay, it's already melting, guys.
It's very hot here in Manila.
Okay, guys,
the eggs are in my pocket.
It's difficult.
I've only got two hands,
one is always taken by the camera.
This is dripping.
Thank you so much, brother.
Thank you, okay.
So...
Yeah, I actually came out
looking for a late lunch, guys.
I just saw this and...
Well, I just saw it and decided I wanted it.
I love the taste of ube.
Oh my God.
Mmm.
Mmm-mmm-mmm.
Guys, that is sweet and delicious.
This ube, this sweet purple yam,
that you only seem to get
in the Philippines.
It's such a delicious flavour
but you don't see it
in other countries in their desserts,
but you see it everywhere
in the Philippines.
I'm not sure
why it's not popular overseas.
But it's popular with me for sure.
Mmm.
Ah.
And good old 7-Eleven right here.
Hi.
Always useful because
they have bins.
So if you're looking for a bin,
find a 7-Eleven.
And if you're looking for a toilet,
find a McDonald's.
It's kind of universal.
It's kind of universal,
wherever you're travelling,
McDonald's for toilets, 7-Elevens for bins.
That's what they're useful for.
Now, let's give these quail eggs a go.
I thought it was going to be
something weird.
Like they have
something here called balut.
Which is an egg
with a duck embryo inside it.
And people eat that,
as like a snack.
And it looks kind of horrible.
I thought it was going
to be something weird like that.
But I think it is
just the quail eggs that...
maybe you sometimes get
in your salad or something like that,
some boiled quail eggs.
So I think it's just
going to be that but...
I'll crack this open and check it out.
There we go, guys, cracked it open.
My wee egg, my wee quail egg.
And we're on the other side
of this Robinson's Place Mall.
I started from the other side
and walked around.
So, now I know if I come this way again,
I can actually just walk through the mall
rather than the hot sweaty streets.
But when you walk
through the hot sweaty streets,
you find stuff like ube ice cream
and quail eggs.
So that is it, it's just a wee boiled egg.
Mmm.
And it just tastes like a chicken egg
but very much smaller.
And I think the ratio
of yolk to egg white is much greater.
So you're mostly tasting the yolk,
which is delicious.
Yum-yum.
Now, guys,
my original mission.
Which was to find some pancit.
It's these rice noodles
that are very popular with Filipinos.
It's like a cheap delicious wee meal.
Hey, bro, how are you?
Good.
Okay, nice one.
I found one, guys,
on the map, Rita's Pancit.
- [Guy]: Hey.
- So -- hey.
- Let's see.
- [Guy]: I see your vlog.
Oh, okay. Last week, huh?
Okay, nice one.
- [Guy]: In India
- India? Good.
I'm gonna go eat pancit now.
I think down this way.
Yeah.
So, it's Rita's Pancit Malabon.
So, it's a type of pancit called
Pancit Malabon.
So...
Made by a lady called Rita.
Down this way somewhere.
Let's try not to get run over.
Okay, on you go then.
Let's let this traffic past.
Yeah.
I'm blocked in here.
I can't get on the pavement
and I'm blocked in on the road.
Ah, I found it. It's a kind of fancy place.
I was expecting it to be
like a roadside kind of thing.
But established in 1965,
Rita's Pancit Malabon.
So,
let's go in
and order ourselves some pancit.
Hello.
Hi.
How are you?
I come to eat pancit.
Oh, and maybe some snacks as well.
Ube, right?
It looks like some kind of
like ube rice thing.
Ah, this is the menu here.
So...
Filipino Favourites, Pancit Malabon.
These prices look like
they're for like a lot of people.
Oh yeah 5, 8, 12.
I guess I just want the single one.
Oh, you can get Classic and with Sisig.
I want it with Sisig, for sure.
Okay, can I have
Pancit Solo with Sisig, please?
- [Cashier]: 150.
- 150, oh okay.
And maybe I'll take this
for a snack as well.
It's ube, right?
And made from what, rice?
- [Cashier]: Yes.
- Ah, okay. And how much is this one?
- [Cashier]: 120.
- 120, yeah, I'll take this as well.
Ah, they've got prawn crackers here.
And they call them Kropeck.
Which is very similar
to the Indonesian word.
Indonesian word is Krupuk.
Kerupuk.
So, the same thing in different languages
are almost the same,
almost the same word.
Nice.
And this is what I'm getting right here.
If it looks like this,
I'm gonna be happy.
So it's all these noodles,
looks like boiled egg around it
and sisig in the middle.
So, yeah.
Sisig, I've had before and it was tasty.
If it's as good as that
with some noodles,
it's gonna be just what I need
for lunch time.
And while I wait for my pancit sisig,
let's try one of these things.
I don't know what they're called.
These, oh, it's actually sponge.
I thought it was rice or something.
It feels like a very thick sponge cake.
And definitely ube by the colour.
And something probably
maybe sweet cheese or something.
Mmm.
Very sticky. It's not a sponge at all.
I thought it was gonna be
like made from wheat or something like that.
It's very, you can see,
very soft and chewy, spongy.
So it's like tapioca or something,
or it's glutinous rice.
It might be the glutinous rice,
I asked her if it was rice, she said yes.
So that's what it is.
Kind of sticky rice paste,
it's like a paste, a sticky paste,
with the ube flavour.
And I don't know what this is on top.
Let's have a bite of just that.
This stuff.
Yeah, it's cheese.
It's cheese that's on top.
Okay, I'll just have these two.
I'm gonna spoil my appetite
before I get my pancit.
Okay, this is my pancit.
- Okay, thank you so much.
- [Crew]: You're welcome, sir.
Okay, so we've got these yellow noodles.
Looks like it's in like a
kind of thick little soup or something
or some kind of thick gravy.
And then a quarter
of a boiled egg on the side.
And the chopped sisig right there.
I was hoping
they would give me water with it.
A lot of restaurants,
they just give you water
without you asking.
But I didn't order a drink.
Can I get water or...?
Thank you so much, thank you.
Okay, good.
Just in case it's going
to be spicy, guys, I've no idea.
It looks yellow, so...
I don't know, it looks cheesy.
It looks like a noodle version
of macaroni and cheese,
that's what it looks like.
Let's give them a slurp.
Mmm.
Mmm.
It's not cheesy at all, it tastes
a tiny bit spicy and a little bit fishy.
It's got this fishy taste to it.
Mmm.
Maybe they use some fish sauce
or something to make this gravy with.
So I don't know
if that's normal for pancit,
or just because
this is the Pancit Malabon.
It's their variety.
They have a fishy version
of these thick...
I believe they're rice noodles,
thick rice noodles.
This guy's preparing
a huge portion for somebody.
How many people that for?
- Let's see.
- [Crew]: Around 8 to 10.
That's for eight people?
Oh wow. Looks so good.
Okay.
Yeah.
Nice.
It's just the perfect size
for a light lunch,
the solo version here.
Nice.
Now let's grab some of the sisig.
Sisig, it's chopped pork belly,
chicken liver,
I think pork shoulder as well.
All diced up into cubes.
Oh.
Wow.
With like a spice blend
that is incredible.
10 out of 10
flavour hit, the sisig.
Wow.
And it's a spicy sisig, guys.
A spicy, spicy sisig.
So, happy that I got the glass of water.
And for some extra protein,
I still have four quail eggs that
I bought from the guy out on the street.
So, I'm going to crack these open
and put them
in the pancit bowl, right here.
There we go,
I've made my own version.
Quail Egg Pancit Malabon, guys.
Mmm.
Cleared the bowl, guys.
And this is the cook right here?
- [Crew]: Yeah, Rainy Pancho.
- Rainy Pancho.
[Crew]: Yeah.
Mr. Rainy Pancho,
thank you for the delicious
Pancit Malabon.
Yum-yum.
Okay, thank you guys.
Thank you for subscribing as well.
See you, okay.
Nice.
Trying to find myself
a nice refreshing drink now, guys.
And I seen somebody --
oh, I thought this was drinks.
Or maybe it is.
- That's a drink?
- [Vendor]: Yes.
- Gulaman, what is it?
- [Vendor]: Gulaman.
- [Vendor]: It's a gulaman.
- Tea?
It's tea?
- [Vendor]: Gulaman, sir.
- What is gulaman?
- [Vendor 2]: You try now.
- It's juice?
Hang on, I'm going to google it.
I'm going to google it first.
Wait, I'm going to google it.
Gulaman in Filipino cuisine
is a powdered agar or carrageenan
used to make jelly.
- Oh, it's like a jelly. It's jelly?
- [Vendor]: Yeah.
Ah okay, so it's like a jelly.
Okay, like a sweet jelly.
Okay, that sounds good.
One glass, please.
- How much?
- [Vendor 2]: 10 pesos.
10 pesos. Oh, very good, only 18 cents.
That's a good price, 10 pesos.
Okay, yes.
- I'll give you the money first. 10 pesos. - [Vendor 2]:
What is your YouTube channel, sir?
Okay, thank you.
Guys, you know it's cheap
when you can pay for it with one coin.
Wow, gulaman.
[Vendor 2]:
Sir, what is your YouTube channel?
It's nice, it's nice.
My YouTube channel, Dale Philip.
Dale, Dale, like Chip 'n' Dale.
Yeah, Dale like Chip 'n' Dale.
Yeah.
It's very flavoursome.
I can't describe it, guys.
It's very strange.
I can't describe the taste,
it doesn't taste like anything.
It's like...
Hi, how are you?
[Tricycle Driver]: I'm fine.
You're travelling Philippines, huh?
Okay, I'm trying to think
how to describe this taste.
Oh, you're gonna subscribe.
Okay, so for 10 pesos,
I got a drink and a subscriber, guys.
That is a bargain.
Okay.
Let me put this here.
There.
Okay, good.
I was the second Dale
that came up in the Philippines.
I think it was somebody
called Dale Cooper or somebody
came up before me
when I typed in Dale.
Who the heck is he?
Why is he coming up
before yer man on the search?
And yeah, it looks like
they're selling meatballs,
and this siomai and such like right here.
I'm not hungry right now
because I just ate the Pancit Malabon.
Which was lovely.
And this is lovely to wash it down with.
I still don't know
how to describe it though, guys.
That's the thing.
No, you're just gonna have to try it
for yourself to know how it tastes.
There's nothing similar
that I can compare it to.
It's just a unique taste, this.
Oh, everybody enjoying it. Hi.
It's very -- It's nice.
Yeah, two million. Okay, okay.
And plus one, plus one, plus you.
Okay, two million and one.
Okay.
See you, guys,
I'm gonna walk down to Dolomite.
Okay, nice to see you, guys.
Okay, that's good.
10 peso a drink and a new subscriber.
Right, I'm gonna walk down
to this Dolomite beach area.
There were some street vendors
and such like outside.
I'm not gonna go into the actual beach.
I'm not wearing the right footwear.
Guys, if I went on the beach
with these hiking shoes,
I'd be picking the little bits of sand
and stone out for the next couple --
for the rest of the trip basically.
So I'm just gonna take a walk along
the kind of promenade area
that's beside that beach
and maybe see if I can get
maybe another ice cream
or whatever I fancy really.
Hello.
- [Vendor]: Hello, hi.
- Hi.
Look how friendly people
are around here, guys.
Oh, they look good.
- [Vendor 2]: Banana.
- Is it banana? Ah, is it turon? Turon?
Yeah, turon, oh turon.
It's turan. Okay, I had this in --
Oh, that's turon?
[Guy]: Banana, bananacue.
- Oh, this is just banana.
- [Guy 2]: This is turon.
Oh, wow. But this is turon.
Ah, it's like a pastry that's around it, yeah.
So I had this when I was in Kuala Lumpur.
The lady, there was a Filipino mall
in Kuala Lumpur,
and the lady was making turon.
- And it was very tasty.
- [Guy 2]: Very good.
- Ah, okay.
- [Guy 3]: Is that the gulaman drink?
Maybe I will get one.
How much is one turon?
- [Guys]: 20.
- 20 for one.
Oh, it's very good, yeah.
[Guy]: Very good.
35 cents.
- [Vendor 2]: Sir, try our product.
- [Vendor 3]: Try, try.
- Yeah, can I have one turon, please?
- [Vendor 2]: Okay, sir.
- Okay, this is your turon here, yeah?
- [Vendor 2]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Okay.
- [Vendor 3]: Turon.
- [Vendor 4]: Turon, turon.
[Vendor 4]: Turon and banana.
- Still hot or no?
- [Vendor 2]: Yes, sir, still hot.
Still hot? Oh, good.
[Vendor 3]: You like hot, hot, hot?
Plonk myself down here.
They've got one seat,
I don't know if this belongs --
- This is your seat?
- [Vendor 4]: Yeah, yeah.
Okay, I can sit here? Okay, I'll make sure.
Hang on, I'll get you the 20.
- [Vendor 2]: Sir, later. Just eat now.
- Later? Ah, okay.
Well, I already got the money out,
so I might as well give you it now.
- [Vendor 2]: Thank you.
- Okay, thank you.
Oh, oh, ohoho. It's so hot. I was worried.
I was worried
if it was still going to be hot,
because I thought maybe it's lying there,
it's gonna to be cold, but it's burning.
Oh, it's okay, I got it now.
But you just cooked it now?
You just cooked it fresh?
You cooked it fresh, yeah.
Yeah, I think she just cooked this.
It's straight off the...
Where are you cooking?
Oh, you're cooking in here.
Ah, okay.
So she's cooking it in the frying pan.
- [Vendor 2]: Oil, oil, oil.
- In oil, yeah.
Yeah, it's just come out.
- [Guy]: Picture, sir.
- So, okay, let's take a picture.
- [Guy]: Thank you, sir.
- Okay, good, no worries.
Okay, I'm gonna let this
cool down before I try it.
Because it will burn my mouth
if I try it like this.
I'll just sit here and continue
enjoying my gulaman.
Okay, let's try it then.
The lad over there
gave me some tissues to hold it.
Thank you.
So, I'm actually able to hold it,
and pick it up now.
Let's see if I can put it in my mouth.
Mmm.
Oh, wow.
It is crispy, crispy pastry.
I got a bite out of the sweet,
sweet banana,
and it is covered in this sweet,
sweet syrup, right here.
Yeah, it's like caramel,
it's covered in caramel.
So imagine a crispy pastry
covered in caramel
with a sweet cooked banana
in the middle.
Crispy on the outside,
soft on the inside.
[Passerby]: Hi, vlog.
Mmm.
- [Passerby 2]: Hi, sir.
- Good, yeah.
Mmm.
It is so crispy.
Yeah.
There's thick parts of the caramel.
It's like toffee, actually.
It's like eating a toffee apple.
You know the covering
of a toffee apple, the toffee part?
That's what it's like, right there.
So good.
Mmm.
Oh, yeah.
And that's a big portion.
Look at the size of it.
How many bananas in one?
[Vendor 3]: Huh? Three.
- Three bananas in one? Wow.
- [Vendor 3]: Yes. Wow.
So you're eating three bananas,
plus pastry, plus a load of toffee.
It's very sweet and very filling.
[Vendor 3]: Very, very, very delicious.
Mmm.
[Vendor 3]:
Very delicious, very crispy.
Yeah, very sweet.
- [Vendor 2]: Very sweet.
- Yeah.
She's mimicking me.
[Vendor 3]: That is lady is beautiful, very sweet.
- Oh, this lady? She's very beautiful?
- [Vendor 3]: Single.
- And she's very sweet.
Same like the turon.
- [Vendor 3]: Yes, yes, yes, yes.
- Turon is sweet and the lady is sweet.
Yeah.
- Sweet turon and sweet lady, good.
- [Vendor 3]: Yes.
- [Vendor 3]: This is lady, sweet.
- Yes.
- [Vendor 3]: Beautiful.
- Beautiful, just like the turon.
Wow, just people turning up all the time,
just grabbing one and going.
- [Vendor]: Like a turon, crispy.
- Yeah.
I wish Scotland was like that.
We don't have any of these stuff
out in the street where you...
you know, somebody's selling
just like cheap delicious food,
you just grab it and go.
You have some banter with them.
No, everything's just indoors,
processed food, in shops, very boring.
Not like in Manila. This is fun
and this turon is tasty.
[Vendor 3]: The vlogger is handsome.
The vlogger is handsome.
Really? Oh, thank you, so much.
[Vendor 3]: Would you like water, sir?
Water, water?
No, I have gulaman here.
- [Vendor 3]: Ah.
- Yeah.
- [Vendor 3]: Sticky rice?
- I'm full.
- I cannot eat.
- [Vendor 3]: Ah, you cannot eat.
Yeah, I just ate
the Pancit Malabon over there.
Yeah, I ate Pancit Malabon
right before this.
Yeah.
[Vendor 3]: Buy me.
Okay, next time I will take you.
Next time we will go together, okay?
[Vendor 4]: Sir, you take this one.
[Vendor 4]: You take my friend.
Take your friend? Take her where?
[Vendor 3]: No, I'm not single anymore.
- You're not single?
[Vendor 3]: Yes.
The two friends are trying
to give each other to me.
It's so funny.
Okay, that was lovely.
Thank you so much, ladies.
I'll see you next time.
I'm walking around.
I will see you. Bye bye.
- [Vendors]: Thank you, sir. Bye.
- See you. Okay.
That was nice, wasn't it?
A sweet treat,
banter,
and yeah, you just feel good
after those kind of interactions.
Much better than going
into some restaurant in the mall,
in Robinson's Mall,
ordering your food, eating it and going.
You know.
To be honest, sometimes you feel
like that, you know.
Sometimes you feel like
you just want some peace,
you just want to sit down,
have no interaction with people,
eat your food and go.
And that's fine, but sometimes,
you're feeling sociable, aren't you?
And you want that kind of...
you want that kind of...
Oh, it's okay.
Got a trike there.
I haven't been in one of them yet.
They look...
They look pretty dangerous.
But yeah, sometimes you,
I don't know, guys.
If you're just feeling like you need
a bit of social interaction,
just come and walk along the streets,
order food, talk to people,
and it's all good.
Guys, okay, it's so hot.
I like to be,
when I'm walking in the city
on the side of the road,
that is in the shade.
Ah, good old 7-Eleven
providing
the rubbish bins.
Okay, I'm going to head down
this way towards the beach.
Got the local lads
playing basketball here.
If this was Scotland,
they'd all be
playing five-a-side football.
But it's Manila, Philippines,
so they're playing basketball.
Hey!
Yes!
Good.
They play rough, man, they play rough.
There's a lot of contact
in the Filipino version of basketball.
Ah, here it is, the Dolomite Beach.
It's actually right beside
the American Embassy,
so I wasn't able to film
down there at all.
So this guy,
he tried to take a selfie with me,
and the guards
at the American Embassy were like,
"Turn that off."
- They told you off, right?
- [Guy]: Yeah, yeah.
So take it here.
- [Guy]: Okay, yeah.
- Yeah, okay.
- [Guy]: Thank you, buh-bye.
- Okay, no worries. Okay, see you.
- [Guy]: Thank you.
- Okay.
Oh, there's coconut water right there.
Okay.
There's coconut water.
Hey, what's up?
Oh, that's cool.
Oh, it's a playing card.
Ah okay, magic trick.
- [Magician]: Magic tricks.
- Ah okay, very good.
[Magician]: Come closer, sir.
I will show you.
[Magician]: So put in here,
automatically, float the coins.
How does that work? Hmm, I don't know.
[Magician]: There's a second gadget here.
- Ah, something here?
- [Magician]: Here.
Really?
Where? Nothing, there's nothing.
- It's just a bit of...
- [Magician]: Magic wax.
Yeah, it's a bit of blue tack
or something.
- [Magician]: Tansan. (Bottle cap.)
- Yeah.
[Magician]: Put it here inside,
automatically, float the tansan (bottle cap.).
- Ah, how does that work?
- [Magician]: See that?
- I don't know, I can't figure it out.
- [Magician]: Cigarette.
[Magician]: So put in here inside.
Is it on your hat?
- [Magician]: Oh, oh.
- Oh wait, I feel something.
I felt something, I felt something,
I felt something, yeah.
[Magician]: Open your hand.
Open your hand, sir.
- Yeah?
- [Magician]: Like this.
- [Magician]: It's empty.
- Okay.
Oh.
Ooh.
There's some
invisible string or something.
Oh yeah, you got like a --
oh this, yeah, sticky stuff.
- [Magician]: This one is the gadget here.
- Ah.
What is it?
[Magician]: This is a gadget, magic wax.
Ah, it's got the wax.

Okay, he got me with that one.
He got me with that one,

So the instructions come

- Touch it? Oh, I see the string. It's very small.
- [Magician]: Sorry, he died.
I can see the string now.
It's very, very thin though.
[Magician]: This one is the gadget here.
Ah, okay, the Twisty Worm.
Okay, I'm gonna take the scarf,
and then I'm gonna go and learn
how to do it.
Okay, I'll give you 200 bro, no worries.
[Magician]: The card, sir.
The card is nice, sir.

[Magician]: And then the back, same.

[Magician]: If you buy the card, sir,

Only 500, uh?

- Yeah?
- [Magician]: You hold the card.
- Let me see.
- [Magician]: The card is face up.

[Magician]: And then the back,
automatically same.
- [Magician]: Oh. See?
- Whoa.
- [Magician]: This is a magic card, sir.
- Ah, I see.
When you flick it from the back,
you see the nines.
- But if you look at it...
- [Magician]: It's a...
Ah, I don't get it. I still don't get it.
[Magician]: This one has different item,
many nine of clubs.
Yeah?
And then how to work same,
and then how to work, ordinary.
[Magician]: It's a different sizes.
Okay, I'll go back to my room
and figure it out.
That's 500. I'll take this and this.
Okay.
[Magician]: Don't shuffle, sir,
This alternate arrange.
- [Magician]: Ordinary. Ordinary.
- Okay.
That's ordinary and that,
and there's a way to flick it
so that only the nine show.
- [Magician]: Okay.
- Okay.
- [Magician]: Face up, ordinary.
- Yeah.
[Magician]: And then tap the cards, same.
- Okay.
- [Magician]: This a double card.
Okay, it's double,
they're double cards, basically.
Okay, I'm gonna go back
to my hotel room and figure it out.
And then play the same tricks
on other people
once I learn.
Okay.
- [Magician]: This one, sir, you like?
- No, no.
You're trying to upsell me.
Always trying to upsell me.
- It was 200, 500, 1000, 2000... 1 million.
- [Magician]: 1 million.
- [Magician]: Then I give you free.
- Okay.
- Okay.
- [Magician]: Hold the magic ball.
[Magician]: The invisible ball.
Oh, you give me
an invisible ball for free? Okay.
[Magician]: Small ball. Okay.
He's giving me an invisible ball for free.
Fantastic.
- [Magician]: It's empty plastic.
- Oh wait, I will put it here.
[Magician]: Then count to one to three,
throw it inside.
- [Magician]: Wait, wait.
- Okay.
[Magician]:
One, two, three, throw it inside.
Oh okay, there we go,
I got my invisible ball.
Okay, that's good.
- [Magician]: You know the snap, sir, like this.
- Yeah, you flick it, yeah.
I learned that when I was a kid.
Yeah, I did that when I was a kid.
- [Magician]: Oh. Snappy.
- I learned that one.
- [Magician]: It's only 1,000.
- Ah okay, yeah, okay.
[Magician]: Free, and then this one.
- [Magician]: Thank you, my friend.
Okay, thank you so much.
Thank you for the magic.
It was magic.
Okay.
- [Magician]: Sir.
-That's magic.
- [Girl]: Dale?
- D-A-L-E.
Okay, good.
I got some subscribers as well.
Okay.
- [Girl]: Can I take photo, sir?
- Oh okay, sure.
- [Girl]: Thank you.
- Okay, nice, no problem.
Okay. Hi, yes, I'm Dale. How are you?
- [Guy]: Are you Dale Philip?
[Guy]: You're my -- I'm your greatest fan.
You're my biggest fan, really? Oh, okay.
- [Guy]: I follow you.
- Oh, wow.
He showed me the Facebook,
he's watched all the videos.
Okay.
Ah, okay, sure.
- [Girl]: Thank you.

[Guy 2]: One, two, three.
Okay, no worries. Okay.
- [Guy]: Thank you, thank you.
- Nice to see you, thank you.
Okay.
Oh, okay.
- [Guy 3]: Thank you, Dale.
- Okay, it's good.
Some nice photos we've taken, right here.
A bunch of new subscribers as well,
that's good.
It makes me feel better
when I overpay for something.
When I overpay for something like a...
I don't know if that's overpaying or not.
It's like...
Hi.
It's like $9 or something like that
for a wee magic trick.
Yeah, but the performance was worth it.
That's the thing, the performance.
It was definitely worth it,
wasn't it, guys?
Okay...
- [Cyclist]: Can I take a picture?
- Okay, sure.
- Oh, you're going cycling?
- [Cyclist]: Yeah.
You can cycle all the way down here,
there's like a flat pavement?
- [Cyclist]: Yeah.
- Yeah, okay, that's good.
All along the Dolomite.
- [Cyclist]: Thank you.
I'm a huge follower.
- Okay, enjoy your bicycle ride.
- [Cyclist]: Thank you.
That's cool.
I didn't realise that.
There's a whole like a bicycle track
down here on this flat, nice...
yeah, this flat nice pavement
alongside the Dolomite Beach.
- [Girl]: Why nobody here inside?
- It's closed.
[Girl]: It's closed.
Oh, closed every Thursday for maintenance.
Oh, luckily, I came before
when it was open.
- So...
- [Girl]: Oh, okay.
Yeah, luckily I didn't plan
to come to the beach today
- because it's closed.
- [Girl]: Hello.
- Hello, how are you?
- [Girl]: I'm good.
- You're from Manila?
- [Girl]: Welcome to Philippines.
[Girl]: No, from Maguindanao, Cotabato.
- Oh, you're here to work or study?
- [Girl]: I'm now applying for a job.
Oh, you're applying for a job here.
Ah okay, well, good luck.
- Good luck.
- [Girl]: Thank you, sir.
- Okay, nice to see you. Bye-bye.
- Nice to see you, too.
Okay, guys, I'm going back
into my hotel right here,
to soak up some AC for half an hour.
Hey, bro, how are you?
Okay, good.
I'm going to soak up some AC
for half an hour,
and then I'll be back out
onto the streets.
Okay, guys.
Yer man is back
in his nice air-conditioned suite,
soaking up all the AC, feeling refreshed,
and I can now have a chance
to figure out these magic tricks
that I couldn't figure out
when I was down at the beach.
The guy was so fast, you know.
Typical magician,
just everything's really
done quickly to distract you,
because that's the main thing,
they're trying to fool you, aren't they?
So I've had a play around with these cards
and with the silk trick right here
that actually comes with instructions.
This doesn't come with instructions
but it's easy to figure this out.
I figured that out easily enough.
This...
Reading the instructions,
what you're supposed to do
is, you've got this plastic thumb here,
which is going to convince nobody on me,
it's a different colour to me,
maybe it was the same colour
as that guy's hand
and that's why I couldn't really
see him using it but
for me, it's a different colour
and it's much thicker as well.
My thumb is a lot thinner than this
big thick old thumb.
But how you're supposed to do it is,
you kind of like hold this
in the palm of your hand like that.
So you make it look
like you're feeding the scarf
into the thumb like that.
"Oh, it's in the palm of my hand,
it's in the palm of my hand."
But is it? Is it?
No, it's not.
Where is it? Where is it?
Oh, I don't know.
So, I guess because this --
oh, it's upside down.
That's definitely not going
to convince anybody,
it's bloody upside down.
Yeah, I think to try
and not like let them see the false thumb.
You kind of keep it like here.
You know, "Where is it? Where is it?"
But for me,
it's just such a different colour.
That it's going to convince nobody,
nobody's gonna be fooled by that.
But that's how you do it, it's like that.
And then there'll be more
slight of hand to like get it back out,
which would take a lot of practice.
I'm sure that guy's been doing
those tricks for years.
So, good on him.
That's why I overpaid, you know.
Like a trick like that would be
like 10 cents off of AliExpress.
This synthetic, it's not silk for sure,
synthetic piece of cloth,
and like a plastic thumb.
You could probably buy like,
for what I paid,
you could probably get
like a pack of a hundred of these tricks
off AliExpress.
But yeah, that's a good business idea
by the guy down there,
because yeah, basically,
what you're paying for
is the show and stuff.
So, that's a good way to do it.
He does magic shows,
and then instead of like
asking for tips or whatever,
he just sells the tricks
with the instructions.
It's... that's a good hustle,
it's a good hustle by the guy.
And this, if you didn't figure it out,
the guy said they were two-sided cards.
Well they're definitely
not two-sided, look.
They're one-sided
and each card
only has like one thing on it.
They're not --
there's no tricks to the cards at all.
What the trick is,
is the way that the pack is...
well the way that the cards are cut.
So every -- let me see.
If I just...
If I flick through like that,
you'll see there's a lot --
every other card's
kind of different, right?
But...
If I flick through this way...
they're all nine of clubs, right?
So how does that work?
Well, how it works is,
the nines and the jacks
are different lengths.
The nines are just like
if you place them like this,
the nines are just
a little bit lower down.
So when you're flicking through,
when you're flicking through this pack,
your fingers only ever touching the top,
the top part there,
so you're never touching the nines,
the nine of clubs, or the nine of flower,
as he called it, the nine of clubs.
Like that.
But when you do the opposite way,
then you're exposing the nine.
So that's how it works, guys,
that's how it works.
So figured it out.
I think this trick
is the one I'm probably
going to have the most success with
if I practice.
If I practice with this,
I might have the most success
tricking people.
This is tricking nobody for sure.
Anyway, you might be wondering,
"Why, Dale, are you dressed like Hugh?"
"Big Hugh Heffner right now?"
Well, why do you think?
If you've watched my previous vlogs,
you know why I'm dressed
like Hugh Heffner, don't you?
You know what I'm about to do.
Big Hugh is about to go
for that wee swim, isn't he?
And guys, I don't know if I have
any Hughs following my channel.
But if you are called Hugh
and you come to Scotland,
your name will be Shug.
That's an interesting fact for you.
Yes, in Scotland,
we call people called Hugh, Shug.
So he wouldn't be
Hugh Heffner in Scotland,
he'd be Shug Heffner.
Old Shuggy Heffner.
Old Shuggy Heffner,
oh, he's always got his dressing gown on,
always with his bunnies.
Well, I've got the dressing gown on,
ain't got no bunnies.
I do have a
can of Vanilla Coke Zero so that's nice.
And yeah,
let's make our way to the pool
with the vanilla Coke Z.
Unfortunately,
not an ice cream.
If
I was back in Scotland and I was a kid,
I would have went
to see a man called Shug.
A man called Hugh
who had an ice cream van.
So he was called Shug,
and his ice cream van
was called Shuggy's Buggy.
That used to stop by my house,
you'd hear the music.
♪ Do do do do do ♪
And everybody "Oh, Shuggy's Buggy,"
everybody runs.
Everybody runs
and gets a vanilla ice cream cone.
Like your man just with a vanilla.
Oh, look at that, you can see how humid,
even like almost 6 PM, almost sunset,
you can see just like how humid
this country is, the city is.
As soon as I step out
my air condition room,
this is like my...
my can is sweating, never mind me.
But...
Oh yeah, it looks like
I'm getting the pool to myself.
We've got one lad in the jacuzzi.
But
the swimming pool is all for yer man.
Fantastic.
- [Hotel Staff]: Hi, sir.
- Hi, how are you?
- [Hotel Staff]: Good afternoon.
- Okay, thank you so much.
- [Hotel Staff]: Enjoy your swim.
- Okay, thanks.
Okay, lovely.
Ah.
Oh, I almost had it to myself,
somebody actually took the...
somebody actually jumped in.
I'm too busy relaxing
enjoying my Vanilla Coke Zero, guys.
But... yeah.
She doesn't look like much of a swimmer,
I don't think she's going to be
in there for long.
Oh, and I can see.
I didn't see this
the last time I was at the pool
because it was so dark.
But that's the last place I stayed in
at this area.
About 2016,
I had a condo there from Airbnb.
The Birch Tower right there.
That's cool.
Aah.
That's good.
That's refreshing, guys,
that's what you need.
That's what you need
when you've been out in the streets,
the hot sweaty streets of Manila, up here.
Eight stories high.
Getting the cool breeze.
The nice refreshing water.
Lovely, guys, lovely.
- [Hotel Staff]: Hi, sir.
- Hi, how are you?
- [Hotel Staff]: Good.
- Good.
- [Hotel Staff]: I see your vlogs.
- Okay, nice one.
Okay, guys, I'm back out onto the streets.
It's actually the next day.
After I had my wee swim last night,
yesterday evening,
I decided to come out here
and I went and got myself a haircut.
I got my hair tidied up.
I was over at Denny's over there.
Enjoying an all-day breakfast.
That was nice.
And then I finished off
the evening with a massage.
All in this area right here.
In fact, that is where I got
my haircut yesterday in there.
Oh, it's a different...
It's a different dude,
it's a different dude today.
But...
Yeah, when I went for my haircut,
one of the guys working there
recognised me,
and he said,
"Why are you not vlogging?"
He says, "Why are you not vlogging?"
As if it's unusual for a travel vlogger
to get a haircut and not vlog it.
Because yeah, these days,
every travel vlogger vlogs their haircuts.
For some reason.
I think Harald Baldr
kicked off the trend like five years ago.
And now everybody does it.
Okay, I'm gonna go down
one of the side streets,
this is too noisy.
Now, everybody does it, everybody...
Everybody vlogs their haircuts.
But I don't.
I've never vlogged a haircut.
But...
Yeah, that was good.
Good wee evening.
This area is just so good for tourists,
there's just so much
bars, restaurants, massage, salons.
Like come here, feed yourself,
get pampered, enjoy all the local treats.
Look at that. Loads of little...
Food vendors all over the place.
I like it, guys, I like this area.
Now, my mission for this afternoon
is to find myself some Tapsilog.
Tapsilog, another famous Filipino dish
that I have not tried yet.
So that's what I'm on the hunt for.
Ah.
This one here says Tapsilogan.
I guess that's Tapsilog.
It looks like a bar
or a little shop to me.
Let's see.
[Tapsilogan Crew]: Yes, sir.
Hi, you have Tapsilog?
- [Tapsilogan Crew]: Tapsilog.
- Okay, you have menu?
[Tapsilogan Crew]: Menu.
Menu here, okay.
- [Tapsilogan Crew]: Yes, sir.
- Tapsilog.
Oh, there's many choices:
Tapsilog, Porksilog, Bangsilog,
Cornsilog, Hotsilog, Spamsilog.
[Tapsilogan Crew]: Yes, sir.
Oh, I think I want the Tapsilog.
[Tapsilogan Crew]:
Tapsilog. One Tapsilog.
- Yeah.
- [Tapsilogan Crew]: One order?
Yeah, one order.
One portion of Tapsilog, please.
So it's the beef and rice together, yes?
- [Tapsilogan Crew]: Yeah, with egg.
- Ah, okay.
Yeah, and maybe a drink as well.
Oh yeah, I like this one,
the pineapple juice.
My tapsilog is here.
And when the chef delivered it,
he says it's the best tapsilog
in Malate, right?
- The best one? Okay
- [Tapsilogan Crew]: Yes, sir.
So what is Tapsilog?
Well, Silog is...
There's many things
on the menu called Silog, right?
Hello.
There's many things
on the menu called Silog.
And Silog is the rice and egg.
So it's like a breakfast food
for Filipinos.
It's something Silog.
So the menu,
it had like Porksilog, Spamsilog, etc.
But the famous one is a Tapsilog,
which comes with tapa,
which is this, this is tapa.
And tapa is like a beef jerky.
So it's kind of preserved
cured slices of beef.
They're like cured with salt or whatever.
And then I think it's heated up.
Oh, it's hot, yeah.
Ooh.
Oh, it tastes like bacon.
Mmm.
That was a really fatty bit there, yeah.
That's lovely
It's like...
Not as preserved
and not as hard as beef jerky,
it's like nice and soft.
Basically, to me,
that taste is with the same texture
and taste as bacon.
It's lovely.
And this should be a breakfast food
but I'm having it for lunch.
Yum-yum.
[Guy]: Yummy.
Yeah, it is yummy.
It is good.
The tapa is really...
the tapa is delicious.
And this tapa,
it's just seasoned with salt and pepper,
so you're just getting the beefy taste,
which is nice.
It's not one of these dishes
that are just covered in a lot of sauce,
or a lot of spices, or whatever,
you're actually tasting the beef,
which is tasty.
And yeah, I'm the only one here, guys.
I'm the only one here that's eating
because this breakfast food, right?
[Tapsilogan Crew]: Yes, sir.
Yeah, so it's either breakfast food
or they will eat it for like hangover.
So, you know,
like if we're at a night club in the UK,
maybe afterwards we go for a kebab,
maybe they go for tapsilog.
And this street,
it's all bars and stuff, this street,
it's like a nightlife street,
so maybe that's it,
maybe people are here
in the morning for breakfast,
they're here late at night
while they're, you know, drinking.
But right now, it's quiet.
It's just me, I'm the only one
who comes here at lunch time.
This guy just
chasing the cat out of the restaurant.
-  120.
- 120, yeah.
[Tapsilogan Crew]: You should try our Sisig next.
- [Tapsilogan Crew]: When you come back.
- Try this next? What is this?
[Tapsilogan Crew]: Sisig.
Oh, this is Sisig?
Yeah, I've tried before and I like it.
Yeah, it's good. Sisig is good.
Yeah, I like Sisig.
[Tapsilogan Crew]:
I've watched you somewhere in Facebook.
You watched me on facebook?
Oh, okay good.
- [Tapsilogan Crew]: I remember you.
- Follow and thumbs up, please, thank you.
Good.
Okay, so 120 total.
So it's 75 for the Tapsilog
and 45 for the pineapple juice.
120, okay, thank you so much.
See you next time, brother,
enjoy your Sisig.
Okay.
[Tapsilogan Crew]: Thank you, sir.
Thank you, sir. Come again.
Guys, 75 pesos for the Tapsilog.
That is like $1.40 or so.
A bargain.
A bargain for a nice wee meal.
And it was a wee meal.
Still got my appetite guys.
So we can do further exploring.
Can't we?
Oh yeah, that's where I've eaten before,
as well, Best Friends,
I had the Pork Adobo in there.
That was delicious.
But now, guys...
ah, I don't see any street vendors.
I'm just gonna wander around
until I find somebody
selling some liquid refreshment.
That was very salty.
Very, very salty,
I could do with some kind of...
some kind of...
fresh juice or whatever.
The thing is, here,
I see a lot of like juice vendor
selling kind of like...
sugary drinks or whatever.
I don't see
like the fresh fresh fruit juice
vendors that I would see
in India and Pakistan.
You would find them everywhere in India.
You would just go down --
like if I was in India right now,
I would just go down
some random street like this,
and there'd be a guy with a cart
with like stacked with pomegranates.
Hello.
He have like a cart
and it would be stacked with pomegranates,
and you could just go,
pomegranate juice,
he'll grind it up fresh, fresh, fresh,
and cheap,
or oranges or whatever.
You know.
But I don't see that in Manila at all,
I don't know why.
Sometimes you'll just see
somebody selling like pre-made,
like sugary drinks or whatever.
But yeah, I'm gonna wander around
and see what I can find, guys.
Ah, it looks like she has some juice.
This gulaman?
- [Vendor]: Yes.
- Oh, okay. I'll have one glass please.
How much is one glass?
- [Vendor]: 10 pesos.
- 10 pesos, good.
No, no, no, no,
I'll get you some juice if you want.
You want juice?
You want gulaman?
Gulaman?
Gulaman?
Ask him if he wants...
No?
You want gulaman?
- He wants or no?
- [Vendor]: He wants food.
He wants food?
What is this?
- [Vendor]: It's togue.
- Togue.
- It's meat or...
- [Vendor]: It's vegetables.
- Vegetables. How much is one?
- [Vendor]: 10 pesos.
Okay, I'll buy him one of them
and I will buy myself the juice.
Oh, got a hole in that one.
Yeah.
Oh, you're doing your homework?
Good.
Okay, thank you.
[Vendor]: Gulaman.
Gulaman, good.
It's a nice taste, the gulaman.
Okay, give to the kid.
Ask him if he wants one of these.
You want or no? Okay, he wants.
One of them for him.
And one for me as well, I will try.
One for him and one for me.
[Vendor]: Okay.
I don't know what it is.
What did you say this was again?
[Vendor]: It's Lumpiang Togue.
- Lumpiang... Togue.
- [Vendor]: Togue.
- What is Togue?
- Spring onions.
Spring onions, ah okay.
Enjoy, enjoy. Okay?
- I will try it as well.
- [Boy]: Thank you po.
Oh, he said "Thank you po."
Very nice, very respectful.
Okay, I'll try this spring roll.
Thank you so much.
Okay.
I'm gonna...
I'm gonna stand here
because I don't have enough hands.
- [Vendor]: Vinegar.
- What is this, some vinegar?
[Vendor]: Yes.
Really?
You think it's better with vinegar?
- [Vendor]: Yes.
- Okay.
Oh, it's got chilies
and, it's going to be spicy, right?
[Vendor]: A little bit.
A little bit?
Okay, I'll just put a little bit of this,
oh, vinegar on it.
And give this a go.
- It's a...
- [Lady]: Hello.
Spring roll with -- hi, how are you?
- [Lady]: I'm fine. I'm good.
- Say hello to everyone in Scotland.
[Lady]: Everyone, hi, hello, everyone.
- Hi, hello, Scotland.
- [Lady]: Hello, Scotland.
Hello, Scotland, from the Philippines.
Okay, I'm gonna put this down here,
and try this spring roll
with spring onions.
Mmm.
- [Lady]: It's tasty, right?
- Oh. yeah. It's vegetables, yeah?
There's carrots, and bean sprouts, and...
- Looks like...
- [Vendor]: Pumpkin.
Carrot -- oh, pumpkin?
Oh yeah, pumpkin is in there as well.
Pumpkin, carrot, and bean sprouts, right?
Mmm.
[Lady]: We see you in YouTube.
- Really?
- Yeah.
- Are you subscribed or not subscribed?
- [Lady]: I'm subscriber.
You subscribe? Really? Good.
Good.
Thank you, so much.
Mmm.
- The lady's helping -- bye-bye, see you.
- [Lady]: Buh-bye.
And the lady's helping
the little kid do his homework.
In English or in Tagalog?
[Vendor]: I'm just teaching him
how to write his name.
Oh, his name. Ah okay, good.
Good?
Enjoy?
Okay, good. I'm enjoying it as well.
Fairly healthy as well.
Stuffed with, it's like boiled pumpkin.
Mmm.
Mmm.
Let's wash it down with the gulaman.
So I've had this before
and I couldn't describe the taste.
Mmm.
It's just a sweet...
It's a sweet juice
but I can't describe the taste.
How would you describe the gulaman taste?
How can you describe it?
It's unique.
I think it's unique.
Yeah, it's unique, that's right.
There's nothing I can --
Usually, if I can't describe
the taste of food,
I would compare it to something
that's like a little bit similar,
but I can't describe,
I can't think of anything similar
to the gulaman.
I think she's got something else,
I might as well --
I've tried two of the three
things she's selling,
I might as well try this as well.
The jelly milk.
What is the jelly milk?
[Vendor]:
It's jelly with the condensed milk.
It's a drink or it's a food?
It's a jelly -- oh, it's a jelly.
Oh, it's like a jelly.
And you put condensed milk on top?
[Vendor]: Yes.
Okay, I'll have one of them
as well please.
Yeah, good.
Then I've tried everything.
I've tried all your things.
Mmm.
Oh, there's somebody saying hello.
Hello, how are you, bro?
Good.
Okay.
This your house?
This your business, your shop?
[Vendor]: It's my cousin.
Cousin.
Oh, so like everyone is like family?
- [Vendor]: Yes. It's a clan.
- Oh, good.
Okay, let's try the jelly, milk jelly.
It's just jelly and condensed milk.
Oh.
Oh, it's so sweet.
Oh, it's so sweet.
Yeah, that's a lot of condensed milk.
Yeah, it's so sweet.
Mmm.
I'm mashing this up, guys.
I'm turning it into a drink.
Mash, mash, mash.
Mmm.
Mmm.
He's impressed at how fast I ate that.
He was smiling.
Good?
Oh okay, I need to pay for the jelly milk,
I didn't pay for the jelly milk.
Okay, this for the jelly milk,
I didn't pay you yet.
Okay, for the jelly milk.
Okay, thank you, see you.
Have a nice day.
Okay, guys.
- [Guy]: Hey, brother.
- Hey, brother. How are you?
- [Guy]: I'm fine.
- Good.
That was lovely, guys, that was lovely.
A nice sweet treat
after that salty Tapsilog.
And now that the belly is feeling good,
I'm actually on a hunt
for a baseball cap.
Guys, every time I used to do
a vlog in the beginning,
every time it was a new trip,
I would buy myself a baseball cap.
And then for some reason,
I got out of that habit.
Well, I guess I got a collection
of like half a dozen baseball caps,
and I didn't need any more.
But this trip, I don't think
I brought a baseball cap with me.
And I will be going down south
to the islands soon,
I'll be in the sun a lot,
so I could probably do it
with a baseball cap.
So I need to see if I can find
like a kind of market area
or something like that around here.
Hopefully, I can, because
my plan B...
Oh, there are like little stalls
and stuff here.
Oh, he does have some baseball caps
but I was hoping for a better selection.
My plan B if I can't find
a baseball cap or a market
for a baseball cap here,
is to go to Divisoria.
Which I can't really be bothered doing.
It's that huge, huge market area.
It's so busy.
It's exhausting.
But,
yeah, that's where I'm gonna have to go
if I don't find one here
in this Malate area.
I'm gonna have a wee
wander around though, guys.
Baseball cap?
- Like this, I wanna buy.
- [Boy]: There's Robinson's.
Robinson's, ah, I want to find
like an outdoor market.
How are you?
[Man]: Fine. I see you at the hotel, huh?
- Hotel?
- [Man]: You stay in hotel?
- Yeah, I stay in hotel, yeah.
- [Man]: Because I work there.
You work there? Okay, good. Nice one.
Okay, I'm trying to --
yeah, Robinson's,
I want to find like a street market,
street market like...
[Boys]: Street market?
[Man]: If you want to go
to the street market.
- What?
- [Man]: You go to the local market.
Local market, yeah,
that's what I'm trying find,
San Andres Market.
- [Man]: Over there.
- [Boy]: San Andres Market.
- Oh, there and there, San Andres Market.
- [Man]: Let's go, I'll go with you.
Oh, no, it's okay.
I'll go alone, bro, it's okay. Thank you.
Thank you for the advice.
I;ll go to San Andres Market, right?
[Man]: Come on, I show you.
Okay. No, it's okay, it's okay.
You don't need to show me, it's okay.
See you. See you, guys.
- [Man]: I go with you.
- No don't go. Don't come with me.
How are you, bro?
- Good?
- [Guy]: I'm fine.
- Okay, good.
- [Guy]: Where are you going?
I'm go to San Andres.
Yeah. This way, and there.
Okay, thank you.
So, guys, if some random person
comes up to you in Asia,
and says that they work in your hotel,
and it's out on the street,
usually, like 99% of times,
it's a scam.
So...
Yeah, that happened a lot in Colombo
when I was walking around.
They would see me coming out my hotel,
and be like,
"Oh you're staying in the Steuart Hotel,"
Oh, man.
- [Guys]: My friend.
- Hi, hi. Okay.
- [Guy]: My friend.
- Hi.
- What's that?
- [Guy]: Walking around.
Okay. It's okay.
Nah, it's okay, it's okay.
Yeah, they would say,
"Oh, I know you're staying
in this Steuart Hotel,"
"Oh, I'm the cleaner there" or...
"I'm the janitor there",
"I'm the engineer there",
and then they'd offer you to...
say "Let's go. Let's go to bar together",
or something like that.
It would happen so often.
So...
Yeah.
Maybe now and again
that situation happens,
and it's true the guy really
does work at your hotel
and just wants to like be nice
and show you around and stuff,
but that's like a 1 in 100 chance.
So better to err
on the side of caution, guys, and
just ignore people
when that situation occurs.
So, I'm trying to find
the San Andres Market.
It was on the Google Maps
when i typed in market.
It was the only thing that looks like
I might be able to get a baseball cap from.
Hang on.
I gotta take care of this.
[Guy]: Ride. Ride or walking around
in the Malate.
What's that?
Ah, no, it's okay, I don't need. Okay.
- [Guy]: You wanna?
No, it's okay.
So this guy's offering
to give me a tour of Malate.
I've pretty much had a tour of Malate by now.
I've pretty much walked
through all the streets.
Uhm...
I forgot what I was saying.
Oh yeah, I typed in market on Google Maps,
and all these like actual supermarkets
and everything turned up.
But there's this one
called San Andres Market,
which is I think the
area that I'm in is San Andres.
It came up,
which I think might be a place
where they're actually selling.
Hi.
Where they're actually selling goods.
So let's go for it.
Okay, so this is it on... Google Maps.
This is the San Andres Market,
I think it's like an indoor thing.
I see this big yellow building
with maybe some outdoor bits.
And I am seeing a lot
of like phone cases and such like.
Okay, I'm positive.
I'm positive I can get a baseball cap
in here, guys, somewhere.
One stall at least is going to be
selling baseball caps here.
Oh, so this is all like
phone repair shops,
and such like.
There's a wet market area down here.
This area absolutely stinks.
I don't want to be wandering around here.
- [Guy]: Yes, sir?
- Hi, po. How are you?
I'm looking for a cap, baseball cap.
- [Guy]: Baseball cap.
- Yeah. Any shop selling here?
Baseball cap in San Andres Market, no?
Ah, okay. I thought I would get one here.
They're selling everything
but no baseball caps, okay.
Pointing.
- [Lady]: Outside.
- Outside? Okay.
No.
I don't see
any shop selling what I want.
You would think with all this stuff,
there would be one
that sells baseball caps.
They're selling bags, t-shirts, such like.
You know.
Nobody selling baseball cap?
Cap.
This way?
Okay.
Oh, you have some caps here, hidden away.
Ah, I see.
There's a Nike one there.
New York Yankees.
Okay, thank you.
Okay.
She had about 10 different caps.
I didn't like any of them so...
The hunt continues, guys.
The hunt continues.
Is this more stalls down here?
I think it's fruit.
Unfortunately,
I think I'm gonna have to head to
Divisoria, the big, big market.
To get a big, big selection
and find one that I actually want.
Aah.
Yeah, should I take
one of these like trikes?
We're not that far away,
I could probably take one of them there.
I think it might only be like a
15-minute ride or something.
There's a bunch of trikes here,
but I think they're waiting
for this school to finish.
I think these are here to pick up kids
from school and take them home.
These trikes.
Do you have a passenger or no?
You can take me or no?
No, you're waiting
for the school, right? Yeah.
So I'm probably not going to have any luck
picking one up from here.
Oh, these ones are actually pedaled.
No, it's okay.
His trike says "Forever" on it.
It would take forever
to get to Divisoria with a bicycle one.
You need one like this, like a motor bike.
Motor bike trike.
You have a passenger? You can take me?
[Trike Driver]:
I for the student.
Oh, you're waiting for the student?
Yeah, everyone here
is waiting for the students.
Yeah.
I'm gonna have to go on another street.
Thank you, bro, thank you.
I'm gonna have to go onto another street
if I want to pick one of these up.
Hello, guys. You have passenger?
- [Trike Driver]: Yeah?
- You can take me?
Divisoria, Divisoria.
- [Trike Drivers]: Divisoria?
- Yeah.
[Trike Driver]: Divisoria Court?
Divisoria Market, market.
- [Vendor]: Divisoria.
- Yeah, Divisoria.
- [Trike Driver]: How much you pay?
- 100 pesos.
Okay?
- Come.
- [Trike Driver]: No, no, no. 500.
500? No way.
I can take Grab for 200.
[Trike Driver]: It's very, so far.
- Too far, really?
- [Trike Driver]: Too far, yeah, yeah.
It's okay, I will take the Grab,
I will take the Grab.
- [Guy]: 500?
- 500, no.
To Divisoria, he's asking 500.
I'll take a Grab for 200.
Take a Grab.
What? How much?
- [Trike Drivers]: 200.
- How much?
- [Trike Driver]: Last price 200.
- Last price is 200?
- [Trike Driver]: Two persons.
- Oh, two persons?
- [Trike Driver]: 100 each.
- 100 each?
- [Trike Driver]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Me and who else?
- [Trike Driver]: The other person.
- No, he's not going, he's not going.
He's not going.
Okay, you'll take me for 200,
Divisoria Market?
- [Trike Driver 2]: Divisoria Market?
- Yes, Divisoria Market. Okay.
- [Trike Driver]: Go, go.
- Okay, let's go, let's go, 200. Okay.
So I looked up the price on Grab
to take a car, it was 285, so.
- [Trike Driver 2]: One shot. Okay.
- Okay, what's up?
- Beautiful, beautiful. Okay.
- [Trike Driver 2]: Okay, okay.
He gave us a good smile.
Okay, let's get in this trike.
So it is like a motorbike.
It's a motorbike,
and this is like attached here
and here to the side cart, so.
[Trike Driver 2]:
This is our motorcycle in the Philippines.
- Motorcycle in the Philippines.
- [Trike Driver 2]: Yes.
What do you call this,
you call this trike?
[Trike Driver 2]: Tricycle, tricycle.
Tricycle. Yeah, I thought tricycle, yeah.
So, guys, yeah, this...
Sometimes these guys, you see them,
they have like three passengers.
Like two will be in this.
There's barely enough room for me.
Two will be in this
and then one will be
on the back of the bike.
And sometimes you see even more than that.
You'll see three skinny people
or two adults and a kid
in the back here.
And then another two, another two there,
he could easily take
like five people, you know.
We've stopped at Petron.
To get some petrol.
He pulls this down. Ah.
- It comes from up there? Okay.
- [Trike Driver 2]: Yes.
Ah okay, so he's gonna fill it with gas.
- [Petron Staff]: How much, my friend?
- [Trike Driver 2]: 50, 50, 50 pesos.
He's getting 50 pesos worth of gas.
[Petron Staff]: Hi, guys.
- [Petron Staff]: Hello.
- Hi, guys.
[Trike Driver 2]: Your YouTube channel?
[Trike Driver 2]: You got a YouTube channel?
Yeah, Dale Philip.
- [Petron Staff]: Where from, sir?
- Dale Philip from Scotland.
- [Petron Staff]: Scotland.
- Yes, thank you. Thank you.
We've been stuck in traffic
for about five minutes.
Unfortunately, these aren't like
the motorcycles
where they can just weave in
and out of the traffic.
When you take one of the motorbike taxis,
you get to skip all this.
But this is a bit too wide
to be able to do that.
To be able to navigate the lanes.
To filter through the
trucks and cars and such like,
and it's pretty
uncomfortable sitting here.
You're just getting all the exhaust fumes
from the big dirty vehicles
in front of you and suchlike.
etc. It's a bit hot.
When we're moving, it's good,
because you're getting the breeze
coming through there.
But when you're stuck like this,
it's just like
a bit uncomfortable, guys,
a bit uncomfortable.
This is like 4:30 PM in Manila.
This is, basically the whole city
is like with the traffic.
Ah, we're getting close.
I recognise this area.
- Is this Binondo?
- [Trike Driver 2]: Yes, Binondo.
Yeah, we're in Binondo right now.
So we're close,
we're right beside Divisoria.
- [Trike Driver 2]: Binondo.
- Yeah, this is Binondo.
- [Trike Driver 2]: Yeah.
- The Chinatown.
In fact, it's the oldest Chinatown
in the world, guys.
Filipino-Chinese Friendship Arch
right here.
Check it out, the Jollibee
even has a Chinese sign.
I guess that's Jollibee
written in Chinese.
there, in Chinese characters.
- [Trike Driver 2]: Right here, sir?
- Okay.
- [Trike Driver 2]: Divisoria Market.
Yeah, here is good, here's good.
I can walk from here. Yeah.
- [Trike Driver 2]: Yes, sir.
- Yeah, okay, it's good right here.
Okay, this for you, brother.
Take 300, okay?
[Trike Driver 2]:
Okay. Thank you very much, sir.
Okay, no worries.
- [Trike Driver 2]: Nice to meet you, my friend.
- Have a safe journey back.
Okay, guys we are here in Divisoria.
Okay, I'm going to have a wander around.
In fact, I think there's a 7-Eleven
around here somewhere.
I'm gonna get myself
a refreshing drink first.
Hello, police.
Hello, good afternoon.
- [Policeman]: I want to meet my friend.
- Oh, beautiful.
- [Policeman]: Yeah.
- Zaragoza.
- [Policeman]: Yeah.
- That's her name?
- [Policeman]: Yeah.
- That's a beautiful name, Zaragoza.
Okay.
So you are looking after Divisoria,
keeping it safe?
- [Policeman]: Yes.
- Okay, it's good.
Okay, we're getting a selfie with Zaragoza.
Okay, good.
Nice to see you, take care.
- How are you? Okay, that's good.
- [Guy]: Take care of your camera.
He told me to take care of my camera.
I've got like eight policemen
and two police women
looking after me right there.
So that's good, for anybody who's worried
about coming down this area.
You know there are police
looking out for you and suchlike.
This is my second time here,
and the first time I was here,
I didn't see anything
that would make me think
this place was dangerous.
Oh, that got my attention.
About to...
Am I about to turn into Homer Simpson
and just start munching donuts?
No.
Mission. What's my mission?
Well, my main mission
is to find the baseball cap.
But my immediate
side quest right now is to find a 7-Eleven
to enjoy a nice cold Coke Zero
before I start my hunt
for said baseball cap, guys.
That looks good right there, that fan.
I want to find
one of them that can like attach to myself
and just blow on me the whole time.
And refresh me.
So I have seen a lot of guys
selling drinks
out of these carts, right here.
But,
I have another reason I need to go to 7-Eleven.
I gave that trike driver
the rest of my change,
the last of my change.
So I only have 1,000 notes left,
so I'm gonna have to break them down.
Thank you.
Okay.
Let's see.
This is the Coke Zero section right here,
and they do have my favourite
when I'm in the Philippines,
the vanilla one.
It is nice and cold.
Mission, successful, guys.
- [7-Eleven Staff]: Sir, do you have smaller...
- That's all I got.
It's all I got.
So...
Yeah, if even 7-Eleven don't want
to take a 1,000,
imagine what it's gonna be like
in the market stalls and suchlike
trying to get change
for like a baseball cap
that's like 100,
200, or something.
So yeah,
I just thought of that in advance.
Solve that problem right away.
Along with my thirst problem.
Struggling for change and he's got
a big bag of coins right there.
Hopefully, that's not going
to end up in my pocket.
Hopefully, that's not gonna be
my change for my thousand.
Okay, I'm just getting a few coins.
Okay, thank you so much.
- [7-Eleven Staff]: Thank you.
- Thank you
Thank you po, thank you.
Okay, guys, Coke Zero acquired.
Aah.
Refreshing.
Okay, now the main mission,
the reason I'm here,
let's go and find yer man
a brand new baseball cap.
Hey, how are you?
- [Guy]: I'm fine.
- Good. I'm glad that you are fine.
Now, I think I'm gonna head
into one of the malls.
One of the nice air-conditioned malls.
There's a ton of them.
And they just sell the same things
that they're selling out on the street.
But it's a lot more comfortable
to walk around.
I think down down here.
You see what I was saying
about these trikes,
how they can take
like five people sometimes.
And look at this trike.
Oh, he's carrying a lot of stuff.
So he's using it for transport
for delivering to probably
one of the shops.
And he's basically
got as much stuff loaded on that
as he possibly could take.
Bags of rice and stuff,
all the heavy stuff there.
And then on top,
the plastic cups and stuff.
Very good.
Okay.
Yeah.
I thought he was driving
for a second there,
the little kid, he's on the front.
It's his dad behind him
that's doing the driving.
Yeah, like four or five people
in every one of these trikes.
And I see here, Divisoria Mall.
So that's where I started
the last time I came to this market,
and it was nice inside,
nice and air-conditioned,
and lots of stuff.
That's where I'm going.
So these guys are all packing up.
It's maybe like 5:30 or something,
5, 5:30, and...
Yeah, this all gets shut down
by the time it gets dark at night.
I think the malls stay open
a bit longer though.
Hello po.
- [Security Guard]: Sir.
- Can't go in? What?
- [Security Guard 2]: Face mask.
- Face mask, need? Ah, okay.
- [Security Guard 2]: No filming inside.
- No filming inside, okay.
That's two reasons
why I can't come to this mall then.
- [Security Guard]: You a vlogger?
- Yeah, vlogger, vlogger.
Nice to see you.
Okay.
I've never been --
I've even been in like the biggest
malls in the Philippines,
like the Mall of Asia,
nobody's ever asked me
to put a face mask on.
And nobody's ever stopped me filming.
I'm sure I could have like
put the camera away,
put a face mask on,
if I had one, which I don't,
got inside,
and then taken the face mask off
and turned the camera back on.
That would have been
easy enough to do but...
I'll just either go to another mall
or I'll just use another entrance.
There's like multiple entrances
to this big mall right here.
In fact there's one around that corner.
Okay, I'm in. That was easy.
I just came in
through that entrance right there.
They didn't,
they're didn't say anything
about the face mask
and the camera was in my pocket, so.
This one has a lot of jerseys right here,
all basketball jerseys.
They've got absolutely tons.
No football though.
I'm not looking for football today.
That was mission impossible.
I learned my lesson,
don't go hunting for football shirts.
Although, I found that the way to buy
the Philippine National Football top
is through Shopee.
That's the only place you can buy it.
There's some website, Shopee,
it's like Lazada.
It's like the...
Lazada and Shopee
are like the Filipino or Thai
kind of some Asian country's
version of Amazon.
So, you can get it off that.
I have put in an order
and I'm getting it delivered to
a hotel that
I'm going to be staying in in the future.
I'm trying to time it right with delivery.
There's quite a long lead time
for the delivery.
So I might have wasted my money
or I might have a package
turning up at a future hotel
with the Philippines National
Football top in it.
We shall see.
Anyway, guys, I'm not seeing
any baseball caps.
Surely, surely there is somebody
who specialises in them.
Hello, how are you?
- [Guy]: Hey.
- Hi.
I'm looking for baseball caps.
Anybody have a lot of baseball caps?
No.
Okay, I think he doesn't
speak English so he's shy but...
I'm sure baseball cap
is also the Filipino word.
They have baseball caps
but they're doing custom,
like custom make.
Yeah, he's got like
an embroidery machine there
and he does custom.
Customise?
Ah okay, you can do baseball caps?
Ah.
You can do a baseball cap
with Filipino flag?
[Vendor]: Name only.
Only name, ah okay. Not pattern?
No? Okay, thank you.
Okay, I thought it might be nice
if I could get him
to put the Philippines flag
on a baseball cap for me.
But that doesn't seem to be an option.
Okay, it's a lot of party goods
around here, guys.
I'll go back to the ground floor.
I think there was more clothes down there.
Oh, they have baseball caps right here.
They got a lot of baseball caps.
- [Vendor]: Hello.
- Hi, how are you?
Is this your shop?
How are you?
Shy, that's how you are. You're shy.
Yeah.
How much are your caps? How much?
- Pesos?
- [Vendor 2]: Which one?
Like these kind, here.
- [Vendor]: Ah, 150.
- 150.
Okay. So that is like,
that is like $2.50 or something,
$2.50 for these ones right here.
Okay, so you've got a lot of selection.
Let's see if I can find one that I like.
Oh, this is cool. Jeep with the camo.
They've got some camo ones here.
If you're getting camo,
I think Jeep would be the best one,
not Fila or Adidas.
How are you?
Oh, we've got an audience.
- [Vendor 2]: I'm fine.
- Hi, okay.
[Vendor 2]: Sorry. Which one?
Which one do you think looks good for me?
Which one do you think looks good?
Why so shy?
Why so shy?
[Vendor 3]: She as a thick face.
[Vendor 2]: Sorry.
Yeah, which one do you think
will be good for me?
[Vendor 2]: Maybe... it's good for you,
maybe this one.
Which one?
These ones? This is very... progressive.
- [Vendor 2]: Expensive looking.
- Expensive. Yeah, Prada Milano, ah yeah.
[Vendor 2]: Expensive,
but it's a good quality.
This...
Your country is too hot
to wear a wool hat.
Too hot, too hot.
This for winter, for cold country.
Not for hot and sweaty Philippines.
Yeah, so these are all designer ones here.
They've got like Louis Vuitton,
Gucci, Chanel.
All these luxury brands.
Oh, and all the luxury brands
are ending up on the floor.
[Vendor]: Oh my God.
Sorry, I'm destroying --
[Vendor 2]: Oh my God, it's dirty,
you have to pay now.
No. Now, she's saying now I have to pay.
She said I have to buy it now
because I dropped it on the floor.
I would look like a complete D-bag
wearing a Gucci.
Anybody wearing like a big logo like that,
with Gucci on it or anything,
is a complete D-bag, so.
[Vendor 2]: Oh, it's dirty,
so you have to pay now.
It's not. Look how clean it is, look.
Where? Where is it the dirt?
Where is the dirt?
It's so clean.
[Vendor 2]:
No, because you changed the smell.
Where? Where? Where? Where? Where?
It's clean, it's still clean.
Okay, she's just joking.
Oh, so they got the Hermes.
Ah.
All that stuff, basically,
every luxury brand is here.
I don't like any of this stuff, guys.
Like I say, when I see somebody
wearing stuff like this,
I'm just like...
"What a D-bag."
I prefer like the sport stuff.
I think I'm gonna just take --
this is the one that I liked. Hi.
You're calling me?
- [Vendor 3]: What's your vlog?
- Dale Philip.
[Vendor 4]: Dale Philip?
-Yes, Dale Philip.
- [Vendor 4]: Yeah, I know you.
You don't know me.
Otherwise, you wouldn't
have had to ask my name.
- [Vendor 4]: I just saw you right now.
- [Vendor 2]: That's why.
Everybody says that.
They're like, "What's your name?"
They're like, "Oh, I know you."
If you knew it,
you wouldn't have to ask my name.
So I don't get it.
But guys, these caps right here,
that was the first one
that caught my eye, the Jeep one.
So I think that's probably
what I'm gonna,
what I'm probably gonna get.
I'll have a quick look.
- I'm from Scotland. Where are you from?
[Vendor 5]: Scotlando?
- Where are you from?
- Philippines, Philippines.
Yeah, where in the Philippines?
- [Vendor]: Baseco.
- [Vendor 4]: Parola
- [Vendor 2]: Baseco.
Where?
- [Vendor 4]: Parola. Oh.
- I don't know this place.
[Vendor 2]: Sir, because you touched it two times,
so you have to buy.
- Every one I touch I have to buy?
- [Vendor 2]: Yes.
I've touched like two dozen of them, so.
I've touched like two dozen of them.
Okay, I'm going to get
this Jeep one right here.
- Yeah, camouflage. Yeah.
[Vendor]: Army camouflage.
Let's see if I can get this off.
Okay.
The Jeep one.
Jeep camo.
Do you think
this will look good for me or no?
- [Vendor 5]: Yes.
- [Vendor 3]: Yeah, good, sir, good.
- Good? Okay, can you hold? I will try.
- [Vendor 2]: You have to buy now.
What, this one?
If i like it.
[Vendor 2]: Only one?
You have to buy a lot and give to...
She said I have to buy a lot
and give for gifts.
This is good.
It's nice and thin, it's nice and thin.
So I need something like that
for the hot weather.
I didn't want like the big fluffy one
with the wool or whatever.
Okay, Jeep camo hat.
Oh yeah, it's perfect, perfect.
Yeah, it fits perfect.
What do you think, guys?
Jeep camo hat.
Right here.
Okay, 150, yeah? Okay.
[Vendor 2]:
Yeah, you have to pay 150. Only one?
- Yeah, only one just now, maybe --
[Vendor 2]:
I thought you're gonna buy 100 pieces.
Maybe I will come back
another time and buy more.
- [Vendor 2]: Only 150.
- Okay.
- [Vendor 2]: Thank you so much.
- Okay.
[Vendor 2]: You want me to subscribe you?
Oh, you can subscribe me.
Okay, write down my name.
[Vendor 2]: Sure.
- [Vendor 2]: Insha'Allah.
- Insha'Allah? Are you a Muslim?
- [Vendor 2]: No.
- Why did you say "Insha'Allah" then?
- [Vendor 2]: I know how to speak.
- You lived in Dubai before or something?
- [Vendor 2]: Yes, you're right. Yeah.
- You're working in Dubai before, yeah.
Okay.
[Vendor 2]: Why you shaking?
You make me nervous?
[Vendor 2]:
Why, you don't have to -- oh.
Yes, that's my name. You can subscribe.
- YouTube and Facebook, okay?
- [Vendor 2]: Sure.
Thank you so much. Thank you, girls.
Thank you so much.
Okay, good.
Okay, good.
There we go, mission complete.
I guess I need to find
some more camo clothes to go with it,
like the full,
the full gear, full camo gear to go about.
And I don't know if like then
you get accused
of impersonating the army
or something but...
Yeah, I'm happy with this cap.
It's something unique.
All my other caps are like Adidas,
Nike.
- [Boy]: Hey, man.
- Hey.
Like Oakley,
like that kind of sport brands.
I've never had anything like this,
so yer man is happy.
Now, I'm going to see
if I can maybe find myself
a nice cold drink or something.
- Usually, on the top of these malls --
- [Vendors]: Hello. Hi.
Hi, how are you? Nice to see you.
Very cute.
Okay, usually, on the tops of these malls,
the top floor, there'll be a food court.
So, that's how you reward yourself, guys.
You come here with a mission
to find something you want,
you complete your mission.
Hello, hi.
You complete your mission,
and then you go reward yourself
with a nice sweet treat.
And that's what I'm gonna do right now.
Let's head to the food court.
You have the Mango Graham Fudge Sundae?
[Jollibee Crew]: Yes, sir. We have.
Yeah, I want one please
and Coca-Cola Zero.
- [Jollibee Crew]: Coke Zero.
- Thank you.
- [Jollibee Crew]:
109, sir. I received 1,000.
- Hi.
- [Jollibee Manager]: Hello.
- How are you?
- [Jollibee Manager]: I'm fine.
Okay, good.
[Jollibee Crew]: One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight hundred,
- [Jollibee Crew]: and 91.
- Okay, thank you so much, Maurice.
- [Jollibee Crew]: Thank you, sir.
- Yes, Maurice.
- [Jollibee Crew 2]: How are you, sir?
- This is -- good, thank you.
He's named after Maurice Johnston.
This is like a famous
Scottish football player,
a legendary Scottish football player,
Maurice Johnston.
Sir, four minutes for Mango Graham.
Four minutes. Okay, I will wait over here.
Okay, thank you.
Do I take one of these or no?
- No.
- [Jollibee Crew]: I call you, sir.
Oh, you will call me.
Thank you, Maurice. Maurice Johnston.
- [Jollibee Crew]: Here, sir.
- Oh, thank you, Maurice.
- This is Maurice Johnston here.
- [Jollibee Cew]: Yeah.
Football player, you know him?
- From Scotland. Maurice Johnston.
- [Jollibee Crew]: Yes.
That's who he's named after, guys,
Maurice Johnston.
- Thank you.
- [Jollibee Crew]: Thank you, sir.
Okay we've got
the Mango Graham Fudge Sundae right here.
Fantastic.
I'm gonna just...
Oh.
Oh, it's so good, those graham.
Those graham crackery crunchy bits
with the chewy sweet mango,
the chocolate sauce, the ice cream,
delicious.
Mmm.
Ah, lovely.
Nice and refreshed.
Yer man, feeling good
and is now
going to head back to his hotel.
But it is now 5:30 PM.
I've just checked the time.
5:31 PM.
So the traffic will be about as bad
as it could possibly be in Manila.
I think there's zero chance
I'm getting back to my hotel by,
by a Grab or anything.
I won't even get picked up,
so I think I'm going to walk it.
It's like 50 minutes walk to my hotel
according to Google Maps.
I think I'm just gonna take a sunset walk
through the streets of Manila
back to my hotel.
These streets are a lot more
comfortable to walk in
now that the sun has gone down,
a lot of people have cleared out,
it's more peaceful.
There's more space,
less traffic, less heat.
Yeah.
It's just nicer
to walk around at this time.
Now, there should be a bridge
around about here.
that takes us over to Intramuros.
I've taken this bridge before.
Hello, how are you?
Yes.
I think around this way.
Hi, how are you?
- [Man]: Fine, thank you.
- Nice to see you, nice to see you.
Hi, hello.
- [Boy]: Hey, what's your name?
- Hi, guys, my name is Dale.
- [Boy]: Dale Philip?
- Pleased to meet you.
- [Boy]: Dale Philip!
- Yes, Dale Philip. Yes, Dale Philip.
He know, he knows, he knows me.
- [Boys]: Yeah! Yeah! Yey!
- He knows me, Dale Philip. Yeah, good!
- [Boy 2]: What's your name?
- Dale Philip. He knows, he knows.
- Yes, you're Dale Philip.
- Yes, I'm Dale Philip. He knows.
Okay, good.
That's good. Okay.
Hi, how are you?
No, I don't need no chilies. No, no.
- [Boy 3]: Filipino.
- Filipino, yeah, good. Manila.
- [Boy 2]: Hey, give me money.
Mabuhay, mabuhay Philippines.
Mabuhay, mabuhay Philippines.
- [Boy 2]: Give me money.
- No, you give me money.
- [Boy 2]: Please, give me money.
- No, you give me money.
No, you give me, you give me. You give me.
[Boy]: Philip, Philip.
Okay, guys, okay.
I'm gonna cross the bridge.
Nice to see you, guys.
Okay have I made a mistake here?
Is this only for cars?
It looks like a big
kind of like motorway bridge here.
I just seen it on Google Maps.
I don't think it's the same bridge
that I crossed the last time.
Oh yeah, there is a path.
I think...
I see people walking anyway,
I think we can walk it.
Yeah, this is definitely
a different bridge.
The last bridge I crossed was the
new bridge.
It was the Binondo-Intramuros
Chinese-Filipino Friendship Bridge,
I believe.
I don't remember seeing all this.
It looks like people are living here.
Yeah, this is like people's homes
that are like...
I guess informally built.
Like they probably
don't own the land and such like that.
They've just kind of like built this.
And they're squatting on the land.
I see like this type of thing
in Bangkok well.
Beside the Chao Phraya River.
They have these kind of homes.
Basically, like a shanty town
that's set up.
You know, just in any space
that they can find, so.
Yeah, looks like this is
the Manila version of that.
Ah there, guys, right there.
That's the Binondo-Intramuros Bridge,
the Chinese-Filipino Friendship Bridge.
That's the one that I took the last time.
Hi, guys, nice to see you.
Yeah.
That was it over there.
So Intramuros is there.
So we're gonna be walking right past
Intramuros.
That's the point
where you can get to in Intramuros.
When you enter the fort,
there's like that little bit where people
have picnics and such like that.
Right there.
Yeah.
You see the homes here,
built right on the edge
of the river.
I think I basically just need
to keep walking straight,
and I'm going to end up in Malate
where my hotel is.
According to Google Maps anyway,
it's just a straight line from here.
But I'm enjoying this.
This is a good time to be walking around.
Almost sunset, guys,
here at Manila.
Just a little bit nicer, calmer,
and cooler to be walking about.
The traffic is crazy.
Some guys cheating,
some guys cheating the traffic there,
because look at it, guys.
It's just mayhem.
But...
When you've got two strong legs, guys.
When you got two strong legs,
you don't have to worry
about the traffic, do you?
50 minutes on Google Maps.
Maybe half an hour for yer man,
we'll be back in the hotel relaxing.
No idea how to get across this bit.
It's like big roundabout
with a statue in the middle.
Something "Simon" something "Anda."
I don't know what that's for right there,
but I know it's...
I couldn't find a way around.
So I've just come across
the middle of it, right here.
According to Google Maps anyway,
I'm supposed to go in a straight line.
How are you? High five.
- [Man]: Hi.
- High five, good.
Okay, yeah.
I'm supposed to go in a straight line
so that's what I'm doing.
Even if the straight line takes me across
like seven lanes of traffic.
That didn't work there.
Okay.
This better work
otherwise I'm not getting past --
Okay, thank you, sorry.
And this right here, guys,
is the golf course outside Intramuros.
That's Intramuros there.
You can see the walls.
You can see the old walls
of the old walled city right there.
Some of the university students
hanging out.
There's a boy and a girl having a wee kiss
and a cuddle right there.
Two university students.
And then the golfers there
golfing on this reclaimed land.
This was all reclaimed land
because Intramuros,
the walls used to go right out
onto the sea.
So where we're standing right now,
in the days of old,
when the Spanish were here,
this would have been water.
We wouldn't have been able
to go for a stroll,
a stroll down this... this street.
Okay.
I think that was for me,
that beep, beep, beep, beep.
And this, I don't know
if this is supposed to be a pedestrian...
like a like a running track
or for bicycles, or whatever,
but it seems like
a lot of motorbikes are using it
to, you know, avoid the traffic.
And we're back
at another familiar place, guys.
It's the Jose
Rizal Park and Monument right there.
That is Rizal
standing proudly there.
The Nationalist, the Filipino Nationalist.
Jose Rizal.
And this is very close
to my hotel down here.
There, will be the...
Hi, how are you?
There will be the American Embassy,
and then the Dolomite Beach,
and then my hotel is nearly there.
So I'm glad I walked this.
It wasn't too difficult to walk.
It looks like there's a wee night market
or something there.
Hmm.
Mercato Central, it's called.
Maybe I'll check that out just now.
Aye, fantastic.
There's somebody
selling drinks right there.
That's what I'm after.
Here we go. This all looks good.
Iced tea, lemon, lemonade, blue lemonade,
cucumber, red iced tea,
I'm gonna get this,
the blue lemonade.
Blue lemonade please.
[Vendor]: What size, sir?
- Big one, big one. Yeah, large.
- Big one, like large.
- Yeah, that's what she said.
- [Vendor]: Large.
Who's the boss for the money?
This the boss?
Boss man, okay.
- [Vendor]: He's the boss.
- The boss. Okay.
- [Vendor]: He's a dog.
- He's what?
- [Vendor]: Dog.
- Dog?
Oh, that's very rude, it's very rude.
Thank you po, thank you.
Okay, we get a plastic straw
as well, good.
- [Vendor 2]: Thanks, sir.
Thank you po.
Oh, nice and cold. Nice and cold, guys.
Mmm.
Yum.
And that was possibly the quickest visit
to a night market I've ever done, guys.
I was straight in, got my nice cold drink,
and was straight out.
Job done.
No messing about. And this is delicious.
Tastes like lemonade
with a wee bit of blueberry hint to it.
Wee bit of a blueberry hint.
Aah, good.
Anyway, guys.
I'm just gonna stroll back
to the hotel with this drink.
I'm gonna end the vlog here.
And then I'm gonna go for a swim.
I'm gonna repeat what I did yesterday.
I'm gonna go for a swim,
I'm gonna go to Denny's and get myself
an all-day breakfast again.
And then I'm gonna go for a massage.
And end of day that way.
But I'm ending the vlog right now, guys.
So, thank you for joining me
today and yesterday.
It's been another two-day vlog,
another two-day vlog by yer man.
Thanks for joining me.
I'll see you on the next adventure.
Peace!
