In every stage of our lives we need to break free
and join the very isolated islands around the world
Guys, The Philippines
where I first start my YouTube Carreer
Ones must go back to the begennings to see and learn
That's how he can compare ... How was the first trip?
and how we arrived to this point?
We started from a very modest country, which is
...
The Phelippines
Guys, we"re heading toward the airport now
and going to The Maldives
The most beautiful islands in the world
Between all the world's islands, The Maldives has always the top ranking
Just like the most famous brands: Nike, Adidas, Apple, and Marcedes
Do you see this iPhone, Guys?
A very strong name and there's no island in the world ...
We have the biggest Villa
... can compete with it
Today, we're going to approach it to The Phelippines
There's a personal Gym ...
We're going to synchronize, The Maldives and The Philippines trips together in one video
Let's go to Coron
Don't forget to like this video and SUBSCRIBE to the Channel, Guys
Let's GO
Guys, we've just arrived to Coron
This island is considered more beautiful then The Maldives
I don't know yet ... I have to check out
We are in a hotel in the mid-town
You can see the sea right in front of you
Our tour tomorrow will be in
a boat, this boat will take us in a tour around the islands
we booked a privte tour
Just to be able to film in our ease 
They will show us the whole island
In fact, it's an archipago
Coron
In order to move an island to the other one ... You need boats
Waw
Coron Island is a Municipality in the  province of Palawan
And Palawan is the archipelago that contains El Nidi city, that we had visited three years ago
Today, this area is a little far
It's almost between the Capital Manila and the big Island of Palawan
It's in between and, El Nido has an airport
But you can reach it by boat that it will take 7 to 8 hours
But by airplane, you can arrive there in less than one hour
What this island hide from us?
The Coron island is the most beautiful in the world
Guys, this is our start
Just from the sea
We've just walked
from the hotel
to the nearby sea
We're going to try a move, wait to see
which is flying the drone through this tuk-tuk
Tuk-Tuk not Tik Tok ðŸ˜‚
we're flying the drone through this Tuk-Tuk
How was it? was it successful or not, tell me in the comment ... but listen Guys
Do you know how those people live in this little part of a taken away paradise
very far from the crowd
They play Basketball, they just lives their lives
but not far away
The Paradise
This is Coron's market
magandang
magandang umaga
Good moring Guys
this is our second day in Coron
Today is the day
We'r going to discover this island
without the boat's tour we will never know this island ... ever
Good moring Guys
We'll take the boat just for us
We have the whole day to discover all the islands around this area
The Coron area
Let's Go
Is it more beautiful than the Maldives? YES
more than the Maldives? YES
Apparently, we're going to stop over every place just to swim
This is the first spot
See? ... swim and then
go to the next destination
The more you go deep the cleaner become the water like the Crystal
What's this. How lucky is fish who lives here?
This is another spot
look at the water?
look at this color? it's so breathtaking
Okay Guys, we stopped in this island
this where we are going to have our lunch
Here, it's all seafood
When you take a private tour you can stop wherever you want
or omit any place you want
even it's more expensive but better
every island is more beautiful than the other one
The rain is so heavy that make our vision so limited
You know that this area was
a Battle area during the World War
this area is so famous
you can even find Sunken ships
Shipwreck of more than 50 years old ships
from the WWII time
Looks like Magic
The islands so far are fascinating
The difference is
here is way cheaper than The Maldives
and you can feel the living with the locals
better than being in a tourist attraction areas
This island where we are now is uninhabited
Imagine, you wake up like this, in middle of the ocean?
This is exactly where you can match your honeymoon and your adventure
There in the Maldives, you feel it's so over relaxing.
There's no annoyance, so many services offered
Five-star services.
But here needs more impovement
Imagine going with your friends there?
The next day, you'll get bored
But here you do not get bored at all
every day has an activity to do
every day in a different island
It's like he's taking us to a very special place
not very known
It's very similar to the previous one but it contains a beautiful lake
we're trying to reach it
See, this place
it's called the twin lagoon
lagoons are those rocks
The twin lagoons entrance
you can penetrate directly from there
it's a secret
entrance
very secret one
I'm trying to go film in there
I think this is how our day will end
just this cave is left for us to go through
this cave is so profound
Okay Guys, Good Morning
This is our second day in Coron Island
This time we're going to try something different
not having a tour around the islands but
but we're going to see some amazing places like a forest
and a river passing through it
