and now if you're asking yourself aaron 
are you gonna eat all of that food  
and the answer is yeah i'm gonna eat all this 
food i'm in another country and i don't have a  
girlfriend and i'm lonely okay i'm depressed you 
know so today i woke up it's a rainy manila day  
i woke up and i was like man i'm feeling depressed 
and as an overweight you could say bad american  
the only thing that i thought that would make me 
feel better is that's fast food jollibee to be  
specific so what i'm going to do is i'm going to 
go in here and i'm going to try out the jollibee
oh thank god they don't have music in 
here i'm actually shocked that there's  
no music in here right now otherwise 
i want to be able to film in here
you know so i'm sitting here waiting in 
line thinking about what i should order  
i think what i'm going to do is i'm going 
to order a bunch of different things  
i'm just going to try a bunch of them i wasn't 
going to do that but i think that's the best bet
can i get a super meal super 
meal one cheesy classic
spicy clove it's just the hot dog yeah the 
cheesy classic hot dog super meal what's better
the filipino root beer thai is a filipino brand 
ah no is that filipino it's rc filipino brand  
yes okay yeah i can have sarcasm sir and 
then um what's the most popular burger  
what's the most popular burger uh chicken sandwich 
this is the most popular yeah i'll get the uh here
and these are you want two oh that one oh okay 
okay all right i'll take the i'll take the chance  
now champ yeah yeah so yes 
yes over here please what else
i'm hungry
okay so i think i got the whole menu cover 
because the super meals got the chicken  
it's got steak the rice gravy and the spaghetti 
and then i got a burger and then i got a cheese  
dog and then one of the desserts okay so here's 
this real map i was telling you about right here  
so 1100 locations according to this they 
serve a million pieces of chicken a day  
they have one in brunei which is like this tiny 
island nation on on borneo there's three countries  
on the island but i personally have had jollibee 
in in the u.s in california and washington state  
but i drove by one in arizona and i've never 
had it here in the philippines and everyone says  
that it's much better in the philippines so it's 
gonna be my first time trying in the philippines  
so i'll have to see okay baby here we go so i 
got the super meal it's got chicken uh he has  
burger spaghetti and then the gravy with the rice 
and then i think this is saucy i think i think  
this is a filipino brand that's why i got it i 
think it's like filipino beer and then here is  
the cheese dog and then i got an ube cheese pie 
and then i guess i got a burger too and i guess  
that's coming right now so let's try this stuff 
out all right first we're gonna start off with  
this chicken with jollibee chicken well that's 
nice oh it's a little salty it's obviously fried  
chicken so it's got the little crispy skin 
on the outside of course here's the jollibee  
spaghetti they got the little hot dogs in there 
and there's sauce here that they use it's kind of  
like a sweet like ketchup kind of almost okay 
here we go here's the spaghetti big bite here  
so spaghetti is cold but tastes good 
i don't really know i've never had  
spaghetti that tastes like that before i 
like that it's got the hot dog in there man
here we got some hamburger with some 
gravy on it i think this is beef  
beef patty pretty sure this is beef
not bad pretty tender  
it's got some mushrooms on it and the gravy next 
up we got the cheese dog now i'm not gonna lie  
this looks a little different than it did in the 
photo and that's pretty much most restaurants so  
the cheesy classic here we go
i like that oh yeah it's got 
some mustard ketchup the cheese  
it's got sweetness to it man that's a good 
hot dog oh yeah i forgot about the sarsi
it kind of tastes like a root beer like almost 
like a licorice that's what it is it tastes kind  
of like a licorice root beer not too sweet either 
it's not too sweet finally we got the big champ  
i actually don't even know what's in 
this double wrapper well this one's  
hot it's fresh oh that feels nice we got some 
cheese some cheese some lettuce some tomato
obviously i'm assuming this is beef  
all right let's see everybody plastic burger 
always got the sesame seed bun on there the  
iceberg lettuce cheesy warm got the beef obviously 
pretty saucy which i personally love my burger  
sausage some people aren't a big fan of sauce i 
love the sauce i've almost made a fatal mistake  
for all you dessert lovers out there i got the ube 
cheese pie this one says mango peach so hopefully  
it's not that because i ordered the ube cheese 
they're little little desserts so let's try it out
oh yeah that's good okay they finally just turned 
on the music i gotta wrap up this video but this  
is good it's got the ube and the cheddar cheese 
in there it's an interesting combo i'd almost say  
that's kind of savory you know i woke up this 
morning it was raining i needed some jolliness  
and i came and i found it here at charlie 
oh that was good i i will say it does  
i think it does taste different i don't know 
honestly the last time i had jollibee was like  
three years ago maybe back home and people 
always say it's better in the philippines so  
i mean it's good i liked it it would be wet or 
hot it was a little cold i'm not gonna lie it  
would be much better if it was hot all right so 
there you go the honest review of the jollibee i  
had to come and do it i honestly forgot somebody 
said it actually kim if you're watching this she  
put in the comment you need to go to jollibee 
and i was like oh my god you're right i didn't  
need to go to jamaica so i'm gonna go ahead 
and just uh finish all this food right now
okay so here it is i didn't really eat it 
all but here's the damage too much food  
more for the video i thought i was gonna eat it 
all i know i'm fat i'm not that fat there you have  
it the beloved jollibee the number one fast food 
in the philippines i'm stuffed that was too much  
all that cost 435 by the way which that's a lot of 
that's a lot of jollibee that's too much honestly  
so anyways i hope you enjoyed 
this video thank you for watching  
the rain has stopped now i can walk 
home and we'll see you next time
you
