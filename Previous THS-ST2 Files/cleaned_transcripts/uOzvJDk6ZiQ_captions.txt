Can you hear my mom talking?
She's talking to someone, I'm sorry if you can hear her.
I'm Kenzo, and I'm a high school student here in Japan
and what happens in our school
The other day I posted something in my Instagram stories
and I asked my followers to 
send me their questions about school
and my life here as a high school student
And we're gonna answer those today
Please follow me on Instagram, this is my username
Hang on where should I position myself?
I guess here
Maybe here
I don't know if I can mention the name of my school
but it's somewhere here in Tokyo
Actually, all subjects here are taught in Japanese
And to be honest, we are the third batch of foreign students
We're only the third batch because 3-4 years ago,
there weren't any foreign students yet 
therefore this system is just new
Even our English subject is taught using Japanese 
and I don't know why
But I guess it's more effective that way for them
"Are there honors in Japan?"
Here in our school, there aren't any
There are no honors or special awards, but there are rankings
But the honors where they give you medals and stuff
Nope, there aren't any here I'm not sure why
I guess that is to prevent people from being grade conscious
That isn't a big deal to them anyway
But they give certain medals to students who 
participate in inter-school competitions
Those who win and get like gold, and bronze medals
"Does your school have a volleyball varsity team?"
Yes we do
Actually all sports do
If you're not aware of the schools in Japan,
It's more of academics, and clubs or varsities
They consider varsities here as clubs
So it's only academics and sports
That is the general focus of high school life here
That is what they tell us before too
"If you go to this school, what will you work hard on, 
what will you persevere to do?"
I don't know why sports is such a big deal in high schools here
nathaliedesma asked: "Do you really need to be good at kanji 
before going to a Japanese school?"
Yes, you need to know some kanji 
especially if you're a foreigner
Because if you don't know any kanji..
You can't understand anything
As for myself, I had to learn Japanese in a 
language school before entering high school
for about 6-7 months I think
Even though I learned some kanji there, it's still not enough
When I entered into my high school, that's where I 
realized and learned the most common and useful kanji
Like really
It's very different because the kanji that
 they taught us in language school,
they're more on the practical ones
that you use daily outside of school
so they don't really do much help with 
the words that are used in school
"Hi Kenzo! Who was your first friend when 
you first started school in Japan?"
Leyanne, Keiji, and others were already my friends before
because we went to the same language school
If you haven't seen my first Q&A video,
I answered what school we went to
And that's where we all met each other
But my first friend who was Japanese,
I'd say it was Arashi
Because he was sitting behind me in class
I also became friends with Ibuki, the one in front of me
Yeah
He's very friendly
We had a group during out first year in high school
Nowadays most of us in the group don't talk to each other
But I'm still very close with Arashi
In first year, the worst subject..
The one I disliked the most
was biology (生物 - seibutsu)
Because there were tons of stuff to memorize
And I admit that I don't understand any of the terms
I really had a hard time
Hang on, maybe you're getting scared
That's the reality, yes it's hard at first
And yeah I failed biology class
(just biology?)
- And I'll tell you how I overcame that in the next question
That's the most difficult, also the teacher 
was very hard to deal with (bitchy)
He's a guy, but he's weird
Yup, there are weird teachers here and I don't know why
"What happens if you fail a subject?"
When I failed, they didn't give me summer classes
But they gave me extra work assignments 
that I have to answer, after school
But the answers are already there, I just have to copy them
Like "the correct answers are here, just note them down"
and they're all in kanji
Think about in biology, like 
"what are the different parts of a cell?"
Of course all of those have Japanese terms
So how am I supposed to memorize all that?
That's where I struggled the most because of the kanji
But in time, I got used to it
When I see the characters often, I can remember them
Yeah, I eventually know how to read and write them
And that's it, they gave me extra work to accomplish in 5 days
And it saved my grades
"How much is your allowance/lunch money in school?"
Shoutout to my mom: thank you for the 
￥1,000 per week (about $9)
Yeah, my weekly allowance is 1,000 yen, sometimes none
That's also because I have packed lunch
￥1,000 here is around ₱450-500
"Rate your comfort rooms (rest rooms)"
Hi guys, I'm pooping
My stomach hurts since last night
So first subject, I have LBM
So far they're okay, they're clean
They just don't have heaters for your butt
My ass gets cold when I poop in winter
Yeah my ass gets a little cold when I poop during winter
Which is why I avoid doing that during winter
"Are the students there friendly? Please give me a shout out"
They're friendly to you..
If you're friendly to them
I'm kidding
They're friendly but they aren't usually the 
type who initiate a conversation
Unless you're actually friends, they'll ask questions and stuff
But usually, they don't start the conversation because
I guess they're shy, but yeah they're still friendly
I know a few of them
I don't know but maybe because in our batch,
 the foreign students are close to each other
From there I feel like the Japanese students don't like to..
They might feel like they're "feeling close"
with the foreign students
But that's actually not the case
When they have questions, they'll ask nicely
Maybe on my part, I can't keep up sometimes
There are stuff they talk about that I don't pick up immediately
So when they laugh I'll be like:
"What did he say?"
Scenarios like that
I'm like, OP (out of place)
"How did you feel on the first day of school
when you weren't close with anyone yet?"
During our first day, we had an opening ceremony
They had welcoming speeches and chants
I honestly don't remember but
yeah, we became friends immediately
Of course I was nervous that time
Because it's the first day, and I don't know anyone
I also didn't know our teacher
like "What are they saying? I just heard all of this now."
It was a weird feeling and I was confused
The high school that I'm in is purely for senior high students
So all of the students that enroll there
are going to be new students
So if you start there as a first year student, 
all of you might not know each other
Unless you came from the same junior high school
'Biggest scandal in your school"
I don't wanna say anything because..
But there is one that
okay, since y'all are nosey
Okay I'll share this but
(disclaimer: I'll just share this iconic moment)
If you happen to watch this, there's no tea and no hard feelings
The biggest scandal among our batch, but not the whole school
There was this foreign student
He recorded the teacher while he was being
 scolded and he posted it on instagram
Then the teacher found out
And it's not allowed here to record someone
 without his/her consent
It got worse because the post gave a bad
 impression on the teacher
to the students that follow him
Of course the teacher wouldn't want that
I'm not saying it was THAT bad but I think
 that was the biggest scandal that time
because I don't think there are any other
 big scandals in our school
The teacher was scolding him because
he wasn't following the rules
He was breaking some rules regarding proper hair and clothing
I don't know the specifics but
that is why the teacher got mad
So..yeah, we don't know if it is still safe
 to go to school but we still do
Why are you like this, Japan?
Why can't you have online classes?
As we all know, the number of COVID cases
 are rising in Japan, especially in Tokyo, where I'm at
And yeah, it's like a normal day here everyday
Except we're wearing masks, yeah
There's no social distancing
They have thermal cameras though
But they're not very accurate
Because when we walk to school, it's very cold outside
So our body temperatures are cold, at least in the forehead
therefore the scanners can't really tell the exact temperatures
We are just reminded to take care and all that
Aside from that, it's a normal school day
And then there was one time a student came in with COVID
but yeah, it can't be helped, hopefully others didn't catch it
but you won't really know if you have it until after 2 weeks
Oh and there are no big events like school 
festivals, competitions and stuff
Ones that have to do with huge crowds
"Have you tried skipping/ditching class? hehe"
Yes
I came in late
I woke up late so I skipped first class
Then I arrived in school during the break
 between 1st and 2nd class
Hmm I guess if you're Filipino
I guess not all but usually Filipinos are 
naturally friendly and talkative
But like me, I can get anxious when it comes to my Japanese
Like "Is my Japanese okay?"
And I always have to think about what I'll say
Then, it turns out I can't say anything 
because I was overthinking it
So for me, I realized this school year that
I should not overthink my Japanese
I can better express what I want to say when I use 
simple Japanese words rather than overthinking
And when making friends, just smile
even pointless topics
"Have you finished your assignments, quizzes, etc.?"
Of course it's normal to be shy
I mean, even they are shy
"What's one thing that you like about your 
school that the Philippines doesn't have?"
I guess it would be: We have PE thrice a week
In the Philippines we only have PE once a week
It's like we don't get exercise
But here, we have it three times a week and
 it's a different activity per school term
The only PE that I'm not a fan of is running
 because I'm not good at it
I also like our uniforms
Our school uniform and our PE uniforms, they're good
We look like
Swaggers
"What's the best part about being in a Japanese school?"
I guess it's the teachers, they're very kind
They're very caring, but not all of them
Majority of them are nice
especially to us foreign students
They always think about what is best and helpful for us
Because they understand that foreign students have it more 
difficult than the Japanese students
It's true that the foreign students kinda get special treatment,
and we're very thankful for that
We get special tests that are different from
 the standard Japanese school tests
Before exams, they give us sample test papers that 
we have to answer and they will check that
If those are correct, they will show up in the actual exams
What we have to do is just memorize those
The privilege we have as foreign students..
I'm not saying it's a big or grand privilege but
I'm very thankful for the support that our teachers give us
Is my camera crooked?
"I heard that your grade/year in school is 
based on your age, is that true?
I think that's not the case
but from what I know, there's a limit to the
age of students they accept in school
For our high school, the highest limit they accept is 18 years old
Someone also asked why I am 20 years old 
and still go to high school
So I entered my high school when I was 18
And I just turned 20 now
Currently I'm in my second year
If you wanna know why I'm 20 years old and still in 
high school, I answered it in a previous Q&A
Make sure you check that video out
"What's your worst experience in your school?"
My PE teacher in my first year,
He's very loud and he says a lot of mean stuff
I also feel like he's a bit racist
He treats us foreign students differently
During our PE classes, when there are words 
that I can't understand, he'll be like
"Oh you can't understand? That's 'cause 
you don't know Japanese"
He'll be like that to us
And then I'll be like..
"Isn't that obvious??"
So yeah I don't know what to say because I 
don't know how to defend myself from that
So yeah I don't know what to say because I 
don't know how to defend myself from that
(To eat Japanese)
We have different teachers per PE subject
And sometimes I don't go to school when it's his day
I felt bullied by that teacher
Thankfully he's not my teacher anymore, because if he is..
No I'm kidding
So far, I haven't had very bad experiences in school
Actually, that was my dilemma before I entered school
Like "Oh shit. I'll get bullied here for sure"
I kept thinking I'll get bullied for being a foreigner
Those expectations didn't happen to me
And I'm thankful for that
We only have good vibes in school
"Hi Kenzo! How much is your tuition fee per school year?"
￥120,000 if I'm not mistaken
That's ￥10,000 per month
"Did you join some club activities now or even before?"
In my first year, I joined volleyball club but only for two weeks
I don't vibe with the senpais (upperclassmen) 
and they kinda bullied me that time
Then they found out that I have a YouTube channel 
then they posted some comments like
"Hey buy a camera. Buy a mic because 
yours are useless" something like that
I personally don't know them but they treat me like that
Feeling close lol just kidding
So I quit volleyball, also because there 
weren't other Filipinos and it was boring
So I joined dance club after
for about 5 months then I quit again
 because they have weird rules
for about 5 months then I quit again
 because they have weird rules
(yuck quitter)
like you have to bow to your senpais every time you meet them
like you bow three times and then greet them
that was exhausting
"What's the difference between Japanese high schoolers' vibes
 and Filipino high schoolers' vibes?"
Okay this is what I really wanna answer
There's are big cultural differences between 
high school life in the Philippines and in Japan
In the Philippines, we are usually, normally noisy and loud
In Japan, the students are very quiet
They would usually talk after classes or during recess
but during classes, they are very quiet
and that was a culture shock for me
Then, during Valentines day, the guys normally
 give flowers or chocolates to the girls
But here, it's the girls that would give the flowers or chocolates
Then they have what they call a "White Day"
A few days after Feb. 14, it's the guys' turn
 to give presents to the girls
In the Philippines, the guys and girls are usually friends with 
each other if the school is a co-ed system
There are friend groups with boys and girls
But here, they are very divided by sexes
Like if you're a girl, you'd only hang around
 with girls, and the same goes with guys
And you'd only talk to each other when it is needed in class
And it's weird for them if you're a guy hanging out with a girl
I don't know why but it's kinda weird for them
But for us foreign students, we don't mind it
because that's not in our culture or the 
 environment we grew up in
So its pretty normal for us, as you can see in my other vlogs
During first year, I was friendly to both boys and girls
And I'm not shy to talk to the girls
But in second year, we had a different set of classmates, 
so it was kinda awkward again to talk to the girls
So I'm only closest to the guys in my class
It's just nostalgic when you have both 
boys and girls in your friend group
"Are there a lot of bullies in high school?"
No, there aren't any bullies
but there are outcasts, the ones who do not talk at all
you'll just find out that they're not sociable
like anti-socials
But bullies, there are none
I guess between friends, you can joke around
but not necessarily bullying
Since you're close friends with them
You can like jokingly hit them
Nope, nothing like that
But there are misunderstandings I guess
*redacted*
There's this person who is very talkative in class
There are times when this person says something
 about my life, to the whole class or the teacher
Things I'm not comfortable talking about
Then one time I was absent because I was sick
And I posted something in my Instagram story
Then this person reported me to the teacher
 for being on Instagram while being sick
So I was like
What's wrong with that?
I was frustrated because this person always does that
But at that time I didn't exactly know
 who told the teacher about it
So I made a story to Instagram saying..
"So someone's keeping an eye on me"
Like there's a snitch..
I posted that and then took it down after 15 minutes
And then this person messaged me a few minutes later
to apologize to me
Like "Hey, I'm sorry, that was my fault"
I was glad though that this person owned up to their mistake
This person said they wouldn't do it again and was very sorry
They'd be careful next time. That's a good thing
But a big fight in school? I don't think there were any
I just wanted to share that
They don't like the girls to wear makeup
But the girls still do wear some makeup
And also when it comes to skirts
The girls would tend to raise their skirts a
 bit (after school) so it would look shorter
But their skirts should really be on the knee level
The school is also strict when it comes to sweaters
Bright colors like red, pink, etc. are not allowed
It has to be brown, gray, dark blue, etc.
And they have to be plain, without designs
It's hard to fit in
There are times when I can't keep up
But I did not put pressure on myself to fit in
because I guess I understood  that I wouldn't fit in
They see us foreign students differently 
now, but I don't mean this in a bad way
Of course there are times that they would treat us differently
And I sure wouldn't want to add any 
more negative impression on us
I just go with the flow
I don't really wanna force myself if they actually don't like me
jk I'm a clown, I'd still chase after them 🤡
It's getting dark out, so I guess that's it for this video
I hope I answered your questions
If you have more questions about my school, 
please comment down below
Are you planning to study high school in Japan?
Don't bother lol jk
Just to be honest, it really is not easy
But I feel like the best thing about school are my friends
And if you haven't subscribed to my channel yet, 
please subscribe now
I'm very grateful for the support that you give me
In any and every way, I never expected for us to grow like this
But here we are, so lets continue on
I still have a lot of school vlogs to post, as well as covers
So stay tuned
