Good moning everybody and welcome to our first full day in Cebu!
Before starting this video, a little disclaimer:
In the Philippines you are not allowed to
hunt nor to kill crocodiles, in the most the
world you can, here not.
So if you encounter them, please, run because
if they are so mean to their own species,
imagine what they can do to you.
But for real, guys, last year a person died
every other day because of crocodiles attacks.
Be safe.
Today we are going to the Taoist Temple.
"Fa caldo"
It's raining a bit and we are not allowed
to film anything.
There is even the police for tourists.
So guys we are not allowed top do anything
in this temple, no pictures, no photos, no
videos...
There are just these little dragons.
It's raining and there are like 30 degrees,
it's incredible.
Guys to me this temple looks like a playground
for kids.
What you think, Walter?
I think they wanna make it too exclusive.
But, I mean, c'mon, we can take pictures around.
This place is a bit of a disappointment.
Maybe even more than a bit.
Therefore now we are gonna check out a way
to go to Oslob where we will finally see the
great whale sharks!
Oh my Gosh, I cannot wait!
Oops, I just realized that I was eding the
wrond day, I ate the crocodile in the previous
one.
Hey guys, today we are at Puerto Princesa
airport and we have to kill way too much time,
so we decided to try crocodile meat.
Well, Walter didn't decide that, he opted
for beef.
I don't wanna risk, guys.
He wants to be safe in life.
And I wanna risk it all.
They told us it tastes like chicken, someone
told that it tastes like pork, but should
be good.
So Walter is saying his meat is pretty good.
Do you confirm it?
Yeah.
I can say.
So it's time to try the crocodile.
I actually really like it!
Are you sure you don't wanna try it?
Gosh.
Approved.
"Ãˆ troppo buono, te l'assicuro."
Is he gonna be safe?
C'mon.
What's your opinion?
I don't know.
You know when you try something for the first
time and you are not convinced 100%.
Eatable.
After doing some research on the web, I found
out that in the Philippines they have crocodiles
farms.
Their meat is sold all over the world and
the leather is sold to big fashion brand like
Louis Vuitton.
I think it's important that when you travel
you are open minded to different traditions
and especially the local food.
In Europe we have no problem eating horses,
so please don't give me a hard time for eating
a crocodile.
By the way, they say that it has aphrodisiac
properties, so maybe you wanna give it a try.,
That's it for today.
Thank you for watching, keep reading and believe
in your dreams!

next vlog.
We'll be going to the Kawasan Falls and then
to see the whale sharks!
