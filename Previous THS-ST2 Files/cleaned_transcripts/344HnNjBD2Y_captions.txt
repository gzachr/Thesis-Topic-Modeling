excuse me
 
I don't know but he looks like a Playboy
to me hello and welcome back to living
abroad in this video I'm going to show
you guys if Filipinos are action
friendly now I got this idea because
somebody left a comment in the last
video it's like oh these Street
interviews are scripted or they're
planned out he knows them all those
random things now I don't mind people
talking smack about me but don't talk
bad about the Filipinos or the people on
my Channel that I interviewed you guys
trust me they don't have to be there and
they're all authentic spontaneous
whatever so in this video I'm gonna try
to talk to some random Filipinos and see
if they're actually as friendly as
everybody says here we go oh and if
you're new to the channel hit the
Subscribe button hit that like button
let's get out there the idea is to try
to interact with as many locals as I can
and tell you guys exactly how that's
gonna go I'm gonna cross the street here
from my apartment with IT Park crossing
the street it could be a whole mission
by itself I want to try to see if I can
make it a crosstalk getting hit so be
careful I want to go in not a good
idea let's go further down the trick is
to wait for a car that is turning or go
with a group of people numbers help not
a good time to make moves I'm gonna go
with these guys and see like they want
to cross the road it's a good time to go
it's a good time to go
oh Street Food
I have to do a whole street food video
one day
hello hi hey guys uh Hey see this guy's
already friendly what's your name Andre
Okay I like your tattoos man thanks okay
what do they mean anything is that your
Island I'm from the island North Side what
city or which island I should say I'm from Bantayan
saying what are you doing here working
okay you're a smart man huh
what kind of job do you have bartender
oh so you can mix drinks okay right
there I'm gonna see you there one day
okay you gotta remember me okay Alex I'm

like that how do you cross the road and
people are super friendly what a
friendly do so I might check out that
bar that he's talking about what is all
the smoke look at this here
oh it's a guy already waving hello

go and just a dude is gonna wave at you
randomly before you even get to him
right so uh anyway so across my place is
IT Park over here you could just uh
basically check out some cafes
restaurants and this little area that I
played basketball last time it's a
little uh barangay I know we call this
like a road

follow YouTube yeah yeah for sure I mean
there you go a perfect example of two
people with a simple question of where's
Metro like obviously I know where Metro
is but like uh they don't know that I
just want to interact with them to give
you guys an idea of how friendly
Filipinos are
um yeah so let's continue with this
mission of testing to see if uh
interacting with local Filipinos is
convenient and um dare I say easy
approachable people are so so friendly
as long as you're respectful though you
got to maintain your respect
excuse me do you know where chat time is
yeah there that way okay
fine thank you so much for your time
appreciate it so as you can see even
though she was in a hurry it seemed like
she still helped me out and you have to
read the room as well right so some
people are in a hurry maybe they don't
want to be a camera I asked her
afterwards it was okay to record or at
least upload that video she said it's
fine
um because I don't want to put anybody
on here that I don't have any permission
so let's see if you can find some other
people to just interact with I don't
know what else to ask but to like ask
for locations or directions or just any
reason to talk to people right
I see a dog let's see if the dogs in the
Philippines are just as friendly
