Australian Tourist Visa from Philippines for
Filipino Relatives
We've written many articles about tourist
visa applications from Philippines before,
but this one
is about tourist visas for Filipino relatives
who wish to visit.
I've written about high risk tourist
visa applications before, where I've covered
some of these points, and yes this is the
category
that these visas fall into.
Getting an Australian tourist visa from Philippines
for Filipino relatives
is high-risk, and it's hard work to see them
turn into visa grants.
Australian tourist visa for Filipino relatives
Many Filipinos at some stage wish to bring
their relatives to Australia on tourist visas
from
Philippines.
Some have plans and wishes for them to stay
longer, even permanently, which is
another story.
I hope I've done enough BLOG articles here
to explain that generic "family visas"
do not exist, and that you cannot "petition"
your cousin or sister to Australia simply
because you
have a partner visa.
Permanent Residency or "PR" is not something
you are entitled to offer to
anybody.
But back to tourist visas for Filipino relatives.
Yes, it's natural enough to want to bring
a relative
from Philippines because you miss each other.
And of course you want to give them a treat,
and
to show them what a great life you're now
leading.
Maybe you have babies you want to show
off, as well as a new home and a happy life
with your Australian man.
And yes, we can and do help with these types
of visas.
The issue though is that we really hate
visa refusals, and we hate seeing clients
disappointed.
And I will not kid anyone and say that it's
really easy for Down Under Visa to get a tourist
visa for your relative from Philippines.
It's not
easy for us, and it's not easy for anybody.
Risks?
They're variable, and even in the best case
scenario a positive outcome will never be
as likely as it will be when we have a romantic
Australian Filipina couple who are building
a relationship and want the visa to enhance
their
relationship.
Why do Australian tourist visas from Philippines
get refused?
With all tourist visa applications, the Migration
Regulations require that the visa applicant
has
(a) a genuine reason to visit Australia, and
(b) a strong enough reason/incentive to return
to
Philippines at the end of the stay.
If they are not convinced of both of these,
they will refuse the
tourist visa application.
And how do you convince them of this?
Knowledge and experience!
Why are Australian tourist visa applications
from Philippines for Australian Filipina couples
generally more successful?
Because when they can see a couple are building
a relationship
together and want her to visit to meet mum
and dad, the friends, and to see how he lives
with a
view to a future marriage and partner visa,
then they are far less likely to do the wrong
thing!
Why would somebody's fiancï¿½e from Philippines
want to wreck everything and run off so she
can pick fruit illegally in Mildura?
Not likely!
See?
Genuine reason to visit?
TICK!
Incentive to return at the end?
TICK!
Consider 27 year old sister wanting to visit
her sister who just had her visa granted.
The sister
just finished a stint as an OFW in Dubai when
her contract finished.
No job.
No house.
No kids,
or maybe 5 year old daughter who lived with
grandma in Philippines while she was working
in
Dubai so child is used to being away from
mum.
The Department have to make a decision
whether the visa applicant is actually going
there for a holiday, and whether at the end
they'll be
happy to hop back on the plane and to go back
to whatever life they came from.
Or will
they.....most likely with the assistance of
the Australian relatives....try to overstay
in Australia
and breach tourist visa conditions?
Are they likely to become an Unlawful Non
Citizen (illegal)
and become a burden to the taxpayer to locate
and remove from Australia?
And for how many
years could they get away with earning tax-free
money in Australia and sending it back to
the
family in the Philippines?

family
Right now you may be saying that this would
never happen with Maribel's sister Marivic.
So
why can't we just assure them that she's a
nice young lady and give her our word she'll
be back
on the plane home within 3 months?
Because Filipinos love their families, and
there are many
who will do anything at all to help them out.
Life turned out very well for them, and they
have a
great life with you in Australia.
Many feel guilty that they can't share their
good fortune with
their family members.
And some may have parents and aunties pushing
them to do something to
help out their sister.
The point is that whilst you may well have
the best intentions yourselves, not everyone
does.
And laws and rules are put in place not based
on what the good people do, but on what the
naughty people do to prevent it happening
more often.
And trust me, there are plenty of naughty
people who break the rules every day.
I get emails from clients who I've got partner
visas for.
They ask if I can get a work visa for their
relative.
And when I tell them that if the relative
has no
skills or a profession they have no hope,
they then ask me about a tourist visa for
them.
What
does that tell you?
Well, it tells me that they don't intend the
relative to return.
So how do you get that guaranteed successful
tourist visa from Philippines for Filipino
relatives?
Can Down Under Visa pull the right levers
and press the right buttons to make it happen?
The
answer is that the more stable the visa applicant
and the stronger the reason for them to visit,
the
better the case.
48 year old mum visiting new grandchild is
much stronger than 23 year old
cousin wanting a holiday since she graduated
college.
34 year old sister wanting a 1 month stay
to be matron-of-honour at your wedding before
returning to her job as an accountant and
her
husband and 3 kids is a better chance than
26 year old unemployed single brother who
wants a 1
year visa to experience the beautiful scenery.
Always a risk of refusal, but sometimes more
or
less so.
Rest assured we will tell you honestly.
