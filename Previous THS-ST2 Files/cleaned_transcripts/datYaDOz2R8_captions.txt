all right my monthly average costs here in the 
Philippines I've spent the past four months  
traveling and living here in the Philippines I've 
been all around the Philippines and today I will  
show you or explain you my monthly average cost 
I'm doing it in four different categories the  
first category will be hotel or accommodations 
then food and drinks transportations and the  
final category will be other costs and yeah I'm 
going to give you the monthly average cost of all  
these categories and then in the end I'm going to 
summarize it to a total amount of monthly average  
costs any of course the cost of living variety 
extremely depending on where you are located in  
the Philippines of course living in Metro Manila 
will be more expensive than living in some rural  
areas or smaller cities but yeah I've been all 
around the Philippines I've spent time here  
in Metro Manila I've been to some islands like 
Boracay or Siargao, I've been to other cities like  
Davao Cebu Iloilo so I think my monthly average 
costs are a good average from the Philippines in  
general and not only about one place any little 
disclaimer before we start with the numbers I  
am not about traveler I'm not trying to travel 
the cheapest way possible so you can definitely  
travel and live here cheaper but yeah I don't try 
to do that but I'm also trying to limit my costs  
I'm not spending money all around so I'm trying to 
limit myself so I think it's a good middle way so  
I got all the numbers here on the sheet in front 
of me let's start with hotels on average I spent  
1074 Euros on hotels here in the Philippines and 
yeah I have my numbers here in Europe but there  
will always be a conversions down below here so on 
average that is 36 Euros a day for hotels and yeah  
I showed many of the hotels where I stayed 
all over the Philippines in my videos it's  
usually pretty decent hotels I would say I'm not 
staying in like super luxurious five-star hotels  
but always a good average good reviewed hotels 
sometimes even with breakfast included often  
a pool as well good locations normally City 
centers where I like to stay and yeah foreign  
average of 36 Euro a day I was able to get pretty 
good and decent accommodations all over the  
Philippines and then the next category food and 
drinks and yeah before I will tell you my number  
um I like to eat a lot of International Foods if 
you would only eat Filipino food every day local  
food then this number can be much slower but I 
also like to eat a lot of Chinese food Japanese  
food at least once or twice a week I'm also 
eating Western food and all these international  
foods are of course more expensive so on average 
I'm spending 493 Euro a month on food and drinks  
and that is on average around 16 euro per day 
and also I am ordering food quite often because  
sometimes I'm traveling all day and when I arrive 
at the accommodation in the evening I don't really  
want to go out again so I order food or when I'm 
sitting here all day working and then sometimes  
in between the work I'm just ordering food so if 
you would actually go out every day and eat a lot  
of local food this number can be way way lower but 
yeah for me on average 16 euros a day on food and  
drinks all right and before we come to the next 
category let me quickly tell you about the travel  
Gadget that I have been using for the past two 
months now and that I absolutely love I started  
to use a sleeping mask I'm using the sleeping mask 
literally every night it's from a company called  
Manta sleep and they are also sponsoring today's 
video and here with the help of this sleeping mask  
I can really fall asleep easier at night and 
I also have a deeper sleep so my Sleep Quality  
gets better let me explain you why because this 
sleeping mask totally blocks out all the the light  
that is coming in sometimes you're staying in a 
place and the curtains are not totally blocking  
all the lights so the sleeping mask totally blocks 
out all the light that is coming in together with  
some earplugs which were included with the mask 
you can totally block out the noise block out the  
light and that really helps to fall asleep easier 
and also to have a deeper and better sleep the  
mask is very easy and convenient to wear there 
is absolutely no pressure on the eyes and after  
a few nights I started to not even notice wearing 
the mask anymore any Amanda sleep offers several  
different types of sleeping masks you can check it 
out all on their website I will leave a link down  
below and if you use the code can at the checkout 
you can get 10 off and they also have a 60-day  
money-back guarantee so you can test out the mask 
without any risk if you don't like it send it back  
and you will get a refund check out the link 
down below thanks to mantisly for sponsoring  
this video and now let's continue with the next 
category Alright and then transportation and that  
of course also depends a lot on do you just stay 
in one place or do you travel a lot so of course  
I've been traveling a lot so my number includes 
for example plane tickets a lot of Taxi rides  
in different cities or renting a motorbike you saw 
me renting motorbikes for example in shiagao or on  
Cebu Island where I did a trip all around Cebu 
Island so on average per month I'm spending in  
278 Euro on transportation and that is on average 
around 9 euro per day and yeah this also includes  
for example I took quite a lot of flights in the 
past months here in the Philippines and many of  
these flights we are booked quite spontaneous 
maybe like just one or two days in advance I  
remember one time when I flew to Davao maybe you 
remember the video I just booked the flight in  
the morning and flew a few hours later and yeah 
sometimes these spontaneous trips cost a little  
bit more instead of booking weeks in advance so 
just to keep that in mind some of my costs were  
really spontaneous so I think if you just stay 
in one area you want to live here you will not  
take planes so often you will not take buses or 
train rides maybe taxi rides depending on where  
you stay and where you want to go so this number 
of course can also be lower but if you want to  
travel around the Philippines that is what you can 
expect and then the final category other costs and  
that includes for example getting haircuts doing 
laundry topping up my phone buying contact lenses  
or also doing some tourist activities joining tour 
groups spending money on tourist boat rides stuff  
like that so all of this I just named other cars 
and on average I spent 95 Euro a month on this  
which is about 3 euro per day only so and that 
brings the final costs all categories summarized  
or sum up together to 1941 Euro or 2059 US dollar 
113 875 pesos or nine thousand one hundred thirty  
one Malaysian Ringgit and you have this amount of 
money I was able to live a really good lifestyle  
here in the Philippines eating good food staying 
in decent accommodations traveling around Whenever  
Wherever I wanted to so you can definitely 
travel cheaper here but if you plan around 2  
000 US dollar a month you can live a good life 
here you can have a great traveling lifestyle  
here and let me know in the comment section 
if you would have expected this number to be  
higher or lower I'm curious to know any of you 
are curious to see my current accommodation here  
in one of the richest areas in Manila the BGC 
area I recently did a full tour showing all the  
apartments showing all the facilities if you're 
curious to see that check out the previous video  
right here stay healthy stay positive and 
then see you on the next episode ciao guys
