Konnichiwat's up Salompas
Today is one of the most important day in whole my life
which is Graduation Day
Today is our Graduation Day
just a reminder guys
this will be the last "School life in Japan" vlog
I couldn't believe time flies so fast
I should've started vlogging before
well i'm not regretting it
but just a little
so today is our graduation day
and it's sad because our parents couldn't attend
and I don't know how will I vlog during the ceremony
I'll just try to vlog inside secretly
I think they will allow me because I'll be graduating anyway
Let's go to the school
so I just arrived in school
and I don't know who's already in classroom
are they complete already?
we were classmates for 2 years
but we've been friends for 3 years
he didn't do anything but to wear an "airpards"
AIRPARDS(bro)
I'll be calling you "Airpards" now
There isn't Filipino yet
only Jaron
We'll just go outside to get war      up
What time did you sleep last night?
10pm
I slept at 4am
by the time we enter Tagara
we took took a picture in front of the gate
and we will remake it later
so it will be memorable
he's crying already
We're classmates for 3 years!
I know right
but we will end up in tears
take a video later
my make up will get erased
me too
you too??
*realizes*
no no no
What can you say?
we're about enter the gymnasium
and our high school life is about to end
I entered high school, single
I graduated high school, single.
All I can say is,
I entered high school, virgin
I graduated high school, -------
is this really a graduation ceremony?
no, it's just a practice
I couldn't help it I cried all of a sudden
he cried
no i didn't
so our certificates will be distributing now
and now they're distributing our ID picture during the 2nd years
and the 3rd years
nothing has changed
oh really
only my pimples changed
you were slim
i know right
we're heading to the gate and this is the end
time flies so fast

and I noticed that i'm about to reach 500k!
I think that will be the graduation gifts from you guys
Thank you so much yall
without yall i wouldn't be at this point right now
I will just finish here
I will FINISH here the School life in Japan

so this is the end of School Life in Japan
First of all, I would like to thank my family
especially to my mother
Ma, thank you for the sacrifices and hard works you've done for me
I don't how to thank you
the word "Thank you" is not enough to thank you
but I will make sure that all your sacrifices and your hard works you've done for me will be worth it
Thank you my classmates and friends
because we've been together in our own journey
it was a big help knowing you all
during the times of our fun, happiness, and sadness
I promise, they will not be forgotten
It's hard to accept that we will no longer be together
but let us continue our own journey in our life
