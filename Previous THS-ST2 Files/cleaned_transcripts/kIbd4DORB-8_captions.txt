hi everyone on today's video i'm going to be 
reacting to something that you guys asked me  
a lot to react to it and this is going to be 
eight days in the philippines i cannot wait  
to see this video because all the other videos 
that i saw about the philippines or the food  
of the places i was amazed so yeah i cannot 
wait to watch it before we get into the video  
please subscribe to this channel if you are 
not subscribed yet because there's a lot more  
new reactions coming and you don't want to 
miss them so now let's go into the video
so i'm traveling today to this country called  
the philippines and the country's tagline is it's 
more fun in the taxi today philippines fun go in  
the plane fun leaving the plane is even more 
fun getting your local sim card is finally fun
welcome to the philippines check in at your hotel
wow welcome to the philippines yeah traffic jams 
are also more fun in the philippines if you're not  
in the car it's so fun in the philippines that if 
you go and ask random people smile smile they will
i want to see if i can have food water 
shelter for the whole day for zero point zero  
here in manila i gave up my valuables my 
drone and my entire wallet and checked out  
of the hotel to hit the streets it's a bad idea 
i cannot take buses or taxis i cannot eat out  
but what i can do is rely on people's generosity 
for water i say i'm thirsty thank you thank you
the people is very thirsty much better to 
eat for food i say i lost my wallet and  
leave you ran after me yes why i'm 
happy oh i'm just sharing my business
unbelievable but for shelter this is a bit hard 
i say i'm stranding i ask one two three four  
five six seven people and then i meet this guy 
what happened to you i mean it's a long story  
he takes me in buys me food offers me his home 
gives me his bed and doesn't even want to be  
filmed there is still good in this world 
i don't think that could happen here money  
i don't like spending it that's why i like the 
philippines it's very cheap a full day tour at  
this island will cost you 20 bucks and maybe 
twenty five dollars for this one a haircut for  
seventeen dollars in hong kong here you can 
get it for one dollar and uber for one hour  
will cost you three dollars welcome a romantic 
date number two will set you back fifteen dollars  
now you're not gonna go on a date island hot and 
get a haircut every single day but what i think  
you might like to do is drink it's so cheap in 
the philippines that this bottle of rum costs  
one dollar and ten cents for that price i can buy 
40 bottles to get the whole village drunk for the  
price of two cocktails in new york city enjoy yeah 
i mean wow i don't drink alcohol so i don't know
but watching it from your phone you will get bored 
after five seconds so let me tell you what makes  
this place incredible above water it's heaven on 
earth even when there is no sun but it's not just  
what's above the water and on the water that's 
beautiful it's also what's hiding underneath  
you have the gazillion small fish that love you 
and the gigantic fish that does not give a damn  
there is a japanese shipwreck 
hiding right under your feet
and if salt water isn't really your 
style there's always a lake hiding
wow that's one minute see you tomorrow  
if there's one energy it's the volcano 
she's standing in a perfect closet  
at 2 463 meters high which is 65 percent of her 
sister mount fuji in japan and three times that  
of porsche khalifa in dubai but it's not her 
appearance and height that make her so majestic  
it's her personality mayon is shy she is so 
shy she hides behind the clouds all the time  
in fact some say her husband are the clowns 
and when you finally see her she's beautiful  
that's insane she is angry that tip of hers every 
three to five years that is deadly angry wow  
that's just scary first of all 
the most perfect human being  
nature has to offer that's me on that's one 
minute see you tomorrow but it's gorgeous  
for the past five days i've only stayed 
in the richest parts of the philippines  
and so it's easy for me to believe that 
all of the philippines looks like this  
but it's not only one cab ride away from 
here you arrive here at the trash mountain  
where people live in such extreme poverty that 
the air is unpleasant to smell but this isn't just  
this area 25 percent of the philippines live under 
the poverty line it's incredible that under the  
same city roof you can lunch like this and dinner 
like this green stuff coming from the ground  
means it's beautiful nature in this case 
it means there's so much trash piled on top  
of each other that it formed a mountain where 
actual people live and plants started to grow  
the country's tagline is it's 
more fun in the philippines  
but i think a more appropriate one is it's 
more fun in 75 percent of the philippines  
i said it before and i'm gonna say it again 
the philippines is cheap which means you don't  
need many dollars to come here and see this 
piece of beauty but it also means you don't  
need many dollars to help those that need 
help it's so cheap in here that we can buy  
this burger with me and all for 20 cents wow 20 
cents and for that price you can buy a thousand  
of these burgers without breaking the bank and 
in a place where people are so poor the trash  
forms an actual mountain you can form an actual 
mountain of food for the price of one average  
hotel stay in new york city and with that 
you can feed up to a thousand people wow
yes cheap prices mean better 
tourism but it also means  
it's not that hard or expensive to 
help those in need that's one minute
yes hi it's my last day in the islands of the 
philippines i'm sad but here is everything that  
i like about this country it's a country with more 
than 7 000 islands which means this and this and  
this exists here this volcano and this volcano 
also exists the prices they are so cheap you can  
get a whole village drunk or another poor village 
bed without breaking the bank but reality is in  
some parts poverty is so extreme people live 
on top of a trash mountain or at a graveyard  
with a dead but you can google all the above 
what you cannot google however are the people  
they will be generous they will feed you 
and they will host you without knowing you  
they will build good startups and they will 
probably like crazy but best of all they will  
be your friends real friends the country's 
tagline is it's more fun in the philippines  
but i don't like them in better term there's 
more love in the philippines that's one minute
thank you
i don't know why i'm getting so emotional i didn't 
expect to cry in this video i think it's just  
how good people is over there and it's not just 
because of what i saw in this video okay relax
it's not just because what i what i saw in this 
video is also because what i i can feel from you  
guys like i have so many subscribers from from 
the philippines and i mentioned it before and i  
mentioned it again i never felt so loved 
in this platform in youtube doing videos
like when i started to meet you guys but this 
video just showed me that yeah you guys are  
so amazing it's like going 
to a capital a capital and  
have people to shelter you to 
feed you to help you it's not easy  
in a capital uh usually like that around the 
world if you go like to a more like on the  
countryside a village or a smaller city 
people is usually nicer in the capitals  
people usually it's have like a busier 
lifestyle and they are not as friendly  
at least that is my experience in in spain where 
i used to live in madrid in the capital and  
people was i don't want to say everyone 
wasn't friendly because they weren't but  
if people was more rude that when i was living in 
other parts of spain and they are more helpful and  
wanting to help and everything i mean same here 
in the uk i live in in the capital in london  
and it's not the same like when i visit other 
cities like yeah so the fact that people  
in the capital is like that i cannot imagine 
then how is going to be people in the in the  
in smaller cities where usually they are more even 
more friendly but it's crazy that they just help  
you like that oh my god and the fact that compared 
to other countries the food is so cheap it makes  
easy to help like 20 cents come everyone can spare
some money to help so i'm going to look 
for um like a charity or something in  
the philippines and all the earnings with this 
video are going to go for that so you will see  
here to help if you want but also the my personal 
earnings of this video will go to that charity  
as well because i really want to help it's 
just a small thing that i can do but i i  
just want to say thank you guys because as i said 
i've been in youtube for more than 10 years not on  
this channel because this channel is quite new but 
on my spanish channel but i never felt so loved  
and so supported like with you guys so 
i just wanted to give something back  
god i i wasn't expecting to cry on this video 
goodness it's just the people is amazing and  
i've seen it in other videos but this this is 
just another proof how amazing you guys are
you have such a lovely energy and
yeah you're amazing guys 
even during these tough times  
you don't lose the smile and that is 
not that is not easy sometimes oh god  
okay i think i'm going to cut this video because 
i'm going to keep crying and i don't want that
