And we are here!
We are going canyoneering today. Oh, oh! I don't know? Are you sure about that?
I'm kinda scared
You'll be jumping off some high cliffs. I just almost died yesterday. I don't know
Well, you got a life vest on and your water shoes and you got a helmet too. Let's go!
Alright, are you ready?
Definitely not ready. Alright
I've no choice, I gotta do it
We're at the start of the Badian canyoneering we've got seven jumps going up to 50 feet
And Kuya Ferdie is gonna keep us safe
Hello!
Hopefully, hahaha my life depends on this the vest, on this helmet, and on these guns. Oh please
All right, let's do it canyoneering
About halfway through our excursion out of nowhere
There are these barbecue vendors selling everything from pork chicken hotdogs bananas even had rice. I don't know how they got down there
Well, make sure to bring cash with you because all this jumping will make you hungry
We booked this excursion through Island Trek Tours and it costs about two thousand seven hundred pesos per person
it included pickup and drop off to our hotel an amazing guide and of course the
unbelievably blue and beautiful waters of the Kawasan falls
Whoa, we survived
We made it alive!
Zero casualties. Yes, there is a casualty. Oh who?
My contact lens. Oh! In my left eye after the last jump that I did
It fell right off some of those jumps were frickin high pretty high
The last jump was like 40 feet high. Was it 40 feet or 50? It was 40
They used to have a 50-foot jump until somebody got paralyzed from jumping and it was high! Their jump was not
perfect. But over all it was a really good experience really fun. I'm actually very surprised about myself
Like I did not think I was gonna be able to make those jumps and I'm not a good swimmer guys
So that was like for me that was a huge risk
