today we are going to Chinatown yay we
are going there to eat delicious Chinese
food
right now super delicious
but you know it's time to try the drink
how we go there
we take the subway
as it is my first time really excited to
see how it is and it takes a while one
hour actually it's just show that Manila
city is really really big and yeah
really excited for this day yeah meet
you later
foreign
got off of MRT and now we have to take
the LRT so I think it's true system
different in Manila Metro was really
clean and went fast it is convenient the
point A to point B it takes us from BCG
to Taft Avenue like 10 minutes yeah 10
minutes and cost around 60 pesos we
could even bought a single Journey
tickets yeah and this is really nice we
don't need to buy a car to load some
Journey yeah
but really easy for us it was kind of
funny because we I think it's forbidden
to speak in veramachi yeah I don't know
if it's because of the Kobe situation or
it's like this always but yeah we were
in the Metro and we just talk but not
too loud we were talking like it's
normal no more talking and but another
to uh to be quiet and it's okay for us
but yeah I wonder if it's like this
always or because of the coffee
situation you know it's just like in
Gangnam actually sometimes you can hear
that just refresh talking to let's pray
that you wear something like this and we
are going through uh
expensive
yeah we can now visually see Chinatown
because we are just in front of a gate
over there a beautiful gate yeah a red
but it is the biggest gate actually of
Chinatown in the world also the
Chinatown Manila is the oldest one in
the world too yeah I'm really curious to
see how it is now and see all the food
that we can get yeah the mixture with
the Philippine Cuisine and Chinese
cuisine I can watch to see and try it
yeah
can you read what's on the gate

can just
see the shop and go inside and try the
foods of a drink so I'm really excited
