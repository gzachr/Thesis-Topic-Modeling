won't you hold me
[Music]  
hey guys it's Mike here I'm here with Jay with 
the black Filipino TV and of course if you guys  
are not aware he's got another Channel more 
to life where he does reaction video so you  
guys definitely gotta check that out I'll put 
in the description down below Jay thank you  
so much for coming here man I know it's late 
in the right in the morning there for you so  
but anyways like I I'm just gonna get it if if 
there is like a few things that you can share  
with people about you can you just share that 
right now well me myself a lot of people know  
my story if you don't know me I've actually 
came out to the Philippines seven years ago  
um decided Well not going back to the US and I 
did it I was successful worked online and that's  
a little bit about me I'll let Mike answer ask 
more questions and I'll answer them I'll knock  
them down but that's just living about me 
move on to the Philippines and came to stay  
well you know what how how did you all of 
a sudden say Philippines like you know of  
all I mean did you like flip that you know that 
globe and be like right here or was there like  
a process where you said you know what I think 
I think I want to go to the Philippines because  
number one is you know there's not really a lot 
of content out there until you started producing  
a lot of content and a few other creators I 
think within the past I'll say seven to ten  
years I mean within the past five years there's 
more content out there which helps people but  
how do you choose the Philippines actually well 
actually um man just from dating online really
I didn't even want to come because I didn't 
believe in dating online right so when I  
first started dating my wife online I tried to 
break up with her wow because I'm like you know  
why would I date a woman online like I was one 
of those kind of guys you know some guys like  
I wouldn't even dare go to another country to 
go get a woman right and I was trying to break  
it off with her because I wasn't really I wasn't 
one of those guys oh I want to go dated Filipina  
because modern women are like this I found it 
out after right oh wow this way but I started  
connecting the dots with my wife and I started 
saying it was really really bad back in the years  
I didn't leave yourself I wanted to go get away 
from women there but it's a long story me dating  
online right that's when I knew because or the 
woman I was trying to talk to in the U.S weren't  
responding to me the woman that responding to me 
were from Jamaica Philippines Thailand right so  
it's kind of like passport broke thing just 
came to me because those were women that would  
responded all the women that were in the U.S were 
preoccupied with chasing the guy that's going to  
be the uh televangelist Pastor you know and I've 
seen I didn't really get it but I kind of seen it  
I noticed I said wow that's probably why no woman 
would talk to me the woman that did talk to me  
um had a kid that was playing games about it 
interesting yeah it's like it's like it's that  
whole you know you can even say like maybe you 
didn't see the term yet then it's like the red  
pill reality or red pill awareness that that 
occurs and something that is just it's more  
of a you know organic whereas guys jump into 
in a way where we say the red pill awareness  
is that they hear it from other guys then all 
of a sudden they wake up you know but you yeah  
you live the reality that you discovered the 
difference yourself you know so that's how I  
did cool yeah I seen it it was crazy okay what's 
your question no but so like okay so so from the  
moment that you met you know that you met the 
amazing K right so from that moment that when  
you decided you know what I want to pursue 
this how long did it take you from saying  
you know what I'm gonna move to the Philippines 
I'm going to take I'm gonna you know go ahead and  
um jump this whole thing from that moment 
to arriving in the Philippines how long did  
it take you for that from that moment to arriving 
in the Philippines I actually procrastinated Mike
it took a year man a year 
yeah it took a year because um
I know it may sound crazy man I still wasn't 
sure it was like just to go just to go you know  
pick up and live my whole life somewhere 
else just I just didn't think about it  
I didn't think about it and then you know 
she put the pressure on me which she should  
have because I was talking about for two years 
respect yeah yeah yeah that's what it was man  
okay so like okay so so you you did it but you 
know what a year is still good because the way  
I look at it is like you have to prepare yourself 
you know because I mean um one thing that a lot  
of guys don't look at is sometimes was there any 
backlash or maybe some people that you know family  
our families and friends sometimes hold us back 
not because that they're hating but because they  
kind of love us and they don't want us to you know 
mess up was there any of that kind of friction  
that happened to you where a lot of people are 
like don't do it man don't do this thing you know  
um I got friction from a couple of people um 
but the people that were very important in my  
life supported my move also because the people 
that were important in my life knew how smart I  
was and I spoke to these guys on a regular basis 
right and they said I know if you're gonna go you  
know what you're doing but then I had people like 
my my father who said you wanna know I did full  
broad man because my father is from he's from 
Jamaica Queens and he talks like that man you  
gotta go out there there to get a woman I said 
no Pops I get a woman here we want it easy here  
that's not the thing I said the kind of woman that 
I'm getting is never done the stuff that anyone no  
woman's ever did this kind of stuff for me she was 
doing it online you know I had to make the choice  
awesome what's so actually here's this I mean 
have you been to any other country outside the  
United States before you went to the Philippines 
nope so Philippines was the first one Philippines  
was the first one and when I came here that's 
when I started going everywhere it was crazy  
I came here and I got with her and it was like 
now it's time to travel the world you know now I'm  
gonna go here I'm going to Singapore I'm going to 
Malaysia I'm going to go with her to Thailand I'm  
gonna experience other places and that's when I 
started moving man that's when I started doing it  
yeah it's something and I think that's why you 
know the very positive part of like the passport  
bro movement is like it's getting guys away from 
their comfort zone and then sometimes when you  
make that first travel that first stamp in your 
passport right it kind of like expands your mind  
like oh my God there's more places to be in the 
world other than let's say you know you're from  
New York for example than going to Chicago and 
then going to California that's still within  
the US you know so that's that's amazing man 
now here's the thing did you prepare yourself  
like research things about the Philippines 
before you arrived man I didn't do none of that
shocked that a lot of a lot of guys be honest with 
you watch my videos right because it's like I'm  
one of those kind of guys I can't listen to what 
someone else tells me about a place right I have  
to go see it for myself yeah and you probably like 
that too right but a lot of guys they watch us and  
I get it like okay you want to be sure you want 
to be absolutely sure but it's like you don't  
know until you're doing it man yeah it's that Mike 
Tyson you know talk where you don't you know until  
you get in the ring get punch in the face you know 
you don't you don't know you know so it's like  
exactly so I I get it uh yeah I mean I I feel the 
same exact way like people are watching my videos  
what's going on here I don't I don't get this you 
know but I mean man like I didn't watch all these  
guys and these guys that were doing it before 
me there was guys like rikay you know guys that  
you know you pay how much for those guys a couple 
other guys they're not really around anymore but  
um I didn't watch them I found out about them 
when I got to the Philippines I started making  
videos that's when I found out who they were wow 
so I mean like so if that's the case since you  
just went all in uh what were like if you're like 
five things that shocked you the moment you landed  
because because what guys don't understand is when 
you land in the like I told guys sometimes let in  
the Philippines on a night trip like a nightmare 
because it's like it's this like bombardment of  
like visual um smell you know auditory noise 
sometimes if you're not if you're not good at  
there's like that big hit that happens and you're 
looking around you're just like what's going  
on here like what were the things that like the 
moment you let did you land in the morning time or  
nighttime I landed at around 12 1 in the morning 
okay so you got the night you got the night
and it smelled like poop mixed with piss mixed 
with a whole bunch of other smells right okay I  
said I said where in the hell am I did I land in 
right I was like this the Philippines is like this  
and when I got out in the airport you know 
the airport wasn't quite done up yet like  
how it is now it's a lot better now right 
now it's a lot better but it was decent  
um I got out into the town right you know you 
got the airport you may go through you go through  
areas that are decent right so areas were decent 
and then I say I want to get something to eat okay  
where did we go we went to Jollibee right when 
I first came off the plane I went to Jollibee  
I got chicken from Jollibee didn't know 
yeah I got chicken from Jollibee so that's  
when I first tasted Jollibee right 
so if you got some chicken went home
yeah right so this will happen 
so I I was staying in passing  
and I'm right around the corner from the 
market if anyone's been the pasig market  
back in the day should be one of the most 
sturdiest places in the Philippines right  
and so not only that I didn't go to 
the market but over there in the area  
the building looked like projects sorry it wasn't 
like a project but like it wasn't painted anything  
so it's a lot better now and I was over there and 
I hear people screaming in the morning and then  
I'm like it's noisy in New York and I'm sitting 
there like where am I okay what did I give myself  
my nervous I I didn't look I didn't look up the 
Philippines not to hear any stories yet so I'm  
going to a head first like and I'm sitting there 
like what did I do I'm doubting myself man uh-huh  
and that and that's expected from a guy that 
just comes and sees this for the first time  
you know I'm seeing and I wasn't used to it and 
it was the biggest shock I ever had in my life  
and I loved it not right away okay so okay but you 
loved it though you loved it yeah a week later I  
started to love it okay I said okay I'm kind of 
happy this happened it was a shock to my system  
that I've never had before man it was like this 
could be this can go all go bad like I don't know  
what's gonna happen I'm on defense meeting people 
you know naturally I'm from New York and but I'm  
still calm and cool and people just said that I 
just adapted it to people that adapted to me and  
you know how the Philippines is already and so the 
areas I was in the people were they were a little  
Hood it was in passing they were little hood 
and I was I was right at home I could say that  
I mean and you said a particular word which 
is great like adapt being able to adapt right  
um I think that's that's completely correct if you 
come to the Philippines you must be able to adapt  
and at the same time as you know some people when 
there's change they don't like it they feel that  
people are changing them but the thing is you come 
to the Philippines that is the whole thing you  
have to adapt to the whole environment that you 
have and I think I I feel sometimes that some guys  
fail in that when with adapting and then that's 
why they have a they have the biggest problems  
like so like just talking about it's like so you 
pick up you're in the Philippines and stuff like  
that like um what were you looking at did you have 
a plan for resources wise because you know you're  
obviously not you're not retired yet so like what 
what was the process did you already think about  
it before you arrived in the Philippines 
or okay perfect yeah actually uh my wife  
convinced me and I'll tell 
you how she did it right  
you know as men I'm like you know I just want 
to make sure I'm sure I just want to make sure  
I'm sure and she told me something in it was 
a reality smack to my face she said how long  
have you been working your current job right 
now on upwork right and then I looked at look  
at the time I'm working I said about a year and 
three months she said so why are you not here
yeah why are you right why am I not there  
someone said oh well I don't have to I don't 
have any money like that well she said when well  
when do you get paid you can pay every Wednesday 
right okay let's get paid as much that she said so  
just uh keep the money you have now I already 
have my money on PayPal right she said you can  
transfer money over here no problem and she laid 
off K is like that right she laid out simple is  
she like a guru in sales or something because she 
just sold you the Philippines you know without it  
that is freaking amazing man no she she called 
how can I say she caught me down it made me  
realize how seamless the transition is right so 
I'm sitting there thinking I'm like she's right
hmm and the reason why I listen to her is because 
I listened to her when she said that was because  
she was helping me with everything meaning I had 
an online business where we were hiring Filipinos  
and we were doing that right online and she 
was doing that while working a teacher job  
so of course I'm gonna listen to her you know 
everything she was saying she said and I said you  
right and that's what made me make the transition 
so do you still have that that online business  
that you were doing yeah yeah I still have it 
yeah yeah I mean I think that's where a lot  
of guys need to understand that you know because 
some guys just have this notion that you know only  
it's only for retirement it's only for retired 
guys or pensioner guys to go to the Philippines
you know you know what they don't realize is 
that most of the people in the Philippines are  
not retirees they're businessmen that 
have call centers that do what I do  
right they come out here and do bpos like a lot 
of people don't realize most of the guys in the  
Philippines are staying in Manila running BPO 
businesses and running other businesses and  
that's who most of the expats are they're not guys 
in Dumaguete you know wasting Life Away drinking  
there are guys out here doing business and I think 
a lot of people need to really I think when people  
see this interview they're gonna go they've and 
you can research it right you can research and  
say we're the most expats they're in Manila I'm 
makate they're in BGC they're in areas like that  
and there are a lot of them are not retired 
to actually have fully functioning businesses  
yeah I completely agree the only thing is 
that you know for a lot of guys all they see  
with you know guys or expats that say that's 
coming to the Philippines are the ones that  
are online the ones that they see at certain 
places Angeles city or Dumaguete like you said  
um and they think that that is the majority of 
the expats or the or the men that's flying to  
the Philippines and I completely agree but most of 
the guys unfortunately won't step themselves into  
a BGC area or or a Makati or those kind of things 
and yeah majority majority of the guys that come  
in the Philippines like and I've seen it myself 
and you've seen it it's not all you old people  
it's a lot of young guys so I mean but until 
people get the reality of that thing so so okay so  
you know let's just jump into the past more 
bro movement just because you know you've  
um you're in debt you're I mean we're in it no 
matter what and stuff like that what do you think  
is because there's a lot of negativity that's put 
in place with the passport bros we're seeing it  
um both coming from women and men unfortunately 
you know I don't know I don't know if that's  
something that you see but I see it like you 
know passport guys are getting it from both sides  
what's your take in the whole community of it and 
and do you see yourself as part of that community  
almost definitely you know um Mike you can't 
fight it it's one of those things like I would  
say before oh I'm not I'm not red pill right and 
then I thought about everything and I said I'm one  
of the most I'm purple pill now of course I said 
I'm one of the most hardcore Repco guys around in  
my life I didn't realize it and then you could 
say I'm not a passport bro then what am I doing  
I'm the reason why guys are leaving the country I 
just happen to be doing it I made myself an expat  
but at the end of the day I'm still a passport 
bro you know I jumped up and relocated myself and  
I did it because relationships weren't working 
for me back in the west and that's true right  
I did it Okay the reason why I dated her is 
because things didn't work on my my past lady  
right that's why I was looking for a woman online 
and the reason I was looking forward went online  
was because I didn't want to date women in the 
street because I didn't want to just keep banging  
random woman like I'm like an older yeah and I 
I started giving my life to God and it was like  
I can easily do that like I didn't want to just 
do that you know and so I said where am I going  
to find women that really believes in what I 
believe so I went to sites looking for that  
yeah I mean and that's the thing also it's like 
you know like like you said like for me passport  
Pro meaning that if you have a passport and you're 
willing to go to another country whether to live  
there or to explore other countries um I think 
that that's that's part of the movement I think  
that just like in the red pill movement there's 
different measures or you make Tao or are you  
inside because incel is right it's the red belt 
it's all part of that so it's just about red pill  
awareness some guys puts negativity and now we 
transfer to a passport bro I think it needs to be  
to the part that there's going to be a measurement 
for passport Pros are you the guy who just wants  
to go to other countries to chase tail or you guys 
are you looking to see your girlfriend or are you  
looking to move right there has to be a moment 
and they and unfortunately it's that you can  
even say Feminine energy or toxic feminine energy 
where they will Bunch you up together always just  
because somebody kind of messes up you know so 
it's kind of it's kind of weird that way but you  
know I think it's it's a good thing where a lot of 
guys are starting to to get out there but online  
dating what's your what was your um what 
was your experience in that I mean you know  
I I don't want to get you in trouble I'm just 
saying it's no no no but no okay I'll say it  
in front of my wife man awesome yeah yeah I don't 
actually I don't want to get in trouble with case
what's you know your experience of diving 
into that kind of stuff and like what kind of  
like apps did you use well actually I only used 
one app I use the app the um called the single  
Adventist because I was looking for a Christian 
woman that truly believed in the Bible and  
in order to get on the site you had to 
answer them Bible truths that a lot of  
people don't know and so yeah so that site was 
like hardcore it wasn't like the it wasn't like  
Christian Filipino anything like that right 
you could say you're a Christian to go to  
the site that site it changed now but you 
had to answer like 40 questions okay that  
not just everyone knows right or if they had 
if they answer one question right they'll get  
the next one wrong they just don't know 
got it so that it was like that but then  
you know and also too they had um Bible study plan 
it was a lot of stuff there man it was different  
okay yeah it was Hardcore it was Bible studies 
going on they had um they had Christian channels  
on the site it was it was crazy man and that 
that has since changed because I went and checked  
it out after but that was a site that's where 
the truck would attracted me to that side yeah  
wow so like so that means there's a higher 
chance that you had less like you'll say also  
even scammers trying to chat with you or was there 
still some that gets into the weed sometimes they  
still get in there they still get in there in the 
same Filipino scammers were there too yep always  
gets in there man always they find their way in 
and it happened there wow so they they still get  
in there that's what I'm saying you have to be 
careful like what's like um look you know luckily  
for you you never had to experience like because 
you know you found K but you got you got there  
you already had an established woman waiting 
for you and stuff like that but like you know  
from your experiences talking to a lot of guys 
what are what are like the top five like scams  
that they always get involved in like from your 
experience with your viewers that they report well
I think the most things they get involved in is 
not feeling like it's a scam right woman woman  
playing a long game with them and that right there 
is just almost unavoidable you know what makes you  
feel like and Philippines can do it they're 
one of the best at it in the world and that's  
what's crazy yeah and they have you feel like 
you're that you're everything to them and then  
Break Your Heart Right and I've seen guys man they 
come with my videos to complained about the same  
thing I've known these guys for years and like 
are you complaining about the same story every  
time I see you coming and oh but you have a day to 
do you wrong and that break your heart it's like  
and I don't say anything I I can't like 
hey just be quiet stop complaining because  
that's what Philippines can do right but at 
the same time they love heart like that too  
but it's all about who you pick right and one of 
my tests that I did actually before I did a k i  
met a Filipina before her and I brought up money 
and my test was if she said anything about money I  
didn't date her at all right so that's a red flag 
for you it was right away I bought it up purposely  
and I bought it up and then she bit on it and I 
stopped talking to her another girl before kid  
got it I wasn't hearing it stop 
talking to her I bought up money with k  
I don't want to talk about money I said oh what's 
this and because she was scammed she was almost  
scammed by an African guy oh wow that's the flip 
side of it the African guys do scams on Filipinas  
I I that's something that doesn't get talked a lot 
in our community how there are a lot of Filipinos  
who've been scammed they're like there's a package 
scam they think that there's something's coming  
in and all that stuff so yeah it's okay so like 
okay so you have you have that what else uh okay  
actually I'll segue here um let's say because we I 
also hear this and for me wise I have a different  
perspective on it um guy and girl because you see 
that actually you see this in Rapid 24 a lot right  
so guys with a girl and then all of a sudden you 
know they break off you know and then he feels  
that she's and he'll start saying that she scammed 
them like do you think it's a scam if a guy is is  
in a relationship with a woman giving her all 
this stuff willfully and then they break up  
and then he starts calling her a scammer is that a 
scammer is that like a the long game like you say  
as well that's the long game and you did it to 
himself it happens with a lot of guys right and  
I've seen a video of woman in Dominican Republic 
talking about it and she made perfect sense she  
said you know a lot of times guys the reason why 
guys leave they want women to need them right  
and then a woman actually needs you a woman 
in the Philippines sometimes will need your  
woman Dominican Republic or somewhere else may 
actually need you and then a guy would complain  
that a woman needs them and I said she's so 
right and some guys welcome that some guys  
will have a Filipino or someone from another 
country that they're giving money to welcome  
me because they feel like oh my man and she 
said that you know if you you can't you have  
to take the good with the bad so it's whatever 
you see it whatever your bad is whatever's bad  
to you some guys are fine giving a little bit 
of money some guys are not I wouldn't give an  
over the money right but some guys don't mind 
and I can't bash that guy for doing that right
yeah you just made me actually realize something 
right like you just made me realize something here  
you know the girl the guy wants to feel needed by 
the woman right so he's gonna make sure he keeps  
on giving her the things that she needs but then 
because the guy you know sometimes the guys will  
try to guys will technically date lower lower 
socioeconomic you know but in the Philippines  
it's a wider thing but as the guy keeps on giving 
her what she needs she eventually becomes even  
because she has everything that she needs and 
she no longer needs much no more than he feels  
he feels left actually and that he doesn't like 
that no more and then what happens is and this  
happens a lot especially if the woman is playing 
a long game and she does have somebody at home  
that's why guys have to be careful 
with giving before they come you know  
because they you never know yeah and I think 
that what you did on the test part is like you  
know you test them and then you dump them 
some guys will test them still give them  
money and then you know then he'll be like 
okay then he just has doubts on her now but  
he stays around still but that's the one I 
don't get it's like a lot of guys do that a  
lot of guys do it I have consultation 
with guys and they're doing them like  
and I don't see anything because it's wrong to 
say Oh no you're wrong for doing this right it's  
whatever the guy feels is wrong yeah I'm not going 
to tell you oh you're wrong because you don't feel  
wrong right but then you can't turn around and 
complain with something you know what I'm saying  
yeah when she leaves or when she does or when she 
goes with another guy you put that on yourself  
you created the monster actually yeah yeah wow 
okay yeah it's just the weirdest things and  
okay yeah that's actually I'm just weird I'm just 
actually to be honest I'm processing because I'm  
like you just made me realize that one thing of 
like you know once you get them to a level and  
what's your take like for example for guys 
dating Filipinos like where where are they making  
mistakes on certain things or choosing like and 
I'll I'll make an example because there's there's  
several things that always gets into like this 
argument sometimes in in my in my comment section  
I don't know if you're about yours uh about dating 
Province Filipina or a City Filipina and the next  
thing is dating you know like a lot of guys will 
say you cannot date women who are educated in the  
Philippines um and it's better to date somebody 
who's uneducated and poor like what's your takes  
on those two things well my sort of take because 
I've been living here right and like you can be  
in the city and what you'll see like Let me Give 
an example like you've been a province and a woman  
could be a slower in the profits and painted 
like she's a good woman right and it actually  
happens a lot and guys won't know right they 
think the guys just think oh the promise and  
it's very boring in the province right so if 
you're bored what do people tend to do with it  
when they're bored people tend to yeah do it 
relations right yeah guys won't realize a lot  
of that could happen and you won't know right 
you know what happens a lot in the province  
family members or you know all that stuff happens 
yep and you will never know that you live you went  
in Providence today I'll just give an example 
right I know I know what I know those examples  
yes it happens and there's even situations 
that happen in the province and I know from  
uh case Kay's cousin was a teacher right in the 
province and situations where girls were raped and  
then they were loose after that a lot of these 
things a lot of times these things happen but  
can you find more success in a problem with 
the province girl yes still at the end of the  
day you can still find more success because the 
city is cruel and you have a lot of women in the  
city they're in the city they're drinking more 
they're living they become modern woman right  
get focused on chasing it back that does happen 
but then at the same time you still can find it  
doesn't matter really but will you have more 
success in the province yes I do believe that  
okay I do believe if I would have more success 
in a province should he hang his hat on that  
no if a guy goes to a city and he's a talker 
if he's a guy that doesn't mind we'll start a  
conversation a guy like you a guy like me or 
that won't mind opening his mouth he's gonna  
find things if he knows how to read people 
he's gonna be able to read the read the girl  
you know so really it doesn't matter at 
that point but if a God doesn't know it  
and just hanging us out in a province he shouldn't 
be coming to the Philippines be honest with you  
a lot of guys come out here and get their heart 
broken because they don't understand people  
yeah and they end up and they 
end up with a bar girl yeah and  
you know I mean so okay so you dated with a 
purpose right so um like for me Wise It's like  
I always tell guys if you're gonna come to the 
Philippines to date that's good but don't mix  
it with bar grow fun because then you're gonna get 
confused and you might that's how I feel that guys  
end up falling for bar girls because they come 
here for dating they can't and they can't talk  
they don't they can't find a girl then they go 
to Angela City or you know somewhere in my life
you know I'm a lot that's changing so yeah 
slowly and I so that's why I think that for  
me wise I don't know if you agree with it it's 
like if you're gonna date date but if you come to  
the Philippines and you you want to Rebound with 
the bar scene you're you're never gonna have that  
mindset I don't know I'm all about that mindset 
sometimes and if you mess here with your head  
what's your take on that one oh no I'm all about 
mindset too and um ill if you got it it's gonna  
have fun of the bars have fun but don't let the 
ball girl get you to a point where you put your  
guard down so they can do that they can do that 
and then they tell you you know what happens a  
lot in the Philippines especially with the young 
ones they'll tell you oh no need to wear that  
condom and then you know guy coming especially 
if a guy doesn't really get anything like that  
right he says oh yeah no problem and then that's 
a whole other problem so another situation yeah  
it's like the weirdest things like you know guys 
running away from Western women but they come to  
the Philippines and they find the same thing but 
of lower like this is my assessment guys in the in  
the west let's say you know they're either simping 
pedializing women but that woman will never want  
him unless he's doing something for her right and 
then they don't want these other women as well and  
they still pedalize those women and then they go 
to the Philippines and it's like they pedestalize  
the lower class I'm not talking about poor I'm 
talking about lower class attitude women or we'll  
just say low value women instead of that you know 
it's weird that way for me now okay so you're in  
a city Posse right and all of a sudden you know 
then you have you know what you uh you were one  
time you were in this one condo and I saw this 
condo I was like I think I've been in that condo  
I was like you know but um there was like a lot 
of I like to remember that one because I saw the  
the pool and stuff and I was like man I was like 
you know what there's a lot of flight attendants  
living there I said it's probably it must 
have been my birthday I think so yeah and then  
all of a sudden you're in the province like 
that's that's what happened you know you went  
for you were City then all of a sudden 
Province um what made you decide to move  
and move to the province all of a sudden out 
of the blue was that like uh overnight thing  
oh the covet thing made you move yeah covet um 
it was strict it was over strict in the city in  
in a province you know gyms weren't asking you 
to be vaccinated but long story short I moved  
to the province ended up getting vaccinated 
anyway it was crazy and didn't realized that  
me being in a province I was actually leaving 
opportunities on the table for me and my wife  
it'd be different if he was just coming like some 
guy's just coming here to retire and that's it  
right yeah I'm still a flogger yeah right I'll 
still have other things going on like actually  
I'm I'm a I'm a permanent resident so I can have 
many opportunities at my disposal other guys can  
have because I can work in the Philippines yeah 
right I can run business in the Philippines so  
like I have the same privileges as a guy with an 
srrv Visa so why would I not take advantage of  
that and the city is where it's going to be at and 
everything like so so I completely agree I just  
remember like you were having some work done in 
the in the balcony and stuff like that and I was  
like oh he's really he's moving in they moved in 
for real I was like bam right and then I was like  
cool I got busy then all of a sudden because you 
know I came back to the fields and I got busy and  
all of a sudden you know I'm like I'm sitting down 
in uh ab's Hotel I still remember it like and I'm  
watching a video and you're like wait going back 
to the city I was like I don't get what's going  
on you know but yeah you know about that right 
you know what's funny about that is for that for  
that to get that work done I had a whole like 
porch built right like barred up and everything  
okay how much that cost four it cost me like 
400 bucks it costs 24 000 pesos man wow yeah so  
400 bucks I I was able to borrow up the front 
of my place and that's where I put my washing  
machine right I was able to hang clothes there 
also it kept people from knocking on my door  
because the neighbors the little kid next door 
he would just be sitting on my stoop right and  
I said okay we got to stop that I also want to 
be able to wash my clothes so 24 000 the guy did  
it it was really supposed to be 40 000. I talked 
him down he built the food for 24 and made sense  
ah I see and that's that's what's nice about the 
Philippines the the cost you can you can save a  
lot of money doing things that would cost you 
maybe about 5 000 in the US maybe a little bit  
more plus all the all the different uh licensing 
and things that you need to get you know so that's  
that's what's nice about that now um if if you 
had a safe number like let's say for example you  
speak to somebody you're giving advice what is the 
safe number or the budget that they should have  
monthly to live a comfortable Safe Life in the 
Philippines like what's what's your like this is  
the starting point where I know you're you're 
good it's the depending on on who it is you  
know and what habits you have like I'll be honest 
with you um when I first came to the Philippines  
I drink a lot right okay I smoke a lot and for 
two people my budget was always for two people  
um my budget was still still at about 
2 000 right for two people when I first  
came out here and when I moved to 
the province my budget was at about  
12 to 1300 for two people okay so depending 
if a guy's gonna be in a city now it's gonna  
be a little more so I'll say maybe 2500 at 
the least in the city depending on where  
he's living some guys want to live a certain 
lifestyle um but like where I'm at right now  
my condo is what 300 bucks a month okay is 
it like a one bedroom two bedroom it's like  
one and a half one and a half okay it's one 
and a half and um spacious enough it's in uh  
it's like uh like usually it's like a studio 
but it's the reason why it's not a studio you  
know how they usually have the studios 
built but like the sliding door yeah but  
it's not one of those like where the sliding 
door supposed to be like right here right  
um it's a it's an end unit so it's actually has 
a one bedroom oh nice it has a one bedroom right  
here the bedroom is small but it gives me the uh 
I have the ability now like where I'm at right  
now it's my workspace I'm gonna put a cabinet 
there and I can turn it into a two bedroom if  
I wanted to yeah because you can put the you 
can put the sliding box if you want to exactly  
yeah exactly so I like it I like it and um it's 
spacious enough for me because really with all the  
reason why we need more space is for my clothes 
but all I had to do was buy a big cabinet I got  
a cabinet for for 400 bucks it's very big goes 
almost almost up to the ceiling very wide and I  
can store my clothes so there you go that's 
a good thing man stay safe 2500 2500 2000.  
I'm I'm actually exactly in that point as well 
you know anything above 22.50 for me just for  
bit especially I think guys also mess up they 
they have a budget for themselves but they don't  
budget in the fact that when they meet a woman 
because dating you know yeah you can take her to  
Jollibee I get it yeah you can do certain things 
but it does add up and I think that a lot of guys  
don't pay attention to that sometimes you know 
but yeah around that but you know talking about  
that it's like when you got insurance like you 
got insurance right health insurance and stuff  
like that you know and um so I used to smoke used 
to drink do you still do any of that now no okay  
all right then you're gonna have to help me with 
something how the hell did you quit smoking man
I that that's my demon that's my 
demon man it's my demon that I have  
like you know what it took for me to stop 
man what's up for me to have many strokes  
you're the Tia I should remember that now 
you had a TIA right yeah it took for me  
to smoke a cigarette me walking up the block and 
start limping because my mini stroke activated wow  
welcome to the block I'm smoking I'm like oh 
listen I'm limping I think I'm walking fine and  
I feel like I said I'm nipping and then I come in 
the house my wife is crying and I said I can't do  
this anymore she's crying and the reason why she's 
crying because her father just passed from being  
hard-headed so she's looking at me and her husband 
like I can't lose you man I feel like I'm getting  
emotional right now I'm just talking about it 
like and then when she said it and I I knew I  
knew she went through because I seen him when he 
passed he was there right and so I knew how she  
took it and she cried that day I couldn't do it 
anymore it took something that dramatic for me  
right um figure that out then on myself yeah yeah 
you know what though I thought you had the magic  
pill for it I thought you'd be like well Michael 
wouldn't use change your mindset and have a you  
know but okay you know what you know what kept me 
I'll tell you what kept me off fit exercise man
um I'm a uh what do you call it I'm a uh I have an 
addictive personality right if I do something I'm  
gonna go all in so I'm gonna drink I'll go all in 
when I find smoking cigarettes I'll go all in if  
I'm um planning something I'll go all in right 
and with me I changed one extreme for another  
so I said in order for me to stop smoking for 
good I need to get a tread Bill and what I did was
I every time I got up in the morning I look at 
that treadmill and said okay I gotta do this I  
have to stop doing this so I have to pick up 
this right and I just jumped on the treadmill  
every day and then my wife I had my wife jump on 
it too and then I started going to the gym more I  
had to replace one thing with another and when 
I did that that's when I had a different drive  
right that's when I started one I started wanting 
to focus more on videos and it actually helped me  
because my channel changed around because I was 
making videos like going places like the Makati  
and those videos don't get views right it's 
just facts yeah yeah I get you I understand  
but I still put him out because that's just me 
like a lot of the videos that I don't get that  
doesn't get views are actually the videos that 
I'm very very passionate about that I'm like oh  
I love that like you know let me show you the 
the the hallway over here at Shangri-La Hotel  
and like videotaping and it's gonna get 50 views 
100 views but I'm like eh I'll put that out okay  
Mike you know what I realized what's up YouTube 
channel you have to do the extreme content and  
that content as well but you have to it's 
kind of like you have to kill yourself for  
content right like you do a short video you 
do a video like that you passions like going  
somewhere another video about something serious 
right so you're just hitting and people like  
okay I'll watch it all right yeah get all the 
senses you know exactly and so you're gonna hit  
the people that want to watch that stuff because 
this people gotta say oh Jay uh I like to do these  
videos I don't like to do the other videos but 
I'm like nobody's nobody's watching these videos  
everybody's watching the other videos right like 
the other video I did just got 150 000 views  
[ __ ] the video I did I just went to back y'all 
that got a thousand views wow so what do I do I'm  
thinking like what do I do okay do that video and 
do the other video simultaneously kind of like at  
the same time okay okay got it I got it do you 
release at the same time or do you separate them  
by a few hours Let's jump right about a few hours 
but you know you gotta kind of do it at the same  
time okay because you're giving to this person 
what they want that person what they want also  
um it's gonna give Filipinos what they want 
too because people that watch those views a  
lot are going to be Filipinos sure so of 
course you want foreigners that's more  
money but I still want Filipinos to see my 
content too yeah of course so so you've been  
in the Philippines this long right like what 
are the still the foods that you won't touch  
oh man I won't touch the loot again even 
though I've tried it before you don't you  
know what I used to love bullet and then 
I hated it and then when I was back there  
for three months I loved it again man what's 
what's the reason why you don't like balut  
um it's eating a live animal man that's like it's 
dead it's not a lie you know what I mean it's  
like you're crunching bones and I was crunching 
on Bones happened to me three times I polluted  
quite a bit a few times and I was crunching 
on Bones and I said no I can't do this anymore  
okay so but but it's one of those things a lot of 
guys won't touch like what are there anything else  
that you won't touch you yeah Dorian man oh no 
no no yeah I tried Dorian and I felt like I was  
eating a fart and then it's like fleshy it's like 
you're eating like rotten flesh and stuff like  
that when you're going through that so yeah so I 
I agree feeling like I feel like I'm eating poop
it seems like somebody falling into and I said 
um I swallowed I swallowed it too and um again  
I would eat balloon again before I would do uh 
Dorian yeah no I I would agree with that one no  
you know because like all of a sudden like your 
your other channel popped up in in my feed just  
like like that right and uh it actually popped 
up in my other my other YouTube profile which is  
more in the you know the manosphere type of stuff 
that's where it popped up before it popped off in  
my where my channel stuff is I was like it's Jay 
I was like I was like what's this I was like you  
know I was like this is Jay and I'm like actually 
with my boy and he's like who's Jake I was like  
anyways I was like so I was like I was like 
showing him and I was like so what what got  
you starting in in doing the more manosphere 
type because technically your main channel the  
black Filipino TV that is very manisphere like 
menosphere-esque it is but going to more to life  
what started that process for you um just 
seeing how everything was and then I seen  
when the passport I seen passport Bros it 
was a need for and it was taking off and  
I was right there like right right when it started 
becoming right there and I kind of I told my wife  
I said babe this is the thing and she did this 
because my wife she hears content like it but she  
didn't get it she didn't get until I started doing 
the content got it and then we have conversations  
after I do the video and I explain it to her and I 
go babe when I was in the states and I was playing  
situations I was in that happened like this and 
she's like oh she starts to get it I go that's  
why I'm here now right and she goes oh and you 
know when you you have conversation I explain it  
so I'll go to the things you do women don't do 
that there oh you're gonna say oh and then she  
starts realizing because man when people ask when 
guys ask women what do they bring to the table  
oh that's okay she can answer 10 15 different 
things 20 different things right the woman always  
clueless like what do you mean well I could tell 
you I edit his videos I cook his food I broke his  
back I I you know I do whatever he wants and that 
and and answer you know what the interest to that  
whatever it is you need me to bring to the table 
that's the answer it is you bring to the table  
because that's what I was that's the answer 
and that's what she does yeah it's not the I  
you know I have a job I make six figures like you 
know saying the stuff that a man's supposed to be  
saying and doing is like that's what they want to 
be able to kind of have now it's like do you get  
pushback from a lot of women like when they hear 
your content I'm like do you get those yeah you  
know what's funny it's kind of like women come in 
here and there but they really can't I think they  
they they do research on me everybody out there 
like he's been out there like he's not like you  
know some guys do the content but then they're 
not they never they never go anywhere right  
so you're different because you travel around 
right yeah some guys just do the content don't  
go anywhere and call themselves passport Bros 
and they haven't traveled yet and it's like uh  
you you haven't gone anywhere yet or you went to 
one place and then now you know I'm saying this  
that happens a lot it does so I mean woman that's 
a lot of times they make these videos they're  
talking about those guys yeah and that's what and 
then then they unfortunately bring us along and  
say well this all past Proverbs the same like not 
really you know it's like you know have you have  
you started learning the learning to speak the 
language in the Philippines like Tagalog or man  
I was learning and you was let me tell you 
man okay it's gonna take my wife I told her  
before she's a teacher uh-huh she's a 
teacher she's taught kids in Thailand  
English before right oh amazing yeah so 
she's good she was teaching me Tagalog  
and it's going to take her to just in the 
house to speak Tagalog to me no English wow
this is the force me the only thing about 
that is that everything I do is I work at  
a lot work online I speak English all the time 
so I'm home I don't really go out I go out and  
deal with people but a lot of times I'm I'm my 
brain is focused on what I'm doing right like  
sometimes you don't have time for small talk yeah 
I get you yeah like I can't hang around expats  
like that because I'm being real if somebody's 
just sitting like a lot of guys come on here and  
sit around all day drinking like I do that you 
know I don't do that like to kind of the way I  
operate is different like I'm gonna I'll meet with 
guys and say okay let's go walk let's go on a walk  
and talk right yeah and and plan something that 
we're gonna do together like that's me you know  
I get it man I mean wow so that's oh no I get I 
get it sometimes it does take some so wait what  
happens when K wants to watch a Filipino movie 
like um do you guys go out to movies and do you  
guys you know have you ever gone out to the movies 
and watch a Filipino movie yeah we have a couple  
of times [Laughter] wait let me give my second 
use the bathroom real quick no problem no problem  
I don't watch Filipino movies you don't watch it 
okay are you sure I was like yeah I'm not anymore  
because Jay want to watch Netflix English 
all the time they have Filipino movies and  
Netflix I like student tiger movie that's the 
one we watched together and we laughed together
I love Alex Gonzaga sorry I couldn't 
show my face don't worry don't worry  
about it it's late at night you know I'm 
surprised you know so you know oh I love  
me some Filipino movies though but I always 
prefer Star Cinema movies over Viva movies  
yeah and we only choose some movies 
either we don't watch it in the big  
screen but we want to come on Netflix 
but very often actually we watch some
it was like two I think there was a big sort of  
it yeah it was a long time ago 
just before pandemic [Laughter]
nowadays I'm trying to watch some you know English 
so you know I will be more like yo spontaneous
to what that's why I always bring you just for 
yours in my live stream I'm trying to be like Jay  
bro you're drinking water in the in 
the middle you know like 12 59 in the  
morning I wish I could do that bro yeah 
look at that that's like that's healthy  
right there like listen that's healthy right 
there no but like let's let's go into like  
um a few top key topic ones and by the way I just 
want to you know be respectful of how much time  
do you have to give still so that I don't know 
okay awesome so you know since we're in the whole  
password bro stuff hypergamy right that's that's 
something that a lot of guys it's really hilarious  
in in the niche that we're in in regards for the 
Philippine passport stuff are not familiar with it  
when I bring it up I always get huh what what are 
you talking about explain that like so you know  
I mean maybe later on I'll put the 
definition of hypergamy here but  
does hypergamy exist in the Philippines for 
Filipinas oh yeah it does it's just not the same  
and why do you think it's not the same like I I 
and because guys will say something that that's  
not how Filipinas are I'm like no no it exists 
but that's exactly I'm glad that you know you  
agree with that how is it different for you and 
what you see well what's different about it right  
is the needs of the woman number one it's 
not as major right not perfect me here  
is a man just being able to provide it's very 
simple right it's not a man having a bench  
it's a man maybe having a car 
right yep it's different it's a man  
being able to put a roof over my head not a man 
having you know a a 10 bedroom house or a mansion  
that's that's the difference between the 
Western here and what women are willing to do  
for for a man is different too because a woman 
a lot of people don't realize about Filipinas  
the people that watch content know they 
know about it but is that Filipinas a  
lot of times the one to break that back for 
you right and the Filipino will have a job  
make more than you and still treat you like a man 
here right and even happens with the Philippines  
before it's not all foreigners have money yep 
right A lot of people think guys are coming here  
and they're just taking care of the food no 
sometimes some Filipinos are still working  
and have to provide while living with that phone 
that came over here I see that a lot also yeah  
and it's different man it's much different because 
like I always thought people was like hypergamy is  
something that exists in every single woman the 
question is it's like what does our environment  
dictate you know in the U.S women do see other 
women with six figure earners women are easily  
seeing the guys with the Mercedes-Benz and with 
the Maseratis and stuff like that and it's easy  
seen in social media they can make sense because 
they can see physically and online so their levels  
kind of go up and what their aspirations and 
what they want whereas in the Philippines like  
you said they know that those exist they want 
it but they know it doesn't make sense because  
it doesn't exist around them sometimes right so 
it's like you know if they want to go from a you  
know from uh you know uh tricycle to at least a 
motorcycle motorcycle to a car that's going to be  
natural but it's like and for me wise I I preface 
it in regarding the part that because Filipinas  
tend to be more feminine so it's kind of I 
think the femininity offsets hypergamy of a  
woman sometimes because of what they want and most 
Filipinas and I always say this most Filipinas  
want to have somebody like you said that's a 
provider they really look for a husband they  
that's that's that's the number one thing that 
they have is to look at this you know yes um so  
it's just crazy in the in that sense of things so 
where What's um what's the plan for you like what  
are your plans like you said you earlier on you're 
going to be you guys going to be traveling a lot  
like where are these beautiful places you're going 
to actually uh I haven't been to Cebu yet man  
what really yeah no oh yeah and I met with my boy 
Roy who actually he got proposed I was with him  
he got proposed Filipino and he went to Cebu and 
people were seeing him saying hey I seen you in  
Jay's video and I know I'm gonna say a lot of 
people I know there I'm going to meet up with  
a lot of people there when I go I gotta get this 
boo I have to get to a bit of a colon already but  
I haven't right there I didn't know at the time I 
went I went for a wedding but I need to go to Cebu  
I need to go to many different places you know 
I've been a couple places about about six been a  
Barack I already been to been uh Palawan you know 
gonna go there again You're Gonna Go Baraka again  
I'm gonna go to Barack around party season um oh 
yes the night's the night the night special the  
night parties with the yeah yeah yeah I'm gonna 
go over there and catch that yeah I gotta catch  
that I gotta catch all of the oh you know how 
you know why I gotta catch it too so oh my first  
content that's you know you can plug that GoPro 
right there and just record and then just change  
the music in the background and people are gonna 
watch like if nobody's ever been to Boracay nights  
um it's a completely but you have to you have 
to reserve your your hotels now man you don't  
want to wait until the last month man I know I 
know I know and I'm working on doing that now  
yeah I mean I I will always suggest the hen 
in hotel like that's my go-to any one of the  
hennens I I love seeing a Boracay um but yeah 
that's that's always gonna be my go-to hotels  
in Boracay no but I mean yeah Cebu I think is good 
I mean I would recommend I mean if you like fried  
food there's a place I ate at like a month and a 
half ago called Fuente I just put a video on that  
it's all fried food man and you just like just 
it's already in front of you you just grab it  
and just keep on eating and tell them how many 
you ate okay so Boo's fun man you know I think  
that that's uh yeah that's yeah I think Cebu 
is one of the nicest cities to go to or like  
um I always say it's the first city of mansion 
land to in the Philippines sometimes just I think  
so the reason why I think so um because you know 
it's like the cities and Allen's all right there  
like Manila you have to go up somewhere else right 
even to go to Puerto Guerrera is like a ways off  
um but in Cebu it's like it's right there 
it's all right there you know the whole is  
right there all those places are right there 
yeah so so like you know now that you're in  
the Philippines man or whatever you know now 
that you can have businesses really work in  
the Philippines the correct way are there any 
plans or businesses that you're opening up like  
physical locations are you still just doing online 
type of oh no I do want to do physical locations  
um I want to do food businesses okay and I'm 
gonna do food businesses that work and that  
will make tons of money in the city right yeah 
when people don't realize in the Philippines  
Philippines is that kind of place say if I had a 
certain to say if I I cooked soul food right and  
the Soulful restaurant in the Philippines it will 
make money the reason why Filipinos eat everything  
just one of those only places really like 
because like you go you open business like  
that and talent and won't make money a business 
like that and Malaysia won't make money or a lot  
of these Asian countries but in the Philippines 
it's gonna make money because you have a lot of  
foreigners that's going to come here that's 
going to eat it also the locals we eat too  
and soul food yeah yeah soul food ingredients 
are things that are available in the Philippines  
easily exactly and is are things that actually 
is eaten by Filipinos but you're gonna cook it  
the soul food way which is actually nice I 
mean they love Oakhurst in the Philippines  
they they're gonna you know so yeah that's gonna 
be good stuff actually uh a good friend of mine  
um you know he was saying that when he when he was 
in the Philippines with me like a few years back  
and he was like man soul food would work here 
like you know and then because uh and then he  
was like or some like some some fusion Dominican 
Puerto Rican food and I was like it's all the same  
thing almost man so I'm like you know yeah that's 
a that's a good idea man are you gonna have like  
the little small cards are you gonna do like a 
real restaurant um real restaurant carts you know  
like a combination of all right nice um I kind of 
want to um franchise with someone else is doing  
it's a lot of stuff I'm gonna get into yeah um 
I'm gonna get into the clothing thing with my wife  
which I'm already into that with my wife the what 
oh the clothing business okay old man clothing  
business is huge um she's doing it right now on 
shoppie and uh Tick Tock so you're gonna do that  
um a couple other things man but I don't want to 
talk about it too much I just want to do it and  
then content of like hey this is going on you 
know that's how you can do it too yeah are you  
are you still doing the um the the courses for 
like the teach you know how guys can like work  
in a in a thing in a in a in the Philippines 
or Thailand and stuff are you still because  
I remember a long time ago you were talking that 
you're planning to create a course I think that's  
awesome is that something that that you have 
already or yes well actually um I'm teaching  
people like directly like I'm I get them on I do a 
consultation and I'll show them exactly what to do  
okay but I think I think the biggest thing of 
what to do another guy that's doing it right now  
I think the biggest thing to do is to kind of 
have your own BPO right hire Filipinos to work  
for you you know get get them money get certain 
money for a contract and hire them that's when  
you're gonna make the most but a situation 
like that you can find yourself making you  
know 500 to a thousand hour because you got other 
people working for you once you get up and going  
so you're doing like me talking about like VA 
work or BPO as an app they're answering the  
calls or making the calls for the client you 
know as they they're they're making a calls  
for the client okay it can be both it can be 
customer service work you can be um sales sales  
which actually that's easier because with sales 
everyone needs someone in calls for them right so  
yeah it's like to get those contracts and then 
get those started that's right about filipinos  
with sales it's that four hour work week you 
know type of stuff you know your job is to  
find the clients you sell it and then you have 
somebody some people handle it and just delegate  
the thing I do something similar but mine is just 
outbound calls um but yeah I think that that's  
that's awesome man so like if they want to sign 
up for the course or they have to like reach out  
to you like in the email or just contact oh yeah 
yeah um oh no actually I haven't buy me a coffee  
but I'm gonna set it up okay I'm not gonna set 
it up right now to where I'm gonna have it like  
strictly to the website you know the person yeah 
drop the email and they get a bunch of emails from  
me kind of like the old squid everybody else does 
yeah but email marketing still works man email  
marketing I'm still involved in email marketing 
for my other businesses so you know guys should  
understand you still are you doing Affiliates 
though right yeah I'm gonna do Affiliates too yeah
[Music]
I still do some Affiliates still a little bit 
um not as much as before but for my client like  
because uh when we make websites for our clients 
I'll do an affiliate with GoDaddy sign him up  
with GoDaddy for their website so I'm still making 
money after the website's made in a way so I mean  
just but they need GoDaddy for their server you 
know so it's like because that's that's where I'm  
doing it is website creation like I find clients 
who needs websites and I find a Filipino that can  
make it for 150 and then I charge 1500 to 2 000 
for The Weather Channel game man but that's that's  
what I teach guys too and um yeah it's better 
to do it that way yeah but the thing though is  
what what what's important to be taught is because 
that's why I won't teach that's your job right is  
how to get the clients where to get the clients 
how to close the clients because a lot of guys  
think well yeah I can find a Filipino like yeah 
but do you know how to where to find a client  
that needs a website do you know how to follow 
up do you need to do how you know how to make  
an initial introduction a cold call do you need 
do you know how the contracts that need to be  
placed those are the most vital part of that CLA 
there was you know it is it is that's awesome man  
uh as you know if there's like um three things 
that you can like um tell guys as your biggest  
advice for men that are interested in either you 
know just going outside the country that they're  
in maybe Philippines or any other um country 
what would be those three things that you can  
kind of like Drop knowledge for well number one 
would be just do it man so many guys hesitate  
um hesitate to to try a different place I say 
just jump into a head first and always remember  
that you don't have to stay if it doesn't work 
out um you know so many guys get caught up and  
guys come up come here and get become broke 
in the Philippines and they're scared to go  
back just go back home don't think oh you know 
you're too good because people are going to make  
fun of you so what if you got to go home go home 
and then you work on your plan to come back you  
know so I should have guys I say that to guys I 
think that's really all three wrapped into one  
because yeah I said don't be don't be afraid to 
go back home um also on top of that [Music] um
and this is to my guys that are not retired yet 
so see the biggest thing is you have to be retired  
to go to the Philippines and um I preached so 
strongly against that because I've been doing it  
and the thing is if I want to be out in the 
Philippines for another 40 years I could be  
for another 40 years right so like that's 
that's what I can say too is that you know  
if you have some know-how if you don't have 
know-how get some know-how if you if you feel  
stuck in the U.S okay learn how to do sales you 
can pick up a book on themselves people can train  
you on it if you do a job where you it's physical 
labor start doing customer service right something  
you can work online you can be online or doing 
customer service and make 15 20 to 25 bucks an  
hour because doing customer service and be living 
like a king out in the Philippines with that job  
you know yep and and that's what I can say to guys 
like you know don't be scared don't thank you oh  
I'm stuck at this job right now in the states 
and I'm doing manual labor you can change your  
life around doing something else I completely 
agree man yeah I cannot deny that those are the  
important stuff now okay so three three biggest 
red flags that a guy need to watch out in a woman
other than other than the money thing because 
that's that's gonna be like that's easy right yeah  
um so yeah that's standard um 
what a guy can look out for is um  
when a woman doesn't answer any of your questions 
sometimes you get some Filipinas who will make it  
seem like Everything you ask that's like personal 
they'll avoid it right and that's a red flag you  
have to watch out for because Philippines open 
books right talk Filipinos yeah so if he leaves  
not open book run right if she's not openly 
answering everything up front right away run  
um that's the big one right there run um 
also another red flag you can look out for is
when you come here and say if you meet your lady 
in the city and you never really really get to see  
where she's from I think that's something that 
you need to be be careful of because almost every  
Philippine is from Providence even the ones in 
the city exactly even because my ladies from from  
the private she was in a city a lot of her life 
because she she moved here for opportunity but  
she's from The Province right so um if you know 
you can't see what's going on in the province then  
you need to be worried you'd be okay then at 
that time it's like okay I don't know who you  
are really you know because I haven't seen how you 
are in the province I haven't seen your background  
in the province like my wife will tell you man 
um when she came up um and this was happening  
in the province all the girls were having babies 
right so my father had to be so strict with her  
and other sisters to make sure to keep them to 
not get pregnant right because it happened in  
the province and guys always say oh you know they 
act like they can't no that's what I'm saying to  
you earlier it can things happen in the province 
so if you can't see her surroundings where she  
was from yeah that's a reflective watch out for 
and um what's the third one I can't really think
there when uh let's say oh yeah if um 
you get with her and she doesn't jump to  
I know it sounds controlling some people saw Jay's 
being controlling but if she's not jumping to  
do everything you want I know it sounds crazy and 
I'm not gonna I'm not a controlling bad Mike but  
because that's what Philippines do man I feel 
like that's when the Philippines are natural  
habitat she's like oh you want to eat something 
oh you want to clean it for you all the time like  
Philippines are like that so if you're not doing 
that then just like okay if she's like always just  
want to sit back and not clean and you know you 
got to be careful this is not okay you should at  
least be trying to please me right I'm all the 
way out here in the Philippines and I'm willing  
to provide and if a woman's not jumping to do that 
then it's like okay you're getting yourself into  
a modern woman back home like don't come to the 
Philippines and get a modern woman you know so I  
said that right there that's good man but anyways 
I'm gonna end it right now right now for now but  
then so for everybody else to understand if you 
haven't gone yet go to Black Filipino TV and then  
also make sure that you check out mortal life is 
another channel that Jay has and of course there's  
a few more other channels with K and everything 
so yeah but that's all in the description and in  
his uh in this channel but I'm gonna put the 
description to those book two website I mean  
those two channels down below so people can see 
it and I had fun man I really appreciate this
watching videos
