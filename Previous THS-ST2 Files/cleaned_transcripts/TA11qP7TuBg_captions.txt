i have some beautiful meat here and this meat 
can get really soft first i'm chopping the beef  
in smaller pieces then we're gonna set it aside 
in the bowl for now so i'm making a food from  
australia today this is a new series on pinoy 
planet and it's called all around the world  
i cook filipino food and i thought why not be 
a little bit creative and combine filipino food  
with foods from around the planet so today we 
start with australia and we're gonna combine  
this australian meat pie with some filipino food 
i am super excited for this new series because  
it will be such a different way of cooking 
that we have not done before on this channel  
we're starting with australia to be honest i have 
not made the aussie pie before so this is gonna  
be my first time but of course i looked up some 
recipes and i really love meat pies challenge  
of course is to find the filipino food that 
will combine well with this food from australia  
i'm getting gutom i wish you could smell this 
angbango guys so let's add sibuyas to be honest  
i don't know so much about australia or food 
from australia but what i do know is that those  
baby kangaroos they are called joey like my name 
we're adding a little bit of soy sauce to this
tomato paste for a good umami flavor
patis which i think um gonna give 
an an extra boost of umami flavor
let's give it a good stir i'll also add a little 
bit of star anise and some bay leaves laurel  
a little bit of tomato ketchup
there's already tomato sauce but also tomato 
ketchup and finally some good quality beef stock  
let us add a little bit not too much because it's 
already salty with the soy sauce and the patis  
i'm just gonna add a little bit 
to cover it then stir everything
and then it's time to add in the beautiful meat
i will cover this beef and we're 
gonna simmer it for about two hours  
in the meantime we'll prepare for the filipino 
food i cook filipino food all the time but  
honestly this is the first time ever for me to 
make this one of course filipino food is often  
with rice but my goal is to find something that 
combines really well with the australian meat and  
then i actually saw that there is a pinoy version 
of a potato salad so today i will make this pinoy  
potato salad which i think will combine perfectly 
with the warm meat pie you know especially when  
we're gonna serve this chilled so i really can't 
wait to try this filipino food combination today  
there we go some butter then we'll add the nice 
ham that we cut in cubes give it a little stir
and set aside yung pork
we'll boil some carrots
i will put the potatoes and also the itlog all 
together lahat so the itlog can go for about 10  
minutes because they're gonna be hard-boiled 
so i took the eggs out after 10 minutes but  
the potatoes and carrots still need a little 
bit longer i'm already preheating the oven  
at 220 degrees celsius so now we're going to 
prepare for the aussie meat pie using this one  
uh you know they are not so big see this is 
kind of a small size but i think it's nice  
so that everybody can eat two or maybe 
three carefully putting in some puff pastry
so and then i'm carefully cutting around 
the edges to remove the excess dough  
now you know i don't think this needs to be done 
so uh perfectly you know just put in the dough  
like that cut around the sides and 
then we fill them with that lovely  
meat mixture and oh the smell is so amazing you 
can really smell that star anise and the spices so  
we still have a little bit of meat as a leftover 
but that should be no problem of course we can  
eat that the next day with rice so i think they 
already look amazing now we need to cover them  
so what i did i just cut the extra dough you know 
the excess dough and just gonna put it on top like  
that like i said we don't need to make it too neat 
it's our first time anyway by the way i removed  
the the star anise from the meat and also the bay 
leaves and i had let the meat cool off for a while  
now we're putting an egg wash just some egg on 
top so ready to go in the oven now i'm curious  
how many filipinos are living in australia 
the potato salad should be easy to finish now  
we have the carrots the potato and itlog i also 
have one chopped onion here that we will add  
and of course let me know in the comments how you 
make the pinoy potato salad like i said this is  
also the first time i'm using uh pineapple then 
the uh ham cubes that we fried in butter earlier  
so i wonder also if maybe there 
are some viewers from australia  
at this moment let me know in the comments 
if you're from australia okay um celery  
some mayonnaise now i tasted a little bit of 
the beef already and the taste is really nice  
so i can't wait to try it with this filipino style 
potato salad so let's also add a little bit of  
sugar one teaspoon and some salt and then we're 
gonna mix lahat and i think this is going to be  
a nice potato salad so i almost made it like a 
mashed potatoes you know i made it really fine  
i think that's nice because often they combine 
the mashed potatoes with the australian meat  
pie oh it's the moment of truth i took them out 
of the oven ah there we go and you know what i'm  
wondering of course i'm wondering how this will 
taste but i'm also wondering what will be the next  
country in the all around the world series 
okay so let's uh have a try uh you know what  
let's put a little bit of tomato ketchup on top 
like that oh the smell is amazing bon appetit  
wow oh it tastes amazing still maiinit 
and of course i'm also trying the  
filipino-style potato salad which is cold 
by now wow pretty good i think it's a great  
combination these two dishes from two different 
countries australia and the philippines if you  
want to see more you have to wait for the next 
one but i'm curious to all your comments thank  
you so much for watching maraming salamat po 
see you next time with more filipino food!
