beef
and ground cheese for jollibee spaghetti

we have some ground beef
and some shredded or ground cheese
and we have onion garlic
spaghetti and
pasta sauce so when is the last time you
went to jollibee

favorite food
in jollibee i like the
chicken joy of course
and also
i like beef tapa
and mango pie
and of course the spaghetti which is
very matamis
i almost forgot the hot dogs
i think that's very important for
jollibee spaghetti
so let's warm up some hot dogs
hot dog
okay i'm also chopping the hot dogs
small pieces
and we're gonna fry them a little bit
with some garlic
so let me know how i'm doing it
do you have any other way of making
sweet filipino spaghetti
just put in your comments below
thank you always for your comments guys
i've seen people from
uh mindanao, visayas
manila area, batangas, pangasinan
so again always let me know where you're
from
and which filipino food is from your
area so that
then i will try next time
OK the hotdogs are ready so let's put in
some onions
okay let's put in the beef
look who's there again
guys the meat is almost ready and the
water is boiling so i'm gonna add
spaghetti
this needs to boil for 11 minutes so see
you soon
let's add some pepper and salt
it's time to add the tomato
sauce pasta sauce
that sound means that the pasta is ready
i'm gonna add sugar asukal
to make it matamis
okay guys
if you like this video please don't
forget to give it a thumbs up
reduce the heat i'm gonna add a little
extra
tomato ketchup
and i'm gonna add the hotdogs that we
made
earlier okay i'm adding more sugar guys
because it needs to
taste like Jollibee
finally half of the cheese
mix everything through
 
 
there we go guys this is my filipino
style
or Jollibee style sweet spaghetti
let's give it a try curious to this one
i'm using a spoon maybe that's very
filipino
because i think the spaghetti you
normally eat with a fork
anyway let's try
um
but very tasty i like it
maybe not the same as jollibee but
it's very tasty after all so thanks a
lot for watching guys
and see you next time with more filipino
