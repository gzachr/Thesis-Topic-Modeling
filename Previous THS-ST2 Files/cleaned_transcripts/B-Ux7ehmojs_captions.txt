foreign
what's up this is Addie here welcome back
to my YouTube channel I hope you guys are
doing good and thank you so much guys for
watching my other AGT reaction when I watched
putri Ariana performance that was like one
of the most emotional moments I have seen
in a long long time it was really good and
one of my big brother who watches my videos
from Philippines he requested me to check
out this Audition of Roland abante he's from
the Philippines and he came all the way to
United States and be a part of this audition
so like everyone else like who knows about
Philippines or if you guys are from Philippines
who are watching me from a long time or maybe
if you're new here just a quick reminder that
you know I always appreciate the culture and
music scene of the Philippines you know especially
because of the love they have for the 80s
music the 90s the early 2000s and the late
the new new generation bands you know you
have like all different categories of audience
and for all this artists from around the globe
I know people who love the latest populate
this rock there are people who loves those
lionel Richie days you know Whitney Houston
days there are people who loves this eight
90s alternative rock stuff you know The calling,
Three Doors Down default, Three Days Grace,
and blah blah blah there are people who loves
the early 2000s like the Cueshe, river Maya
or maybe you know S lapshock so there are
so many bands which have been a part of the
culture or the music scene of Philippines
that's really amazing so I'm really really
excited to check this person um I'm sure that
he's gonna pull it off really well because
there is one thing for sure you know um music
has always said about whether you are sad
you were happy you always listen to music
and at the end of the day I also think in
that way I believe even if I have everything
in my life even if I become the richest person
in my life but if you take music away from
my life well I probably will be non-existent
I won't be able to survive so music has always
been a part and parcel of my my life and without
it it's it's hard to believe that life can
exist so I understand where you guys come
from and you guys are from a country which
appreciates music in any form and that's the
best thing keto does the best thing so guys
I'm really excited to check his uh audition
I will be checking it in in some time but
just a quick reminder also that my name is
Addie I'm from India I'm from I make reaction
videos on travel culture music and a lot of
other things and guys if you want to support

to so guys without wasting much time let's
check out this amazing guy from Philippines
we are ready guys
hello hi what is your name and where are you
from Sir
um I'm Roland Avanti I am from Philippines
what will you be doing for us today [Applause]
so he's gonna sing tonight you're gonna sing
for us okay and um so are you are you a singer
in the Philippines
so 
in the Philippines he's just saying in the
neighborhood where they have karaoke okay
so you join us karaoke for fun can I ask you
a question you have a Day joke
and then I would like to tell one thing because
you know Philip the Philippines was a part
of the uh the Spanish Community there are
a lot of words which are so similar when it
comes to Tagalog and Spanish a lot of words
like for example for Kanta (canta) or trabajho
or those kinds of words You'll Always Find
in Spanish language also which is very part
of the modern Tagalog language it's a mixture
of lot of Spanish words that got mixed up
at the time of the colonization and this is
how a language evolves honest but I'm sure
that the old Tagalog script or the traditional
Tagalog language will be very different from
what the modern generation people speaks usually
right just what I just figured out from this
conversation so far
so in the Philippines my work is in the morning
I'm a fisherman and in the afternoon I I do
drive a motorbike and I deliver passengers
and goods wow [Applause] got talents uh
oh you make him cry uh every night I see in
my cell phone only because I this is my big
dream you hit there to be here
Roland do you want to have a hug before you
start are you good okay okay okay
[Applause] wow that's the biggest Catch of
the Day yes [Music] [Applause]
good luck to
black tea he has not even started singing
man it's so emotional already your God [Applause]
he's so nervous I'm nervous now for him too
[Music] [Applause] [Music]
[Music]
oh man oh [Music] Michael Bolton whoa
[Music]
[Applause] [Music]
foreign
[Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause]
it's his birthday
baby baby
[Music] [Applause]
can I just say boy Heidi that hug really worked
I think you could have done it better Mike
dropped it all 
on that stage you were amazing you should
be very proud of yourself
this is where you need it to be yes yes man
you were so nervous
and it actually made me love this audition
even more and I really like you yeah thank
you so much thank you I agree with what Simon
said you know the you have a few years no
it's okay I think he gets excited with Simon
his favorite judge oh this is
I gotta say that I think Simon's absolutely
right it's the emotion and we could feel your
heart and I think that everybody just heard
a life-changing moment
um there's no space inside in his heart about
his happiness right now the joy man ah someone
who has craved to be a musician forever can
always understand another musician's feelings
and how it feels to be in a platform where
the world is watching you and you you've got
to do the best and you do the best and then
everyone appreciates you nothing else is more
precious than you know this Moment of Truth
the what he has been through I mean like Roland
uh kuya like you are amazing I wish you all
the very best for what you have done in your
life so far and I think all your hard work
and struggle and whatever you've been through
in the Philippines will finally will be sorted
and you will have a better lifestyle and people
will start appreciating you for what you've
done this is such a life-changing moment for
this guy man whoa whoa I have been watching
so many uh auditions from so many years but
this is the second AGT reaction I have done
so far uh in last one and a half year the
first one was definitely put three and this
is the second one I usually don't do that
because this kind of story is like where people
come from different parts of the world and
share their stories you know it's kind of
really breaks me and I don't feel like you
know uh for the sake of making a reaction
videos for the sake you know just end up crying
and showing people because I don't know how
people will take it because I'm kind of a
really sensitive person when I hear stories
like this because I know the struggle for
what he wants to and the struggle and the
struggle that I have been through for what
I want to be it's kind of you know kind of
same like we had been through in that phase
of life where we feel like that there's no
hope left but he has proved that you know
you should not give up on your dreams you
should keep fighting hard and hard and hard
don't give excuses don't give reasons don't
procrastinate just keep focusing on what you
want and finally one day you will be there
where you are supposed to be you know people
like him really inspires me and just kind
of melts me and breaks me apart also but for
all the right reasons man but what an amazing
song and Michael Bolton you know um I love
one of his songs tell me how am I supposed
to and apart from that this song is also like
one of my favorites and how beautiful he has
done it man damn and no wonder the Philippines
and it's people and their love for music is
forever Evergreen and eternal guys it's an
amazing feeling man I'm so happy that I came
across this audition and I'm wishing him all
the very best guys do let me know in the comment
section guys what do you think about it I've
always been fascinated by this amazing artist
from the Philippines and with this note this
is Addie signing off from this video I will
be back again guys with another one and in
case if you guys have any requests or if you
want to share your story or something like
that feel free to use the comment section
