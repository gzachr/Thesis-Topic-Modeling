because in the Philippines there's two kinds of malls and I discovered
this just recently you got the nice
malls right and then you have the jeje malls
you know the jeje malls
the one in Guadalupe that one
I just went there
and it was horrible
I just
it was like an immersion program
for me
all five minutes of it okay
before we get into this joke can we let
go of our conscience tonight
can we let
go of judgment because I kind of felt
you guys kind of backed off you know
like we were with you until you said
that and now we're like, we don't want to be
called "matapobre" (elitist) we want to laugh
but at the same time it's not too dark
because you know somebody might
recognize me in here but tonight let's
let go okay let's let's just have fun
let's be politically incorrect can we do
that? is that okay?just for tonight and
then afterwards you can put your
judgment on yeah as soon as we finish
the show you can judge people again okay
but you can tell it was a jeje mall because
you know it's a jeje mall because you
see cockroaches dying of natural things
you know
like suicide
f**k this sh*t I'm
just gonna kill myself aaah!
that's how bad
that mall was you know
you could tell it
was a bad mall because they didn't even
have the fake brands they had the fake
brands of the fake brands.
