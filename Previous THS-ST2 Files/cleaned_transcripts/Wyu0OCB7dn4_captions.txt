security keeping us in they know the people out so  
much shape or form we'll uh we'll wait for the

on the schedule so we will continue working our 
way towards the main Circle here but eventually  
we're gonna peel out of here and uh find ourselves 
into some street food all right we were able to  
break away from the festival the pilgrimage um it

everywhere if you just use it to stop up  
all the chili all the sauce all the soy

it's really nice ice burn yep I can still talk 
but uh barely so great I seen her when you're

flip it inside out and your hands are clean  
so you top top of the bag and you flip it inside 
out all right here's the trash thank you ma'am
all right well we'll polish up the rice and 
we'll be on our way but uh yeah good first  
little stopping again Michelle just a nice a 
nice eye I mean you would never necessarily  
suspect this place on Google there's only 
like nine reviews so it's just there's a  
crowd and that's what kind of catches the eye 
so knowing nothing about kind of what it was  
just seeing people asking at least stepping 
up and helping us out we got a great little  
meal several hours later here we are uh back 
inside the main Circle and you can see it is  
way more crowded in here than it was just a couple 
of days ago of course as we approached kind of the  
summit of the party but we are back Granite 
yeah are you ready for this yep the loots we  
have finally found it so we're going for the 
semi-fertilized duck egg here okay all right  
so Cedar are you gonna jump in on this theater 
you're passing on the balloons Forest [Music]  
all right well great it might just be you and 
I we'll take two okay I'll take this on granite  
okay okay granite and you're gonna peel that apart
okay we got our crack repealing 
the eggshell can we zoom in all  
right yeah you can see it's a little bit liquidy  
yeah okay so should we add salt now all right so 
the guy saying we should add a little salt now
okay A little salt
vinegar [Music]
okay so first thing they say is you 
drink the broth all right all right
tastes just like um chicken broth honestly like 
chicken soup yeah that subscribe it's pretty good  
so uh nothing really uh weird or funky about 
that part so you're just drinking uh from an  
egg okay now we uh peeled more do you eat it 
in bites or you slam it I don't think I'm gonna  
slam this it's pretty big all right so okay 
well as you can see it's a little bit of a uh
multi-layered looking thing all right 
I guess I'm gonna go for this part next
Marshall
more soup yeah so you can kind 
of keep drinking that if you want
okay all right you take a bite are you gonna 
take a chunker oh man I eat the whole thing  
yes one bite you can kind of see there's the 
embryo just a little guy there [Music] okay
I feel no bones are not crunch or 
anything no there's like the yolks  
wow a little more soup in there yeah 
you gonna do that one all right buddy
[Music]  
support here and then just the yolk at the bottom 
so that's about it and we got the whole thing  
it's great the hard white a 
little more broth in the bottom
that's great [Music]  
all right so the balloon experience what do you 
think Granite it's really good that's good it  
tastes like just a like a soft little omelette 
honestly did you get any crunches or bones or  
anything like that how many gays is this one 16 
okay so you can order 12 16 18. the older the  
more days the more develop the chicken butt 
15 is pretty good because it wasn't like so  
like oh there's literally a uh chicken here so 
you can see yeah pretty good right good yeah  
go up so that is the balloon experience these 
guys I mean so many big crowd I imagine a lot  
of people are kind of waiting for us to move 
on so pretty good yeah balloon together yeah
