to pick up where we left off after a
great first day in Manila we were so
excited to see more of the city but I
got hit hard with a bad case of food
poisoning that lasted the entire week
before we knew it it was time to leave
Manila we're leaving Manila
short one and a half hour flight to Cebu
and landed at maktan island where we
took a grab across the bridge to Cebu
City's South bus terminal from there we
boarded a four-hour bus to our final
destination
located along cebu's western coast
all right you can't be back there babe
[Music]
are you uh Korean yeah
how did you know
thank you
nice and cozy room here so I get a table
to work on editing yeah
[Music]
yeah everyone we're gonna do some
canyoneering so we're waiting for our
bus right now we're gonna go and get on
board and then we're gonna start our
tour
s
so we're in the jeepney ride we're told
that after we get there they're gonna be
a one guy for three people kenyoneering
is an adventure sport where you descend
through a canyon by hiking climbing
jumping and more and we heard that Moab
wall is famous for it so we booked a
group tour for 1500 pesos each
all right so we just arrived and first
thing that we do is we're filling out an
injury waiver so I'm a little bit
nervous so we just have to be careful
are you ready yes I'm ready
getting geared up so we have a vest that
we wear we have aqua shoes and we have a
helmet look at you
yesterday I'm ready
okay thank you
ready I'm ready
oh yes
this is such a better ride than the one
that we rode in here to get here they
somehow fit 14 people in one jeepney
we're here we're all geared up and we're
ready
so we're just waiting for others to get
here I think there is like a final check
out for your safety gears and then they
go take you down in a group there are
loads of people here and they're just
like a sea of colors because the helmets
are just colorful neon green and orange
helmet and for us obviously we're red
helmets I'm getting kind of nervous why
I'm kind of scared really I'm excited
we're at the top right now and we found
out we have a 45 minute walk but they
give you the option of taking the zip
line instead
that's really tempting so it's 600 per
person 600 pesos walk or zipline I don't
know
okay so we have a 45 minute walk to the
falls and I think I heard there were
seven points where you can jump off the
falls
for now six gotcha I only have to be
brave six times today
what's the tallest one 10 meters and and
supposedly it's 14 meters but the 40
meters jump it's close oh okay wait wait
44-0 a 1400. I get one one pass no 14
meters yeah but 10 meters it's still
pretty tall
my goodness
the road is nice and paved
all right so we just made it through the
first part of our hike and we met up
with the zipliners and then we have 10
more minutes down and then we take our
first jump first jump let's go
[Music]
all right so we're getting closer and
you could hear the screams From Below
scared tourist down the Falls below
that'll be us soon well I'm starting to
see the cliff over here
first job
it's cold water it's
waterfall behind us yeah
look at the cave-like looking wall over
here oh my gosh
is it yeah
they gave us some instructions they said
when you jump It's really sucks you have
to hold your nose like this is not like
this so I'm ready like this I could do
this let's go okay how do you feel
before your first jumps
[Music]
oh
how was your first jump oh man it was
really fun I was a little scared at
first because I'm a little scared of
heights but no worries it's not it
doesn't hurt whatsoever jumping into the
water it was really great
yeah and the guys are really helpful
they tell you like where to put your
feet where to jump and everything so
it's been great so don't
don't climb down on the side like that
but jumping was definitely the way to go
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
thank you
left right in the middle
you did it
oh my gosh this is so much fun guys that
is crazy and now we're gonna do the
victims up there
let's go to the big jump don't say this
is seven meters which is pretty high
where are we gonna do it
but yeah you can do it
oh my God
there we go Sarah
you did it that was a long jump it was a
really tall jump
so much fun
Philippines is
so beautiful we're just diving through
this gorgeous Canyon so you get
Adventure you get amazing views you get
fun tour guides I saw your back flip man
it was cool
so one other fun part about Canyon
nearwatch
is
the thing
I'm just kidding so one other fun part
about Kenyan earring is that you get
these insane scenery of coming out of a
jungle cave almost and you see the
sunlight coming out and it's so
beautiful it really matches with this
cleave that's covered in green Vines and
tree leaves it's so beautiful okay
[Music]
so when you're climbing over these
slippery rocks a lot of times you have
to be on your hands too it's because you
don't want to slip and my GoPro doesn't
float so I have to hold on to the camera
as well
wow so we're halfway through and there's
a sand selling barbecue near me
[Music]
look at these skewers
hot dogs
uh no it's okay thank you
I'm gonna bring my wallet from the hotel
looks good
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
one dude there you go
another cool part is so you can just
float down the water
what is the cool part about canyoneering
babe everything
try it it's amazing
[Music]
all right so our last final jump is that
Tall Tree over there
joke
so I'm really glad they gave us some
aqua shoes to wear because otherwise our
feet would have been sliced in half and
would have had a difficult time walking
over these bumpy rocks
what do you think that was amazing the
best way I would put it is the Nature's
playground Nature's best playground all
right so we're about the last Falls as
you can see behind me there's a jumping
point it's a cliff and people are
aligning
great jump and it looks too super tall
it's 10 meters high you know it's been
giving me a bit of a pep talk so I'm
ready all right we're going up baby you
got this
it's a pretty steep way up if you ask me
okay
[Music]
we also took our turn on a rope swing it
didn't go as planned
hahaha
foreign
[Music]
[Applause]
Rush right until you don't get into the
water
[Music]
hello
so I noticed a lot of the waterfall
obviously is naturally made but they put
the stairs here places that you can hold
on to I think it's a really good mix I
love it yeah and you always have a guide
telling you where to put your feet where
to jump and they're always helping you
along so it makes it a lot easier it
takes the fear out of it so as we go
through these walking Parts there are so
many beautiful places to take pictures
and to look at one after another it's
just non-stop just beautiful waterfalls
at last we reached the bottom of the
falls from here we checked about 15
minutes out and had a quick simple lunch
that was included in our tour we dropped
off our gear and finally we hopped in
the Jeep need to head home
so we just got back after an amazing day
of canyoneering that was a blast I
highly recommend you're going to be near
mob Wall go canyoneering it's totally
worth it time went by super quick it's
already 4 P.M uh we left about 8 A.M in
the morning and I just flew by that's
how much fun we had thank you for
