Let's eat!
Food and sharing in the Philippines.
Come across a Filipino eating, and they will
normally say "Let's eat!", or "Kain tayo!"
in Tagalog.
It's an
invitation to join them to eat, and typical
of Filipino generosity.
What should you do next time this
happens to you?
A necessary education for those in an Australian
Filipina relationships.
"Let's eat!"
First time someone said "Let's eat!" to me,
I didn't know what to say.
I'd already eaten, and wasn't sure
if I was supposed to go and join them.
But this is what Filipinos do when they're
eating and there's
someone else around.
It's almost automatic.
And I can remember another time on Bantayan
Island many years ago where one of the locals
invited
me to come and drink with him and his barkadas
(mates) after I bought him 3 bottles of the
dreaded
Kulafu (tastes like drain cleaner and cost
P3 per bottle at the time) so he had something
to offer his
guests.
Gave me a stump to sit on, a glass of this
amazing beverage and a lump of pig fat.
Fortunately I
was able to discard the fat by tossing it
under something without anyone seeing me,
but I struggled
down the drain cleaner.
But yes, as I said, Filipinos and generosity/hospitality
go hand in hand.
Eating by yourself and being
oblivious to the needs of others, it just
isn't done.
So whether you have an abundance or whether
it's
something very humble (like that awful lump
of fat), you offer it to whoever is present.
Try this little exercise next time you see
a Filipino eating something.
Ask them what they are eating.
And
guess what they will do?
They will immediately offer some or even all
of it to you, without hesitation!
Do you know that when particular religious
groups come knocking at the door, your average
Filipino will
invite them in and offer them refreshments?
They will do this even if it means they need
to politely sit
through attempts to convert them, because
it would be rude to treat a guest any other
way!
Does that mean you need to stop what you're
doing?
Is it rude to say no?
No, not at all.
You can always
politely decline, and no one will be shocked.
And if there's not much to go around, I'm
sure they're just
that little bit grateful to hear that you're
busog (full).
Know what's a bit odd?
OK, what do you say if someone offers you
something in Australia and you don't
want it?
Someone asks "Djawannacuppa?"
or "Djawannavegemitesanga?"
(I'll let the Australian
husbands explain those) or similar?
You say, "Oh, no thanks."
Or "Not at the moment, but thanks
anyway" etc.
In the Philippines?
You sort-of screw up your face and say (in
a slightly evil-sounding tone)
"I don't like!"
You can imagine my shock first time I heard
that!
You could think of asking "You don't??
But you had some just before?"
Answer?
"I know, but IIIIIIII dooooooooon't liiiiiiiiiike!"
Yes, it means they
don't want it right now!
Not that they really detest that particular
food or beverage!
Cultural clashes over Filipino food-sharing
Food is an important thing in the Philippines,
obviously stemming a lot from the fact that
hunger exists
and many live day-to-day.
Could well be nothing but rice for dinner.
So food is definitely life, and sharing
keeps people alive.
Having guests over means food.
Birthday celebrations means food.
Baptisms,
weddings, funerals and of course the Barangay
Fiesta.
First one I went to?
Fed beef caldereta at every
household I was taken to.
Told each lady-of-the-house that hers was
the very best and won a few pogi-
points.
Thought I was going to burst!
Again, all about sharing.
To shut the door and keep the hungry out
would never happen.
I can remember a time in the distant past
where I was visiting *cough* former girlfriend
in Cebu.
I don't
know what it is about Cebu, but the lechon
manok there (barbequed chicken) was absolutely
delicious,
and nothing like we have in Luzon.
So what did I do whilst staying with her at
her parents house?
Get a
single chicken, and we would eat it.
Get enough to share with the parents?
Never crossed my mind.
I
almost wince in embarrassment to think of
this now.
Shudder to think what they must have thought
of
my lack of manners.
Confusion works both ways, of course.
I recall a couple we knew years ago, with
the lady being an old
friend of Mila's from Hong Kong.
Arrived in Australia and complained to Mila
that her husband never
"offered her food".
She expected him to say "Let's eat", etc.
and he didn't.
It's not that she wasn't
welcome to eat.
He just didn't see the point in saying that
to his wife, when he expected her to make
herself at home and not wait to be asked.
Mila would also be amazed if we visited an
Australian's place and find they'd only made
one main
course.
In Australia we ended up getting a new table,
because when we had guests the table and the
kitchen bench were full to the point that
there was no room for anything else.
No chance of actually
eating at the table, because there was no
room.
And at one stage (I'll get into trouble for
this!) a party
meant her getting up at 4:00am and becoming
a complete food-nazi to everyone in the house,
and after
the guests had left (along with their doggie-bags
of baon), those household would be left with
shattered
nerves and leftovers to eat for the next week
or more.
I've calmed her down a lot since those scary
days,
but no one is ever left hungry rest assured.
That's the Filipino way.
