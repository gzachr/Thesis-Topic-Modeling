three IELTS tests two visa applications and
four OSCE tests I finally got my UK rn pin
dear Manong
hi Manong George here welcome to the channel
a lot of our viewers and followers share with us their stories
for today we want to share with you
an inspiring story of self-determination and hard work
let's hear their story here at "dear Manong"
dear Manong, how are you?
I would like to share with my story about my UK nursing journey
my story is not the typical nursing story, you will hear as if its like from MMK
wow, "malaala mo kaya?"
believe it or not, it took me 3 IELTS and 4 OSCE tests
before I could pass and receive my UK pin
wow
that's tough
unfortunately I did not get the writing I only got 5.5
they said they couldn't understand my writing
failed again I was so close 6.5
yes I passed
I thought there were no more hurdles
I even said to myself "UK here I come"
but no Manong not yet
during my application what happened was my visa application got denied
they said the details on my COS were wrong
good thing the hospital was able to fix it, the hospital that's in the UK
but it took two months for it to be fixed from the original plan of flying in december
it took me until march before I could fly
we landed at Heathrow finally, London!
Yes
we were welcomed by the Filipino community
they were the ones to give us a tour in and out of the hospital
the support from the Filipinos in that community was immense
they gave us reviewers from previous Filipino OSCE passers
they helped us even during the reviews
I heard shouting and crying from the people I was with
I was a little nervous
and there it was
it turns out they had already received their OSCE results
oh my gosh, here it is
so there I was acting casual
"hi, hello, thank you, congratulations"
but I hid in my room I locked the door and I checked my results
moment of truth
I did not pass
the 2nd try was more crucial
why? because our hospital spoke to us and they told us
if we don't pass it in the 2nd time around we won't be able to work
and we'll be asked to go home
really straightforward, the pressure was intense
once again I hear shouting and crying
I know what that meant Manong
it was nothing else but the OSCE results
so again same old story
"hi, hello, congratulations"
they passed
meanwhile I hid again in my room and locked it
and I checked once again my results
here Manong, all I could do was cry I was just crying
good thing Manong I was able to get hold of my sister
she told me "don't worry I'll help you"
even if you had to go home to the Philippines and repeat all the test
it's ok I'll help you until you achieve all of your dreams
but Manong, there was a lot more
of what my sister said but I was just crying he whole time
good thing there was also a guy who told me about
a similar case that a nurse wasn't able to get his pin on his 2nd try
he said there is an agency I can refer you to
and
because I had no where else to go I went for it
I was nervous at first I even thought that maybe this was a scam
but I really didn't want to go home a loser I had to take risks
I remember looking at my bank account and saw
that there was absolutely nothing left all I had was 150
they processed my papers and they helped me review for OSCE 
and gave me a job temporarily as a nursing associate in a care home
while I was waiting and reviewing for my OSCE
but since I was on the process of waiting for my curtailment
let me just cut there
curtailment refers to the awaited date that she will be sent home
I was only allowed to work for 20 hrs per week
back then my salary was only less than 600 per month
so with that 600 per month salary I still had
accommodation, food, and my travel for my OSCE reviews
my budget was really tight
I really lost a lot of weight back then
so our friend here was forced to diet
I would not be able to handle that
I remember one the conversations I had with my mom
I said to her
"mom, I'm sorry I will not be able to send money for now."
my mom said to me
"that's ok, what's important is that you are ok there."
it was so hard
I felt I was in the brink of depression
I failed again but now in the skills section
I was a bit complacent, Manong
after failing I took the test again as soon as possible
and finally I passed
3 IELTS test, 2 visa applications, and 4 OSCE tests
I finally got my UK RN pin
you know what Manong, when I passed
I had mixed emotions 
maybe as a result of all my hardship, I had no joy left in me
but at least I was able to feel some relief
yes, I felt the load was taken away
but I'm not sure Manong, I didn't feel happy
I am now working as a charge nurse in a hospital, Manong
I had such a hard time, I never thought that this would happen to me
I thought I was good and strong
I felt I had achieved a lot back in the Philippines
but these failures and experiences humbled me
it humbled me and it also made me stronger
it made me also appreciate the people around me
in all the challenges I went through so many people helped along the way
I was amazed on how God gave me these people and these learning experiences 
for real, never give up
when I went home for the first time back to the Philippines
after all those challenges
when I saw my mom and my grandmother
they hugged me
that was it
my tears just poured out, Manong
that's the only time I could finally say, Manong
yes I have made it
and I am happy now
I just want to say thank you for sharing your story to us
not many people would have been capable
of handling what you've been through
but like you, hopefully those people who are
going through hard times right now
they could realize that
there are still a lot of people willing to help
and it's up to us to identify that and find our opportunities
