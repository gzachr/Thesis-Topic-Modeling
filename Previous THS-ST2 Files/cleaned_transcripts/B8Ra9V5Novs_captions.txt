Mabuhay everyone!
Welcome to another travel vlog in the Philippines...
Maayong Buntag!
What did you say, love?
Maayong Buntag (good morning)!
No, it's not...
Not at this hour...
How should I say?
Maayong Gabii (good night)!
We're learning new words...
Welcome to another travel vlog
If this is the first one you watch
you have a lot more to see
to follow our adventure in Cebu (check them out later)
We just arrived at our new resort...
We're at Amorita, in Alona Beach
and to get here was a big adventure!
We lost the whole day...
Don't know if you noticed, but it's around 6:30pm...
almost 7pm, actually... and today was full of setbacks.
So these tips may come in handy if you ever visit the Philippines.
We checked out from Badian Island at 9am...
and we only arrived here now!
We lost the whole day in dislocations.
When we left Portugal we had planned
going from Badian Island to Cebu City...
To catch a ferry boat.
By car, from Badian Island to Cebu City is about 3 to 3:30 hours drive during the day...
By night, around 2 hours drive, cause there's less traffic
But during the day, they told us to expect at least 3:30 hours drive
and it could be more, depending on the traffic...
plus 3 more hours on the ferry boat... the right one
We were told the ferry that also transports cars might take more than 4 hours!
When checking out, they suggested another port
a port in Argao...
Which was closer, about 1h30m drive...
Where we could also catch a ferry to Bohol.
But when we got there, the ferry was broken!
"I'm so sorry, but there's no ferry today..."
And we were like: "really?"
Now that we lost about 1 hour to get here do we need to go to Cebu City?
Thankfully no. We found out there was another port
and it would only take us 10 minutes drive to get there!
There it was finally... a boat!
Great price! We paid around 1â‚¬50 each
But it only took us to Sandingan Island...
After we had to catch a local Bus...
And a tricycle...
We only met our resort transfer driver after all this
We lost the whole day...
Note to self... we only ate the 7am breakfast...
since them till now... nothing.
Just ordered some drinks...
had our welcome drink...
So we're really hungry and in need of a shower!
We're only waiting for the room key...
We have dinner reservations...
So... let's go...
Yes, please!
If we talk about money...
There's a time vs. money compromise...
That you need to think about.
Overall, with all these trips...
We only spent 4 euros per person.
But we lost the whole day...
Sometimes people don't want to spend money on taxis...
They don't want to ask for transfers...
Because it's a bit more expensive...
But it really pays off not losing the whole day traveling...
Today we can't enjoy the hotel...
And this is amazing!
I'll show you.
Have you chosen?
Yup, I'm having grilled squid... and you?
I was thinking about grilled tuna steak...
I think you should choose that and we split it...
Yeah, we ask that and we split it.
How amazing is this metal straw?
For me that I love to bit them...
It's so hot...
Are you sunburnt?
Wtf...
I'm really burnt...
Can you see it?
Perfectly...
At least I'm not going home looking like a milk glass...
Today we just spent the day here at Amorita...
It's such a beautiful resort!
The infinity pool is amazing...
This morning we went to Alona Beach
to do Paddle... It was my first time...
and taking that into consideration it wasn't so bad...
I wasn't able to stand up...
You didn't but I mean... the sea was tough for a first time Paddle practice...
Yeah, but even so I did bodyboard and surf for a couple of years...
And I couldn't manage to stand up...
I never did that and I stood up!!!
The sea is a little bit wild...
It's windy...
But I'm gonna make it!
Without giving up! Let's go!
Now? Near these rocks?
Go...
If I fell... it's on purpose!
a lot of waves...
You can do it!
We're recording, it has to be now!
It' awesome...
But it's so hard...
What? What a clown...
How I miss bodyboard...
Used to be so easy...
It was a long time ago... oohhh those golden years...
Of my life!
You're old!!
We booked a dinner table...
The most special one in the resort, with an amazing view...
Right next to the infinity pool...
There's this table...
We asked what it was...
And they told us it was for romantic dinners,
for couple's to enjoy a date moment...
Yeah, they have 3 menus and we chose the "Sinta" one...
It has some grilled fish and we miss that...
"Sinta" means Beloved...
Now it's time for a shower...
And to get ready for dinner...
Very nice!
Want some help?
Stop! Go away with the camera!!
Want some help baby??
You're so funny today...
Come on!
This is so beautiful...
And we have music!
So, what are we having for dinner?
I'm trying to figure it out because I forgot what he said...
This is Sea Bass, right?
Grilled Sea Bass...
Squid...
Mussels...
Under a bed of...
Tomato vegetables?
Am I right?
Pepper, tomato, onion...
