the philippines
and slovakia has the weirdest way
of celebrating easter holiday and in
this video
you're gonna see why
[Music]
hi everyone my name is kim and i'm a
filipina living here in slovakia
and in this video i'm going to compare
how philippines
and slovakia celebrate their easter
holidays
youtube canali miatsum filipinka
giudzana slovensku
i think it's pretty obvious that easter
is one of the most anticipated holiday
of the year although in the philippines
we actually call it
holy week let's start with the
philippines where the traditions
are highly influenced by the spanish
well because
we were colonized by them for hundreds
of years
just like in slovakia in the philippines
we also have
a long holiday from work we stop working
from monday thursday
until easter sunday where all the shops
establishments are really close
but even before that some of the
hardcore devotees
start observing some cultural traditions
like
ash wednesday and i think for this year
it was sometime in february
during ash wednesdays the filipinos
attend mass
where the priests would mark their
forehead with
a cross made of ash
[Music]
this serves as a reminder of the
solemnity of human mortality and that we
should reconcile with god
i also consider this as the start of
lantern season in the philippines
and then there is palm sunday where i
think this year it was on march 28th
during this day the catholic devotees
are attending a mass
with their palm leaves which we call the
in tagalog palace pass
so that the priest can bless them
[Music]
i have a lot of memories during palm
sunday because i remember when i was a
kid i was so tiny
and i was always carrying this palm lips
and trying to get into the crowd so that
i can get that holy water on my family
because the filipino believes
that this blessed palm leaves will
actually
scare away the ghosts the bad spirits
the devils in their house
and will bring good luck to their family
i know it's crazy
the week after which we call the holy
week a lot of processions
in the street will happen but i think
the most anticipated
and the most popular i believe
is the procession called flagelland
procession
and in tagalog or in filipino we call it
penitentia i'm pretty sure that a lot of
you guys have seen this in the news
because philippines is quite popular
with this
and i think i have one viewer who
actually asked me about it
in this procession you will see devotees
mortify
their own flesh by weeping
[Music]
they walk on the street with crowns made
of thorn
just like jesus and then they whip their
back with
some kind of metal chain or something
and on the end of the procession there
are some devotees who would go
further and would have themselves nailed
into the cross just like jesus
[Music]
basically this tradition is to imitate
the suffering of jesus
the devotees believe that in this way
they are sharing the pain that jesus had
before he died
i know pretty heavy stuff i remember i
didn't like it when i was a kid as well
but my brothers always wanted to watch
so we always go
i would stand on the side of the street
and the blood would splash on me
from the men who are whipping themselves
in slovakia there is also a similar
tradition of
whipping but i would say it's far more
gentler than that of the philippines
i don't know if slovaks are also
practicing this but in the philippines
40 days prior to the easter we do
fasting
and usually the most common is
not eating meat and the biggest fasting
happens on the good friday
and during this time you can expect that
the prices
of the vegetables and the seafoods in
the philippines will go
up just because people are avoiding to
eat meat but what i like the most
is the maundy thursday in slovakia which
they call green thursday i'm not sure
why
during this day the ladies of the house
are so
busy preparing baking cooking
easter food the most common food during
easter here in slovakia are pastries
breads egg cheese
there's also rudka or smoked pork that
came from
i actually made a video about that so
make sure to watch it as well i think
in general here in europe the most
popular activity especially for kids are
painting these eggs which here in
slovakia they call it kraslitze
krasliche apart from these the ladies of
the house decorate the home with
easter symbols like lambs
small bunnies yellow cheeks
eggs flowers i'm not really sure what
are the meanings of this symbol so if
you guys know
leave me in the comments below also
people would collect this
plant or flower called zlatidast
did i pronounce that right zlatidas
and they put it on the water and they
hang their
eggs this decorated eggs on it
but i think nowadays they don't collect
it anymore because they can easily buy
it in an open market
i saw it in military last time i believe
and then the men are also collecting
willow branches to make the kobach
and this is the whip guys that i am
telling you about
which the man is gonna use to whip the
woman of the house
then on easter monday the girls have to
wake up so early in the morning so that
they can avoid
the thing called oblivaca
where the men are actually splashing
water on them
i think it's so cruel if it's me i would
be really really annoyed
but they said that splashing water to
the woman will make them beautiful and
healthy throughout the year
and then the men will go through their
village or maybe just the relatives
to get all the women splash them water
and
whip them with the kombats but they have
to do this before noon because it's said
to be impolite
to splash water in the afternoon some of
the men don't carry water but they have
this
stinky perfume which they use to spray
on the girls and i heard the smell is
not really nice
and after all these bizarre actions of
men
the woman would have to reward them with
some sweets
chocolate eggs maybe sometimes even
money
as a thank you for the water splashing
and the whipping
and for older men they are rewarded with
alcohol
and some treats
[Music]
and not only that they said that the
more guys
visit a girl to splash water and whip
her
the more the girl should be proud this
will surely
angry the feminists of the world but
this
is a cultural heritage here in slovakia
so what can we do
alright guys that's it for me today i
