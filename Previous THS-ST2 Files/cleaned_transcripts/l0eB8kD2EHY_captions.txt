- I love meat pies.
- It's like it's...
(Sharon laughs)
- Oh my God!
- People Vs Food on tour.
- I'm in!
- (PvF) We are headed to
some of the more than 1,000 islands
in Polynesia to try
delicious foods from the region.
- Ooh!
- (PvF) What do you know
about Polynesian food?
♪ (sad trombone music) ♪
- Not much.
I might've had some things before
and I didn't know it was Polynesian.
- I have like a bunch of friends
from the Polynesian islands,
and I've heard a little bit
about the food,
but I haven't really gotten
to actually try it.
- (PvF) What other countries
are in Polynesia?
- You can't ask me these things.
- New Zealand.
(bell rings)
Um...
- I don't wanna sound stupid,
I think that's my biggest fear.
I was gonna be like oh,
I mean, we said Hawaii,
is that a state, a country,
I don't even know, honestly.
(record scratches)
(Jillian laughs)
- (PvF) Is Hawaii a state
or a country?
- It is a state.
- (PvF) Yes.
- Yes.
- (PvF) I may have to use that,
I'm sorry.
(group laughs)
- (narrator) The first group
of Hawaiians
supposedly came in the 700 AD.
- Oh, Hawaii.
- (narrator) From the Marquesas
Islands, came over on their canoes.
Which you're talking about
coming to an island,
a group of islands
in the middle of the Pacific.
- Look at how beautiful it is.
- Oh, it's so beautiful.
- My God.
- Jungles and beaches.
- Like, I wanna go in there,
but I know I'm gonna get
bitten by a bug
and get like some
weird disease.
(Jaxon laughs)
- It's just crazy to think that people
literally came to a mass of land,
like a land mass,
and there was nothing there.
Like he said, put pigs and potatoes,
like what do you do with that?
Like, that's crazy!
- Figure out a tasty combination,
I guess.
- Yeah, seriously,
I'm excited to try it.
- (narrator) All the Asias 
that came in.
- Ooh look at that!
- (narrator) And brought their method
of how to cook.
And then you start
to mix and match styles,
a little bit of Filipino style,
with some of the Chinese style.
- Oh, the Filipino style.
- Mm-hmm!
- Oh, I'm so excited. (laughs)
- Ooh, okay, okay!
- Ooh!
- Ooh, okay, okay.
- Oh yeah.
(Sharon gasps)
- Oh my gosh!
- Ooh.
- Oh, you are giving us a meal.
- Oh my God!
- And we got macaroni salad!?
- (PvF) From the melting pot
that is Hawaii,
we have quite the feast.
First up, a classic plate lunch
with kalua pig, poi,
mac salad, and rice.
We've also got a bowl of saimin,
the nation dish of Hawaii,
and for dessert, we've got
malasadas and haupia.
- Oh, I gotta have this
mac salad first.
- The mac salad is 
obviously amazing.
- Hawaiian mac salad, to me,
has a lot more flavor than regular.
I feel like regular mac salad
goes with like salads,
you know what I mean?
- Mmm.
Hell yeah, oh hell yeah!
- That's very flavorful.
- It's just, it's like stripped down.
There are no like,
barbecue sauces or anything,
and I think it's even so much 
better without that distraction.
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay.
- Yep.
- It's almost like a pudding.
- That tastes bad.
- Not a big fan.
- Okay, it's a little...
- It's a little sour,
but it doesn't have too much taste.
- Mm-hmm, oh my God!
- Oh, that's delicious,
what is that?
- Is it good?
- Oh my God! (laughs)
It has this nice crisp
right when you take that first bite,
and right when you get inside,
it just goes instant doughy.
(noodles slurping)
- Wow!
I mean, that was the worst
ASMR. (laughs)
- If you're eating any noodle
soup dish,
and you're not slurping it,
you're not eating it right.
- Is this pork?
- (PvF) What is that?
- I wanna say it's,
what is this?
It's definitely pork,
it tastes like.
There's a specific name
for it though, right?
- Spam.
- You can't really go wrong
with Spam in like a noodle dish.
- Nicole, please, preach about
how good Spam is.
- (PvF) Oh, Spam's the best.
- Thank you very much.
- It is not the best!
- (PvF) I buy it by the case.
- I was always scared of Spam,
I was like ew,
but this is incredible.
- (Darius) This is Spam?
- For anybody who does not eat Spam,
like, give it a shot,
we understand that it's 
canned meat,
but if you prepare it properly,
it is delicious.
- It isn't!
- Don't listen to her.
- It is not delicious.
- Do not listen to her!
- Already, everything on this plate
is bomb.
- I was literally gonna almost
finish this entire thing,
I'm not even gonna lie,
I was just gonna keep going.
- No, I know, but we need
to like, save up.
- Wait, there's more, huh?
- Yeah.
- (PvF) This is just round one.
- (Darius) Oh!
(Jillian screams)
- How many rounds?
- (PvF) Five.
(Jillian screams)
- (narrator) We go to the markets.
- Oh.
- There we go!
- Let me just tell you,
that's my kind of lady.
- I'm gonna tell you
right now, girl!
- (narrator) We're looking for some
coconut.
- (gasps) Coconuts.
- Coconut.
- Oh, I can't wait
to try this!
- Yeah, I know it.
- The people are gorgeous.
Oh my God.
- (Sharon) Yeah.
- I know the flowers
are so cute!
- It makes me wanna go
so bad, just seeing that, like...
- (gasps) Come!
- Yo!
- Ooh!
- Woah!
- Okay.
- (PvF) From the beautiful
island nation of Samoa,
we have palusami,
a delicacy in Polynesia
that's made by wrapping
a beef, onion, and coconut mixture
in leaves, before baking.
Sapasui, half moon pies,
and then their national dish,
a coconut bread called pani popo.
- Yeah, like, this is 
a thick, thick pastry.
- I don't even know
what to do first.
- Me either!
- I gotta find out what's going on.
- I'm just going to bite here.
- No!
- What in sweet baby 
Jesus's name is this?
- Oh my God!
- This is one of the best things
I've ever tasted.
- Wow!
- 10 out of 10.
11 out of 10.
12 out of 10.
- Mmm.
It doesn't taste
like pineapple.
- It gives me like apple pie.
- Mm-hmm.
- What is this?
Look at that!
- Okay, it smells like artichokes,
have you ever had artichokes?
- Yes, it smells exactly like it.
- Mm-hmm.
- There's coconut in it.
Mm-hmm.
- Yeah!
- Ooh!
- Heavy coconut in that, mmm.
- Mm-hmm!
- I like this.
- I literally didn't have
to chew at all.
It's like I put it in my mouth,
and it just kinda like...
- And it just kinda melted,
and then you.
- (both) Yeah, it's so good.
- (PvF) So this is the national dish
of Samoa, it's called pani popo.
- Have you gone to
a different plane of existence?
♪ (angelic music) ♪
- I'm moving. (laughs)
- I have never seen Sharon
smile this big in my life.
- (PvF) What do you think
of Samoan food?
- They got the flavors up there.
- (Jillian) Yeah.
- Their flavor is...
- Mmm.
- I'll tell you right now,
you know, normally,
I'm like oh, my neighbors
get food and everything.
- Mm-hmm.
- Nope!
They ain't getting [censored] today,
let me tell you!
(Brian laughs)
- (narrator) When you say
Tongan people,
it means food itself.
- Oh, I think I've seen this
somewhere before.
- (narrator) Birthdays and weddings,
and funerals and everything,
and all those events,
it has to go with food.
- Yes, everything has to go with,
food is life.
- I don't know what that is.
It looks delicious.
- I don't either, but I hope,
I can't wait.
- Exactly, it's not a party 
without food.
- It's not a party.
- That's what I love,
like, their family gatherings,
they just make these like,
all these different sorts of dishes.
- Where are we going?
- We're going to Tonga!
- Woo! (laughs)
- Oh, we're vacay-ing now!
- Oh!
- This is vacay vibes!
(both laugh)
- Ooh, 
this looks pretty!
- Are you serious?
(sniffs) Oh, that is fresh fish.
- (PvF) So, like many of its
neighboring countries,
Tonga is a wonderful mix
of land and sea,
and today, we're trying
their national dish,
ota'ika, a coconut fish ceviche,
and 'ulu, which is breadfruit.
- I was not expecting that.
- Me neither.
- I feel like I'm eating
a pastry,
but then I also feel like
I'm eating an artichoke.
So it's like 
an artichoke pastry.
- It does have a potato consistency,
but and then there's 
the coconut in it.
- Mm-hmm!
- God dang, that's good!
- Mmm.
- I like that a lot.
- This is good.
- Mm-hmm.
- Try the drink.
- Mmm!
I almost forgot!
- (PvF) This drink is called 'otai,
it's a refreshing watermelon
summer beverage,
made with lime, pineapple,
and coconut.
- This is literally 
on the beach drink right here.
Like hands down.
- Mm-hmm.
- Mm, very fishy, to me.
- Wow!
- This is a ceviche?
- It's like a, what's it called,
a very marinated poke.
- That strong flavor.
- I'm not a fan of that one.
- I'll say, with this, it's not like
super salty, or super sweet,
or anything, like everything
is like very simple tasting.
- I would say it's a little bit more
on the plain side, yeah, but...
- Yeah, it's a little more
on the plain side,
but not in a bad way.
- It's like a ceviche
that's not really a ceviche,
but a stronger ceviche.
(laughs)
It's still the consistency
of the fish
that really brings out
the flavor of the fish,
if that makes sense.
There's fish in this, right?
- (PvF) (laughs) Yes.
- (narrator) A new morning
in gorgeous French Polynesia.
- Tahiti.
- Tahiti!
- Woo!
- (narrator) Time to learn
a little bit more about
what the Polynesians eat.
- I'm in!
- What's the sandwich?
- Ooh, all of that looked good.
- Woah!
- I recognize French fries!
- I recognize a baguette.
- That is a very hardy
looking sandwich.
- This is gonna be
very, very, fishy.
- Yes, and I'm here for it.
- (PvF) Their national dish,
poisson cru,
is very similar to Tonga's,
so instead, we've got 
some poulet fafa,
chicken cooked with coconut
and taro leaves,
a casse-croute avec frites,
and po'e, a Polynesian based pudding.
- Hmm!
- Woah.
(Jillian laughs)
Woah, woah, woah,
there's a lot going on!
There's a lot going on,
woah, woah, woah!
- Really, should I go for it?
- Mm-hmm!
- There is a lot
going on in here.
- It is a sour tuna sandwich.
- It almost wants
to be spicy.
- Yeah, but that's the thing,
it's so flavorful,
it almost counteracts
the fishiness of the tuna.
- Oh, it does
want to be spicy!
I am so interested in this.
- (Brian) Mm-hmm.
- I was not expecting that.
- See, interesting thing,
that would be something
that would be nice
with this to counteract it.
- Oh yes!
- Mm-hmm.
- The flavor difference
is crazy.
- Mm-hmm.
- You go here, 
it's like a safari,
like a wild jungle.
(Jillian laughs)
You come in here, 
and it's like a country club.
Like chilling, you know,
you're relaxing after.
- Oh!
Banana.
- Tastes like banana.
- Right?
It's banana.
- Ooh, I like it.
- Yeah, it's really, really,
really, really good.
It almost tastes like 
if banana pudding
had a baby with
a cacao plant.
- Yes!
- My parrot would love this.
My parrot loves bananas. (laughs)
- You have a parrot?
- Yeah, I have a parrot at home.
- Sick!
- You know what?
I just think we need to cruise around
the Polynesian islands.
That's my goal.
- Yeah, People Vs Food
on tour.
- (narrator) New Zealand.
- (gasps) New Zealand!
Woo-hoo!
- I didn't know that 
New Zealand was...
- New Zealand's Polynesian?
- A Polynesian island.
- (narrator) Lamp chops.
- Lamb chops!
- Oh!
You already sold me!
I love meat pies!
(Jaxon laughs)
They are one of my 
favorite things to eat.
- (narrator) Pavlova,
a legendary New Zealand dessert.
- Ooh, I'm in for that!
- Ooh!
- (narrator) And strawberry
bits on top!
Every year, the Australians
try to whine about it
and claim that it comes
from Australia,
it's not a New Zealand dessert.
- I like this guy,
he's funny. (laughs)
- (narrator) But it is, 
and just to keep them quiet,
we just keep beating them
at rugby.
(Sharon laughs)
- Oh [censored]!
(Darius sighs)
- (sniffs) Oh, I'm not drinking that.
- Okay.
It smells like a coffee.
- Yeah, I can't drink that. (laughs)
- You can't drink coffee?
- I hate coffee.
- Meat pie.
- Look at it!
- This looks like such
a great way
to end everything
we've just been eating.
- (PvF) From New Zealand,
we've got a delicious meat pie,
a cup of flat white coffee,
New Zealand's signature drink,
and a delicious pavlova,
with kiwi on top.
- Cheers!
- Cheers.
- This is really good.
- Oh, I would think 
if you like coffee,
a cup of coffee with this
would just kick, right?
- Oh, it kicks you
right in the mouth,
in the best way.
I don't know what you're doing
I'm just gonna pick it up and bite it.
- I wanna hear your thoughts
before I take a bite.
- Mmm!
- It's good?
- Mm-hmm!
- Meat pies are so good.
I cannot emphasize that enough.
- It kinda gives me
sloppy Joe.
- Like, a meat pie is just
the evolved form of any sandwich.
- Oh yeah, it's like
fancy sammy.
- I like it a lot,
I really do.
I think the flavor's great,
and this, the crust.
- It's perfect.
- Really complements the meat inside.
- What is that?
- Is it fire?
- Oh my God!
- That's like straight sugar.
- In the middle, it's like
marshmallow fluff.
- Okay.
- Oh!
- It's like it's...
- (laughs) What was that?
I got so excited!
- You really did!
- Oh! (laughs)
- Definitely my favorite, I think.
- Yeah, mine too.
This is definitely like,
it just everything I want.
(Brian laughs)
- That is so good!
- It's very sweet.
It's a very big contrast
from the meat pie
that I was just eating.
- Mm-hmm.
- I can literally, I think, die happy
thanks to this thing right here.
- Yeah.
- I swear, I'm like...
I don't wanna finish it,
but I am, you know?
Like, it's so good.
- We just have to find
a cruise line
that'll just take us
to every one of these islands.
- I am, I...
- And then you'll just get off
on one of 'em
that you like the best,
and never get back on.
- (PvF) That does it for today.
Any final thoughts?
- I'm moving.
I'm ready to pack it in and move.
- (PvF) What's your favorite thing
you ate today?
- Pavlova!
- I don't know, huh.
That's a hard one.
- The kalua pig was my favorite,
and also, the pavlova 
was really good too.
- Aye mate, that was a crikey
good flavored food!
- Crikey!
(both laugh)
- Thank you guys so much
for watching!
- What other foods should we
try next time on People Vs Food?
- Let us know down in
the comments below.
