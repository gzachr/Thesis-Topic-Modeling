fam over there oh good i ruined christmas  
before i forget merry christmas guys
so it gets all rough and [ __ ] when i 
do that see how it roughens like this  
but when that cooks it's going to get all crispy
nice
and the most important ingredient 
of this roast potato duck fat
okay cooking's done we're 
about to eat but before that
ready
it's like life without anxiety for six 
hours sorry fam so over there oh good
i ruined christmas
oh so saucy
sorry guys here's the fam this is daniel my 
brother you all have seen him in the past  
this is my mom dina this is our baby chrysanthe 
the youngest this is the other baby tim  
sandy's fiance if you all don't know tim then 
you better watch my past videos and the reason  
why i like blue because it's calming you said 
i'll get something on the way you always do this  
i didn't realize something on the way is five 
hours away i'm dying i need sustenance because  
then you'll know me everyone enjoying yeah 
yeah oh [ __ ] all right so got an announcement  
a little bit crazy guys i'm gonna 
start doing daily vlogs from today wow
what do you think daniel do you want 
to get a stroke by the end of the year  
maybe that's good so plan is loot for straight 
30 days but we'll see how it goes try it for two  
weeks first um pretty much most of those videos 
will be like a five minute video four minute video  
six week video i am not going to go hardcore 
no way i don't think i can do that and the  
editing quality probably won't be that good it's 
gonna be quick videos just every day for 30 days  
all right just so before i eat why i'm doing this 
hold on a minute i'm about to have lunch with the  
rest of the family but really i just want to tell 
you guys why i'm doing this daily vlog thing so i  
feel like i've got a lot to learn by doing these 
daily vlogs i get to train myself to edit faster  
focus more and you know if i'm if i've got this 
pressure to upload something every day to edit  
something every night or in the afternoon then you 
know i learn in the process a lot of other things  
i get to learn to and train myself to edit 
a bit faster and i think the biggest thing  
i want to do out of this daily vlogs is that to 
be able to find something interesting in my life  
every day i mean i want to show you guys that 
it doesn't matter who you are doesn't matter  
what you do there's always something interesting 
happening in your life you just gotta find it  
it's gonna be resourceful and that's another 
thing i wanna do in this data vlogs i will  
i wanna learn to be resourceful find interesting 
things in my life or even like something that's  
not that interesting and make it look interesting 
the art of storytelling that's what i learned i  
want to learn to story tell better i want to 
be able to storytell doesn't matter what's  
going on whether it's the most boring thing 
make it look exciting maybe talk about things  
that's going on every day current affairs stuff 
like that so the the quality won't be the best  
probably because it's gonna be daily vlogs 
quick editing target is 30 days but i'll try  
for the first two weeks see how i go as daniel 
said do i want to shrug by the end of this year  
we'll see how we go anyway now what makes a good 
latch on leaks i don't understand leaks leaks are  
okay you don't eat leaks right it's just a garnish 
you know uh no watch one is like a bloodshot skin
cracking i feel like we're at kicking in got 
your glove where's your big bag uh it's i  
left it over there can you move it for me 
yeah have you tried the sweet peel thing  
no no i i don't think i can do that all i 
know is that lechon is spanish influenced  
and a lot of other south east asian countries the 
cultures have similar roast big soccer freak-style  
dish um the closest one to lachon 
especially the cebu style that's on  
is ben bali bali bali uh what was it called 
again baby that's it they would say it's better  
yeah some say it's better i don't know 
we're filipinos that's not obvious  
but something i haven't talked much about in this 
channel hello filipino audience comment down below  
what is your favorite style nalechon let me 
know in the comment section but negro style  
pone electroni in favorite girl followed by the 
cebu i feel like and a lot of you guys know this  
tasting sauce as it is it's really 
tasty so i'm literally nice and i'm from  
a local uh lechon chef here's a sydney um 
the the business is called henry's the chon  
um and that's what i like about cebu style 
and necro style the chinese my last name
so and that's one of the things you need for 
a good lechon and in the skin less blisters  
smooth skin less blisters 
uh increased surface area  
that was makes a good lechon crackling hey 
sandy what do you think about me doing dailybugs  
it'll give you like a new new avenue to 
like express yourself doing this yeah
pistachio and i also made some of this red 
velvet cupcakes here having some gelato
yeah what i love about mapo is that  
they stay true to the flavor it says if they 
say it's a lot it tastes exactly like hazelnut
