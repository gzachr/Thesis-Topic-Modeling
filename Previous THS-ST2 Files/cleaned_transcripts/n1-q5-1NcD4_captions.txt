Morissette Amon is an incredible singer,
she is wonderful
and always makes everyone impressed.
Message given.
Let's go for what matters.
Let's react!
She is really amazing
It's interesting to see the ease
in the use of mixed voice
she uses the mask voice
but she also uses the chest voice to balance
the notes are not only emitted
in the mask voice.
And a little of the voice of the head,
to soften the notes.
She has great control over the Belting
and air emission
we have already made many
reactions to Morissette
she has a very loud voice,
very strong and powerful
and she is managing to control
all the vocal power she carries
in this video she uses a soft voice,
a different technique.
Morissette has great control
and mastery of voice.
Look ...
I did not want to pause
but I need to talk
about what we talked about earlier
on the use of mixed voice
the use of mixed voice
helps control the emission
because if there is no control
harmony can be lost
the harmony of the voice and the instrumental.
She knows how to use the voice
otherwise the note could be issued
in a very strong way
the tuning could be lost.
and how she has a great vocal domain
the instrumental and the vocal form a very beautiful harmony.
Wow.
-Wow.
She's perfect, right?
She always delivers the best
the best voice, the best techniques
and an enormous facility 
for making vocal changes
a great facility for making Belting transitions
for the head voice 
a softer voice and more air.
She has great control of the vocal chords.
That impresses.
she used many regions 
of the voice to sing
chest voice, mask voice
head voice...
Always using many vocal ornaments
Melisma, Vibrato, Falsetto...
Drives too.
That's it.
Morissette always uses many Drives.
Another thing is that the guy
who is playing Bass
I had the impression
that he is looking at the Partitura
at that moment
this is really interesting.
This shows that he is a good musician.
Morissette is a wonderful singer
and is always accompanied by good musicians.
-No doubt.
-She is an incredible artist!
But this is our opinion
now we want your opinion
What did you think of this incredible Morissette performance?
We love it.
