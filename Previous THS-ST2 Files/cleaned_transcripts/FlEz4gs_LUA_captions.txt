Hey Everyone!
Welcome to PH Dot Net
Today, we are at the famous Quiapo Market in Manila for another Filipino street food adventure.
Quiapo also has lots of great restaurants to try amazing Filipino dishes.
These Filipino dishes or "ULAM" are sold for only 50 Pesos per serving.
That's only around $1 per serving. 
And they're usually served together with rice which is only 10 Pesos or $0.20
Yum! Looking definitely incredible.
Turon!
This "Turon" is a favorite Filipino snack or dessert in the Philippines.
They're commonly filled with slices of ripe bananas then wrapped in spring roll wrappers.
But are also sometimes made with "malagkit" or glutinous rice instead of bananas.
We're lucky there's perfect weather today.
It's not too hot. Just light rain that comes and goes.
Look! We've found another popular street food "Kwek Kwek"
Street vendors usually sells them together with other Fillipino favorite street foods, fish balls and squid or chicken balls.
This is called "Lumpiang Sariwa" or Fresh Spring Rolls.
It's made of stir-fried vegetables then wrapped in a thin, crepe warapper.
They're served with this mouthwatering peanut sauce. 
Definitely healthy and nutritious!
And we've found this great spot to eat Filipino street food in the middle of the Quiapo market. 
They're serving here amazing "Pancit Palabok" and "Sotanghon Soup"
Looks absolutely incredible. You've got to try these too.
They also sell these great Filipino desserts.
Can't remember what they call these brown ones. But I absolutely loved these.
If you're in Manila for a street food adventure or to taste the best Filipino dishes, then you must visit Quiapo.
Just walk around the market and you'll definitely find lots of mouthwatering Filipino street foods. 
Thanks for watching!
