WHAT'S UP GUYS IT'S HERVE
I'M HAPPY TO BE WITH YOU AGAIN
FOR A NEW VIDEO ABOUT THE PHILIPPINES
FIRST AND FOREMOST I WANT TO THANK YOU GUYS
FOR THE MESSAGES OF SUPPORT
FOR THE EMAILS I RECEIVED
IT FEELS VERY GOOD
SO , TO BE BACK FROM THE TOPIC
I WANT TO THE PHILIPPINE FOR A MONTH
I VISITED 3 DIFFERENT ISLANDS
IN THE SOUTH
YOU NEED TO KNOW THAT IN THE PHILIPPINES , THERE ARE OVER THAN 7500 ISLANDS
IN CEBU , I HAD THE CHANCE TO MEET SOME DANCERS
WHO MADE ME VISIT THE ISLAND
I EVEN DANCED WITH THEM
AND I WILL TALK ABOUT IT , IN THE NEXT VIDEO
ABOUT THE TRANSPORTATION
TO TRAVEL FORM ISLAND TO ISLAND
YOU HAVE TWO OPTIONS
EITHER BOAT OR THE PLANE
THE BOAT TAKE MUCH LONGER
BY PLANE YOU HAVE TOW BIG AIRLINES
AIR ASIA AND CEBU PACIFIC
IF YOU WANT TO DO LONG DISTANCES
INSIDE THE ISLAND
YOU TWO OPTIONS
EITHER VANS OR BUSES
THE BUS IS THE CHEAPEST OPTION
AND HONESTLY IN THE PHILIPPINES , THE PRICE OF THE BUS IS VERY VERY CHEAP
WHEN I WAS DOING LONG DISTANCE TRAVEL , I WAS TAKING EVERY TIME THE BUS
AND EVERYTIME I WAS GETTING ON THE BUS
PEOPLE WERE VERY SURPRISED TO SEE ME
BUT THAT IS JUST FUNNY
I WAS USING AN APP
IT'S A GPS AND YOU DON'T NEED TO USE INTERNET
SO EVERY TIME
I KNEW WHERE I WAS
THERE IS SOMETHING  I ASLO LIKE IN THE PHILIPPINES
IS THAT THE TAXI DRIVERS DID NOT TRY TO RIP ME OFF
AND THE SAME FOR BUSES
SOMETHING THAT I FOUND FUNNY TOO
IS WHEN I WAS GOING TO THE MALLS
WHEN I WANTED TO BUY FOR INSTANCE AN ICE CREAM
THERE WERE VENDORS WHO WOULD HIDE THEMSELVES
WHEN THEY SAW ME COMING
THEN I JUST ASKED THEM : WHY ARE YOU GUYS HIDING ?
THEN AFTERWARD THEY EXPLAINED ME
THAT THEY ARE VERY SHY
AND WHEN THEY SEE FOREGNERS
THEY ARE SCARED TO SPEAK ENGLISH
I THINK IT IS SOMETHING CULTURAL
IF YOU HAVE MORE INFO ABOUT THAT , FEEL FREE TO SHARE PLEASE
THERE IS SOMETHIN COOL IN THE PHILIPPINES
IS THAT THE LOCALS TRAVEL A LOT WITHIN THE PHILIPPINES
THAT MEANS THAT YOU CAN MEET THEM IN GEST HOUSES OR HOTELS
AND INDEED TALK WITH THEM
THE PHILIPPINES IS A COUNTRY LESS EXPLOITED BY TOURISM THAN THAILAND
THAT ALSO MEANS THAT THE COSTUMER SERVICE
IS OFTEN POOR
WHEN YOU ARE  A FOREIGNER AND YOU GO TO THE PHILIPPINES
YOU HAVE TO BE CAREFUL ABOUT WHERE YOU GO
WHEN YOU GO TO TOURISTIC PLACES
THERE IS NO PROBLEM
IT IS VERY SAFE
BUT WHEN YOU MOVE AWAY
TRY TO BE CAREFUL , WHEN YOU WALK AT NIGHT FOR EXAMPLE
YOU WANT TO GO FOR ANOTHER RIDE TOGETHER ??
LET'S GO !
SO PERSONALLY
I NEVER HAD A PROBLEM IN THE PHILIPPINES
BUT YOU ALWAYS HAVE TO BE AWARE
SO I WILL SEE YOU SOON FOR A NEW VIDEO
