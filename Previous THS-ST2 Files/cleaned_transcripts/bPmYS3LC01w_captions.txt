THROUGH AND MIGHT BRING US A
TINY BIT OF SNOW, WHAT'S
COOKING?
THERE IS LOTS COOKING HERE
THIS MORNING.
THERE IS A NEW RESTAURANT
COMING TO THE LOWER EAST SIDE
THIS SPRING.
IT BRINGS TOGETHER A
COMBINATION OF SPANISH AND
FILIPINO CUISINES.
THIS MORNING WE ARE JOINED
BY EXECUTIVE CHEF JOHN PAUL.
GOOD MORNING.
GOOD MORNING.
THANK YOU FOR HAVING US.
LET'S GET COOKING.
THIS IS MY MOTHER'S RECIPE.
WE HAVE THE WRAPPERS HERE.
WE HAVE THE DIAMOND SHAPE.
TAKE A FEW OF EACH INGREDIENTS,
ONIONS, CABBAGES, TOFU.
WHAT IS THIS WE ARE PUTTING
IT ON?
AN EGG ROLL WRAPPER.
IT IS MADE WITH FLOUR, WATER
AND A LITTLE EGG.
YOU CAN JUST GET THOSE FROM
A LOT OF DIFFERENCE STORES.
YES.
ALL OVER CHINA TOWN THEY ARE
COMMON.
WE PREFER TO MAKE THEM OUR OWN
TO MAKE IT A LITTLE BIT MORE
EXCITING.
RIGHT.
YOU FOLD FROM THE BOTTOM
GOING UP.
THEN CLOSE THE SIDES.
THEN YOU ROLL.
MAKE IT A LITTLE TIGHT.
THEN YOU SEAL IT A LITTLE BIT
ON THE EDGE.
THIS IS THE FRIED VERSION.
WHAT DO YOU FRY IT IN?
DEEP FRY IN VEGETABLE OIL.
THEY COME UP IN NORMALLY THREE
MINUTES.
ONCE YOU SEE THEY ARE GOLDEN
BROWN, THEY ARE READY TO GO.
PLEASE TRY.
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.
I NORMALLY DIP THEM IN KING
VINEGAR SPICED WITH THAI CHILE.
THIS IS MY MOTHER'S RECIPE.
WE ARE HAPPY TO BRING IT TO NEW
YORK CITY.
IT IS ALL VEGETARIAN.
YOU DON'T MISS THE MEAT AT
ALL.
I LOVE MEAT BUT YOU DON'T MISS
IT AT ALL IN THIS.
AS A CHEF, IT IS IMPORTANT
TO SHOWCASE VEGETABLES, I
BELIEVE.
I THOUGHT THESE WERE GOING
TO BE HAMBURGER SLIDERS BUT
THEY ARE MUSHROOM SLIDERS.
IN THE PHILIPPINES THERE WAS
ONE PLACE THAT SERVED THIS WHEN
WE WERE GROWING UP.
I ALWAYS WANTED TO BRING IT TO
NEW YORK.
WE ROASTED BUTTERNUT SQUASH,
BREAD THE MUSHROOMS, COOK
CABBAGE AND SLIGHTLY TOAST THE
BUN.
IT IS PERFECT.
ARE WE GOING TO PUT ONE
TOGETHER?
YES, WE SHALL.
TOGETHER?
YES,
LET'S PUT SOME SQUASH ON THE
BOTTOM BUN.
SO THE SQUASH, DO YOU
USUALLY SERVE IT WHILE IT IS
WARM?
OR DO YOU WAIT FOR IT TO GET TO
ROOM TEMPERATURE?
TO ROOM TEMPERATURE AND THE
FLAVORS BLEND VERY WELL
TOGETHER.
EACH SLIDER WE PUT A LITTLE
PICKLED CABBAGE ON TOP TO GIVE
IT NICE ACIDITY.
PLEASE, ENJOY.
THANK YOU.
WHAT IS THE BEST WAY TO FRY
UP MUSHROOMS?
VEGETABLE OIL.
BUT THE TECHNIQUE IS TO COAT IT
PROPERLY WITH FLOUR, EGG AND
YOUR CHOICE OF BREAD CRUMBS.
FOR US, WE PREFER TO USE PANKO
JAPANESE BREAD CRUMBS.
THE TEXTURE IS PERFECT WITH THE
SOFTNESS OF THE DINNER ROLL.
WHAT KIND OF ROLL IS THIS?
IS IT A POTATO ROLL?
YES.
IT IS A KING'S BUN.
IT IS PERFECT FOR THE DISH.
LIKE THE SWEETNESS OF THE
SQUASH.
IT PAIRS WITH THE EARTHNESS
OF THE MUSHROOMS.
THIS IS A VEGAN DISH WE'LL BE
SERVING IN THE RESTAURANT.
SERVING IN THE RESTAURANT.
WE HAVE OTHER VERSION OF STEAK
AND POTATOES.
WE DO AN ASIAN FLAVORING WITH
ONIONS TO GIVE IT A NICE TWIST.
YOU SAY THE RESTAURANT IS A
FUSION OF SPANISH FILIPIN KNOW
FOOD .
PHILIPPINES WERE COLONIZED
BY SPAIN FOR 368 YEARS.
WE TAKE A LOT OF WHAT THEY LEFT
FOR US AND OFFERED KNIT
CUISINE.
IT IS GREAT.
