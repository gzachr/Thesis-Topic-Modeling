foreign
the tricycles are different all over the 
Philippines this is we stop for breakfast here
very nice finally I can take off meeting Apo 
Whang-Od for my bucket lists. The tour minivan  
picker house from Baguio at around 1 30 a.m. 
midnight the moment the vent started down the road  
i have a bad feeling the tour would be a vomit 
trip for me i get car sick pretty easily the roads  
are small and very curvy i watched several vlogs 
about the tour but no one mentioned the crazy road  
or driver seriously i want to warn anyone 
who want to visit Kalinga village you better  
prepare yourself for the mountain road 
from hell the road from Baguio to bontoc  
the halshema highway is the most 
dangerous road in the Philippines it  
is 150 kilometer long with land slide cliff 
drop off tight curve and almost no straight away  
this road from bontoc to kalinga is just bad but 
by that time you are already used to it plus the  
landscape and the scenery is so breathtaking the 
fear of death is not so overwhelming upon arrival  
in kalinga province you have to hide another 
45 minutes before you arrive in Apo village
we're on a cliff here the roads all the 
way up here have been hanging over forks  
beautiful country such a diverse and big country
i was really impressed with the local lady who 
carried the food on her head during the hike  
our tour guide joked that the lady can carry an 
adult cow on her head too that's what's so funny
the height was very stiff for the first 5 to 10 
minutes i slipped a few times but luckily nothing  
happens to me one of the members in our crew was 
not that lucky she fell and sprained her ankle it  
was swollen and big we close to rivers during 
the height the temperature cooled down when  
we near the water it helped a lot we have long 
legs and that's why we were ahead of everyone  
Apo village buscalan have no 
cell service but the scenery  
will take your breath away traversing 
the valleys and a vibrant rice terrace
here's some rice terraces
that's what rice looks like
we stop every few minutes catch our breath
oh
finally we arrive at the top of the 
village dragging our sweaty body we  
rest a while in the souvenir shop while 
waiting for the other to catch up the view  
is really breathtaking the wind is cool and 
the air is so much fresher than the city  
we're staying in this town 
yeah and then we should we go  
shower and then lunch and then we go for 
the games so after that is free and easy
once everyone was together we 
continued to our homestay accommodation  
the walkway was skinny and fall would be high i 
was quite scared i would fall if i lost my balance  
i just need more rest after the winding roads
do
so this is our showroom here 
and there's our view here
very nice there's a fish pond and then they were 
they have the tilapia inside and the milk fish the  
bangus before the trip i have prepared something 
for the Apo and the kid in the mountain in some  
blog website is saying that if you can you can 
just volunteer and bring down some coloring book  
or a lipstick for Apo yeah so they prepared a 
special salad for them and this is my food here  
after lunch and some rest we have to meet Apo 
the most famous tattoo artist in the world  
i feel nervous to meet someone that i have been 
dreaming about for such a long time apple is the  
last and the oldest man battle traditional 
kalinga tattoo artist in the Philippines  
some call her the bad ass grandma i always 
wanted yes i want her to be my grandma too  
apple 1 0 is 105 years young this year in 2022.
oh my god
she's like a little girl 
to me yeah she's a teenager
apple have young heart bright eye and she is found 
to be weak even though we don't understand her  
local direct i feel happy and positive when i was 
around her she came out dancing and was teasing  
young children from her village and display a 
very light-hearted energy about her according  
to the tour guide apollo is now only doing her 
signature tattoo due to her advanced age three dot  
for 150 pesos which is three dollar the 
three dog that represent apple and her two  
grand needs is despite a continuation of the 
art form the older generation to the next
historically kalinga tattoo were used for tribe 
heart hunter and woman of the indigenous people  
of butbut in buscalan the budwood volunteer 
tattoo by protect village or killing enemy  
who not longer as it apo now practice this 
traditional form on tourists visiting buscalan  
Apo meets 10 group of tourists a day on the 
weekend 10 group mean 100 people dan and i  
didn't get tattoo Seeing Apo was the joy we came 
to experience dan and i remained tattoo virgins
the whole trip was just meeting Apo and 
now we will dance the village have much  
to offer so we hide around the right 
terrace enjoy the serene nature the  
dogs are very friendly as they follow you 
around the dog worth all from our homestay  
this is right above the village 
here where all the rice fields are
it's a canal
i'm not sure i want to continue or not
slippery
this was a really good trip for us to escape from 
our laptop the charming rice film and the natural  
are really eye candy reaching apple take around 
15 hours from manila each way luckily we came  
from baguio which is only 6 hours each way 
i love the peace and tranquility of this  
village most of this video is about apple but 
we also really enjoy daily life in this village  
you can see the locals are working together 
to farm the rice they share some men were in  
contraction in the next town the village have 
a school here and a basketball court it is fun  
to watching people play in the late afternoon 
after work simple life equal simple happiness
so we took a seven hour car six hour car ride from 
uh baguio to here crazy and this i mean i've been  
on windy roads before like the windiest roads this 
windy but what was different about this road was  
there were parts where it's very steep and it's 
apparently there's a lot of erosion and there's  
like half the road will be gone 
that was in at least 10 places  
and there's no there's hardly any spots where 
you just go straight it's just curved curve  
curve really tight curves you can 
hear the rubber on the wheels spilling  
it was uh and it was it seemed like it was was 
it six hours yeah there was no straightaway so it  
was six hours straight of that it was probably 
the toughest mountain road i've ever been on  
because it was so long yes yeah crazy 
but where we are is kind of cool
we got to this village that the spanish never 
got to and it's famous for the tattoo lady yes  
and she's cute she's very cute and it's uh very 
nice people here very beautiful and it's just a  
crazy ride to get here that's true but some 
adventures are like that that's how life is
the long round winding road so beautiful 
all the rice the rest and that is a mountain  
there is a town that uh apollo is leaving 
over there and we just walk from that side  
and then slowly crossing here to arrive here 
that's the truth that's the truth we're looking  
for guest stars on vagabond awake these are 
people that have stories about where they live  
it's cheaper than living in their 
home country people that have  
used medical tourism to get a problem solved they 
couldn't get done for a reasonable price in their  
home country whether dental or medical guest 
stars are welcome just leave a comment below
it's nice to come out to the natural and you 
know enjoying the natural resting our eye and  
in here the phones have no connectivity at all 
so literally we are free from the outside wall
ah how you feel i feel good that you don't 
have connectivity from the outside wall whoa  
world yeah yeah it's nice i'm 
enjoying it it's very peaceful  
it's a nice location yeah except somebody 
keeps sticking a phone a camera in my face
yeah it's beautiful we're lucky we are lucky 
we're lucky people to see this part of the  
philippines that not much people will come to 
this part of the world yeah it's gorgeous yes it's  
it's a lifetime opportunity that's 
true let's go it's too late later  
we cannot get the light to go home so we have 
to walk fast now the sun go down here soon
well
thank you so much
yeah it's nice huh
good morning
oh
you're so beautiful huh
this is our morning view here it's 
green it's over green in the other side  
the grass is always greener on the other 
side especially since there's no grass  
on this side this side is small group well 
today we get back in the minivan and we go
for five hours six hours back tube so these 
these uh rice paddies are in all different  
these terraced rice paddies i 
should say are in all different  
levels of being ripe i don't know what the word is 
for rice but right and you can see here this one  
has already been picked through see 
there's no rice seeds growing on any of it  
well if you're wondering what a rice 
seed looks like here's one they missed
and then and also you can see the the pathways 
they walk through to harvest it by hand and then  
over here is one that's ready to be harvested 
maybe another few days or weeks but and you can  
see i don't know if you can see it because it's 
the gopro doesn't zoom in but there's it's all  
full of the rice seeds and then one over there 
you can see the pathways where they've already  
harvested it and most of the ones further down 
have been harvested except for a few over there
such a beautiful part of the world down on 
flat land they dry the they dry out the the  
rice once they harvest it on the road next to 
the road they lay out these tarps and they lay  
it out flat to dry it out but here the in these 
because they don't have the roads they build these  
little i don't know what you call them lean to 
huts and you probably can't see but inside there  
you can see all the harvested uh rice and it's 
still on the branch they capture the rain water  
in these little canals coming down the side of 
the mountain next to the terrace and over here  
you can see there's no water going into the rice 
paddy but these rocks here they adjust these rocks  
depending on whether they need to add water 
to the patty and that's how they use the river
oh
so the only tours to see the tattoo lady 
up here are like group tours that include  
where we're staying which is just a big room 
a bunch of beds in it so if that bothers you  
you're not going to be able to come get a tattoo 
i think the first one is the road what the road
that's chunks right up here nice 
morning walk back to the van okay  
okay okay so you have to walk all down and then 
cross all up and down and then go to the car  
over there are you ready no no are 
you ready you stay here forever okay
the building materials are all carried up 
here um and the one of the uh locals told  
us that it's 300 per trip so they make six bucks 
from carrying stuff from the trucks over there  
down the ravine to the water and 
then back up the hill to the village
so it costs more to build when there's 
no more when there's no roads you look  
over there red or small not a lot of people 
walking we're walking from over there to here
it's all the way down and um is it tiring
they riding on the van down to the city  
i think new york city if you've enjoyed

the bell thank you so much thanks for watching
