I never thought I was trying to see oceans 
in the Philippines exotic food you will try  
something exotic food oh they're 
alive they're alive oh my God how  
do you know it's a good sea ocean 
to eat okay Virgin Island area
good you have to buy you 
just swallow one two three
a balloon sea oceans are a creature that scare so 
many people but here in Asia and also in another  
countries around the world they are at the liquor 
scene eaten by so many people the other day I was  
walking here around Alana Beach a beach in the 
Philippines and I saw a man selling sea auctions  
actually I realized about sea oceans in this 
beach because the water went away that day and  
you can see a lot of sea urchins all around and so 
many children grabbing them well they grab the sea  
oceans to sell them here in the beach and that 
day I wasn't down to try it but today I am down  
it's not my first time I remember once I tried 
as the ocean in Japan at the tsukiji market but  
really to be honest I don't clearly remember the 
flavors so today I hope the fears and guides here  
in the beach um let's go find it find him to try 
this excited food here in the Philippines right  
now it's about 5 30 in the afternoon and this is 
how Alona Beach looks like a lot of tables from  
the restaurant a lot of people and still enjoying 
the water which because today it was cloudy and I  
think that has to do with the fact that the water 
didn't go away um so far so people are still able  
to swim around the beach there's also a few 
locals here enjoying the sunset as well and  
of course a few massage ladies and yeah guys 
this beach changes so much between the day and  
the afternoon so during the day the water is over 
there where that castle is and now look all this  
space but this fish it's definitely something you 
gotta come and visit when in boho yeah like that  
that's the name of the island boho I think this 
is the sea ocean guy yeah I recognize him by the  
white um how do you call the balde I don't know 
the name in English and of course a lot of people  
around him the other day they were also a bunch 
of people around him and right now too much music
