I also say he deglazing 
his toilet instead of flush
suit nephew
Hello guys! welcome back again to my channel
and today is reaction day again
we gonna react to the one and only...
taddaaahhh!!
Uncle roger reacting to ADOBO
I saw it on Facebook
and I say hmmm, I haven't yet react to any video of Uncle roger before
and I think I already saw his video about on how to make rice
rice, you know Mr Nigel? 
Uncle Roger so let's try to watch
his latest video, Adobo.
We all know that
of course I'm a Filipino
and I know there are so many ways of cooking adobo
so let's try to watch his video
so let's watch
so hilarious
I can relate because I'm Filipino
wait!
did you know that I already saw this video
making adobo with that exact same guy
but I never think or notice that it is wrong to add
parsley or something like
I just only watch him how they make the adobo
and now that actually Uncle Roger react about it
and yeah he's right and I realize it is wrong
this dish has many variation everybody make it different way so we're  
hard to [ __ ] up but this nephew jeffrey wearing suit to make 
Asian food  
haiiyaaa
Uncle Roger don't have good
feeling about this it's traditional dish 
a Filipino adobo I can smell the spices
less, I also buy low sodium soy sauce
but I also have regular soy sauce, especially Filipino soya sauce
very inexpensive white 
vinegar vinegar correct yeah
it also good with apple cider vinegar
all the tops yeah brown sugar 
sugar good black pepper a good  
amount of black pepper okay usually we use peppercorn
yeah! he is right who use Habanero
Habanero has a different taste
Yeah. use Filipino chili
ahh I forgot the name of our chili!!
labuyo, yeah it is Labuyo chili. The small one
it depends on you! you can marinate it or you can also cook it direct
it's up to you where you want to cook your adobo
even in cheap or in expensive frying pan it is okey
wait, that is how I make my adobo
I fry first the chicken because it is much more flavorful when you fry it
especially pork, sometimes I fried it because I like it when
SINAGKUTSA
its like you fry it on it's own fat
and it is much more flavorful
a dish look at all that look at that 
crust in the bottom of the pan and  
you want to keep that stuff it 
was beautiful about that skin  
it creates like a flavor protector an 
insulator so to this fat you keep here
they keep talking and he keep ignoring why 
did that are they still getting paid by  
Food Network to be ignored but Uncle Roger 
is still married to ex-wife Auntie Helen
isolator so to this this fat you keep here 
some onion no traditional adobo no onion okay
its okey with onions, me when I cook I put many onion as well
use the right amount, not the white amount 
for Asian cooking garlic is like money it's 
never enough just putting five seconds left  
don't tease us with your five little slice 
of garlic the sky treating garlic truffles
it doesn't have to get very Brown because 
this is going to simmer for about 30 minutes
allow all the caramelized bits stuck to the  
bottom to release so deglazing just 
been using liquid to clean the pan  
you can just say that no need to show off with 
your time life too short for this the cotton  
blue cooking school [ __ ] declares does this 
guy also say he's deglazing his toilet instead
by deglazing okay
important Filipino cooking bay leaf correct yeah
I put two or three sometimes
not enough bay leaves so simple and 
you can make this and basically start  
to finish about 45 minutes but 
after you get this actually is
back menu uncle Roger need to get 
these people to come to my comedy show  
I have rice warm white rice 
with no seasoning very important
even here
plain rice rice look okay 
yeah the habanero is in there
oh it looked okay parsley
personally into Filipino she's 
so upset I put my legs parsley  
don't belong in Asian food you're not making pasta
I want to put cilantro or sprinkles yeah so he  
go oh this parsley also small 
green leaf type nobody noticed
parsley I was always served for me with lemon

through oh look at that too watery no yeah
