in today's episode my nephew and his 
girlfriend will try bicol express
based on your recommendations i'm using one 
sobrang maanghang na red sili as well as green  
sili for nice coloring we will start with the 
baboy 2.5 kilos of baboy goes in without mantika
we'll add a little bit of paminta
Pogi! don't eat baboy naman! now that the baboy 
is getting konting crispy let us add bagoong  
two tablespoons of bagoong i love bagoong 
this will make it even smell better
sarap naman at this stage let us add the bawang 
okay i'm gonna add the bawang now sibuyas
let's mix that a little bit and then we will 
add the gata look at that so i have one liter of  
gata here whole can yes one liter because 
it's uh about 2.5 kilos of baboy okay  
so we're gonna add this and i am so curious to 
their reaction what about you i don't know how  
they will react to this filipino dish for today's 
recipe i'm also adding one tablespoon of sugar  
and i'm gonna add the sili already so 
that it can develop can get more spicy  
give it a stir and cover it now that the gata 
is getting thicker let us add the green sili's
of course i love this dish 
from the philippines but  
let's see their filipino food reaction of course
hello
