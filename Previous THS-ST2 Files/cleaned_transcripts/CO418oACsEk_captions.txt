- Hi, I'm Beryl.
And the theme for today's
video is Street Food Royalty,
and this topic came
highly, highly requested.
Before we get into that,
I wanna tell you about the artist today.
Her name is Sophie Powell.
She is an illustrator based out of London.
She draws food.
So of course, I thought that
she was a perfect addition
to the channel.
So perfect in fact, that she is the artist
for this month postcard club
through my Patreon,
it's a great way to support artists
and support me and my channel.
Okay, let's get out of my living room.
(claps)
Welcome to Siargao Island,
a small island in the Philippine sea,
known as the surfing
capital of the Philippines.
(gentle music)
To say this place has beach town vibes
would be the understatement
of the century.
We are here to learn about kwek kwek.
But many of you might be asking,
what exactly is kwek kwek?
So I asked some of you to help us out.
- Kwek kwek is one of the
most famous street foods
here in Philippines.
- It's one of those cheap snacks
that you can find almost anywhere.
Plus I guarantee you
almost everyone here knows
and is familiar with the kwek kwek.
- Kwek kwek are boiled quail eggs
- That is coated in savory batter.
The batter is made of flour,
water, and annatto powder
or orange food color.
- And then deep fried.
Yeah.
- And the most important ingredient
is the orange food color.
- It's not kwek kwek if it's not orange.
- I mean, just look at this.
When you see this from afar,
you're like, "Oh, kwek kwek. I want that."
- I think the back story
is they made it orange
because it was appetizing.
- It actually comes into variance.
Here's a small version
made out of quail eggs.
- And the second one is tokneneng.
Just get bigger
because it has chicken egg inside.
- It's actually the dip
that completes the eating experience.
- There's a couple of
different dipping sauces
for kwek kwek.
The first is a thick, sweet syrupy sauce.
And the second one is good old vinegar.
- Made with vinegar, onions, pepper,
and other spices.
- And then we just pop it in our mouth
on our way home.
(upbeat music)
- Go eat your kwek kwek.
- To help me tell this story,
I've hired my good friend Jeremy.
I mean, we've never
actually met (chuckles),
but I've known him for a
really, really long time.
In fact, he was in my documentary I made
when quarantine first started.
There he is with his parents.
Love it.
He's a filmmaker in the
Philippines with his wife.
They have a YouTube channel,
which obviously I'm going to be linking to
if you wanna check it out.
They explore the Philippines.
It's really wonderful.
But I was very excited
that they agreed to
help me tell this story.
- Hello.
Hello, hello.
Testing, audio, audio.
Hey, everyone.
My name is Jeremy Kruis.
I'm a filmmaker here in the Philippines.
Currently I'm in Siargao island
helping Beryl film a story here.
Today, we're gonna check
out a cool spot here
in Siargao called Kanto Ta Par.
They sell a bunch of
different street foods,
including kwek kwek.
But they have a little bit of a twist
to their kwek kwek.
Here they use duck eggs
instead of quail eggs.
So let's see what it tastes like here.
(gentle music)
(bright music)
- It was super cool
filming at Kanto Ta Par.
There's so many people
that love that place.
But I highly recommend you try kwek kwek
if you're in the Philippines,
or you can even try making it at home.
- So I needed to find quail
and duck eggs to make this.
And I know that they don't sell those
at my corner grocery store.
So I went down to New
York City's Chinatown,
where there's a supermarket
called Hong Kong market,
where I know they sell them.
I'm not really sure how many eggs I need.
Let me ask you guys.
On average, when it comes to kwek kwek,
how much can you eat?
- There was an urban legend
that eating two pieces of kwek kwek,
actually reduces your
lifespan by half a day.
Could be partly true,
because of the cholesterol
content of each quail egg.
But I can consume around 20
in one sitting, I would say.
- There was one time where I ate, I think,
10 kwek kweks in one sitting.
- I can probably eat eight to 10.
- Probably like six to eight.
- Maybe eight to 10.
- You know what?
I could do seven on a good day.
But when I'm really craving for it,
I'd say 15.
- So I can eat at least 10 or more,
if I have good companies like friends.
- My record it's bad (chuckles).
I ate like 25 in one sitting.
It was a mess.
- [Beryl] (laughs) Twenty five!
All right, look, I can only
buy the eggs in these packets.
So, let's just see how it goes.
25 though was bold.
Real bold.
All right, we've got it.
And we got some extra stuff.
These chips looks really good.
I will see you back in my kitchen.
(cheers)
Which brings us back to today time.
And I'm now going to make kwek kwek.
(gentle music)
Street food has a special
place in people's hearts
because it's kind of something
that you grow up with.
So I wanted to know how
kwek kwek fit into that.
- Back in high school
they actually sell this
outside the school grounds.
And I would usually eat
kwek kwek on the street.
- [Beryl] Alexa, set a two-minute timer.
- I love eggs in general.
So that's one of the main
reasons why I love it.
And it also gives me flashbacks
of childhood memories.
I used to eat it a lot growing up.
People would sell it on pushcarts,
and I would run after them
and getting myself two
or three or four or five,
and depends on how much
money my parents gave me
when I was younger.
- I've had a lot of good
memories with kwek kwek.
I've taken dates with kwek kwek.
I had very fond memories
when I was in college.
When I couldn't afford a decent meal,
I just eat kwek kwek
because it's already filling on its own.
- When I was in college,
my friends and I always
eat kwek kwek after class.
Because since it's affordable it's...
And it's literally everywhere.
You can eat it while bonding with friends.
So it's really the memories you have
while eating kwek kwek.
(gentle music)
- I like it because it
reminds me of my childhood,
especially the summers.
So back in the province in summer time
when there's no school
we really don't have a lot
of things to do at home.
My parents used to ask us to take a nap,
I don't know, 2:00PM.
And then wake up again at around 4:30.
And that's around the same time
as the vendors would
start roaming the streets
and sell their merchandise.
We would go out,
and my mom or my dad would treat us
to eating some street food.
And that's quite enjoyable
and such a good bonding
activity for the family.
(gentle music)
(laughing)
- What?
This looks amazing.
It's so orange.
It smells like fried dough.
Okay, I'm gonna...
I'm so excited.
I can't believe how good this looks like.
Don't I look like a...
I'm like a one woman street stall here.
"Kwek kwek, come get your kwek kwek".
(chuckles)
I made a sweet and spicy dipping sauce.
Oh, it's thick.
(upbeat music)
Oh my God, that's like
the most satisfying food
I've ever eaten in my entire life.
The quail egg is so soft
and I kind of jammy boiled them,
so they wouldn't be super hard boiled.
And so when you bite into it,
it's like a waffly eggy pillow.
This is my first time having a quail egg.
I like them.
They were a nightmare to peel.
Everything that's terrible
about peeling a chicken egg
is compounded when peeling a quail egg
'cause they're so small.
I broke like two of them
with just the sheer
power of my fingertips.
(grunts)
I love this duck egg.
I guess we'll just do it like this.
Very different flavor.
The duck egg is so much more like gamey.
I've never had a meal
where I eat two different
animal eggs back-to-back.
But here we are.
And the duck egg
is like a lot kind of heavier.
There's a lot more flavor.
The quail egg is so much softer.
I actually kind of feel
like I prefer the quail egg.
Lexi.
My sister's here today.
Lex.
- [Lexi] Yeah?
- You wanna try some kwek kwek?
- [Lexi] Not on film.
- Yeah.
(Lexi mumbles)
(chuckles) She's nervous.
Everyone, give my sister a warm welcome.
They've all given you a warm welcome.
Okay, here you can come sit.
I'll be like right next to you here.
- I'm covered next to you.
- Yeah, okay.
So dip-
- Wow.
- Dip it in the sweet and spicy
- Is it gonna be spicy?
- No, well taste it.
- What am I eating?
- This is a deep fried quail
egg from the Philippines.
- Wow.
- I think she likes it (chuckles).
- Wow.
- Do you like it?
- Mmm.
What other eggs do you have?
- This is a duck egg.
Do you wanna try it?
- I think I like the duck egg.
- I liked the quail egg, wow.
- I think I liked the yolk
in the duck egg better.
It was like more.
- Yeah.
- Definitely yolk is my favorite part.
Let's be real.
- It's not my favorite part.
- Thank you.
(laughing)
- Give her a round of
applause, ladies and gentlemen.
My sister (chuckles).
Well, I think at this point
I've lost like over a week of my life.
Tell me where you guys
would like to go next
and what you would like
to learn about next.
The sponsor money has come through.
So we are primed and ready to fly.
If you're interested in
more videos like these,
I have a couple of
other street food series
that I've done like this.
And check them out.
Tell me what you think.
I'm excited for the next one
and I will see you there.
Bye.
(humming)
