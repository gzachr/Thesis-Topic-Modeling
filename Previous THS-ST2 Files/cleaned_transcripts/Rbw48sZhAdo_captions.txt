 
places where tourists don't go yeah hey guys 
welcome back to another Vlog so after Hong Kong  
we actually made it back to Manila the Philippines 
and today we're on a very special Mission because  
today we're visiting my childhood domestic worker 
she's Filipino and she's located in another  
city and today we're gonna catch a bus to that 
surprise her so this pasay bus stop I think  
it's a rather popular bus stop here and they have 
different routes the one that we're going today is  
to cabanatuan I'm not sure I'm pronouncing 
right correct me if I'm wrong it sounds like  
I'm saying carbonara every time in my impression 
it's a rather rural area so I guess we're going  
back in nature I don't know really so I have 
no expectation at all me too I'm just excited  
all right so I'll pass this here now and everyone 
is trying to get on the bus it's super crowded so  
I think it's a first in first serve kind of 
bus but luckily it's air-con on this one anyway  
oh my goodness
I made on a bus
what a what experience trying to squeezing 
the buses then I think because people the  
more people than sits on the bus that's 
why everyone tried to cook I feel like  
a horse just stand in a horse racing match 
everyone's just like I want the gate is open  
it's okay you can be relaxed because 
I'll go first all right so the bus is  
slowly departing now and if everything goes 
well we'll see you guys in a couple hours
all right thank you uh so I'm gonna send her 
a message first I don't know where she is but  
from what it seems like to be a Rudder it's 
more developed than I thought it would be I  
thought it would be like Countryside kind of 
town but not a 7-Elevens McDonald's all around  
so it's quite convenient it seems like but 
this is not our last destination because her  
house is actually 40 minutes away from natural 
city so we still think they take another ride  
waiting time excited because I haven't seen her 
for a long time we're always call IT cameras in  
cantonese's like sister yeah yeah so because she's 
still working for my auntie so every time when I  
went back and I see her I'll just give her a big 
hug and she'll hug me with so long and won't let  
me go it is so easy to see people on social media 
living their best life and you compare yourself  
with them thinking that they have it all together 
and you don't know what you're doing in your life  
because that's exactly like us behind the scenes 
of our daily production our travel Vlogs we also  
have our own personal struggles sometimes a 
relationship with Alina sometimes with work  
but the point is that's just life it's okay to 
be not okay and that's why I cannot recommend  
online therapy sessions enough which is why I'm 
so excited to tell you about today's video sponsor  
better help better help is the world's largest 
online therapy platform yes it is 100 online how  
it works is you first answer a few questions 
and better help will match with the therapist  
that best meets your needs and expectations 
then you can communicate with them whichever  
way you feel the most comfortable whether it's 
through tax message phone call video call and  
if the therapist you get matched up with don't 
really get along you can always change another  
therapist with no additional costs so if you're 
ready to join over 4 million people taking charge  
of the mental health you can use our Link in the 
description at it's betterhelp.com project where

it's happy happy hello oh nice to 
meet you nice to meet you hello hello  
that's okay I can play fine so yeah 
okay let's go adventure begins yeah  
adventure begins my brother-in-law 
oh okay nice to meet you hello hello
foreign because
um she took care of me for three years when 
I was like a baby so I don't remember much of  
it but anyway now we arrive at the next 
destination which is SM caberneton City  
mall and she tried it and then after that 
I immediately told her oh it's Nick and she  
stopped put down so we're talking about so 
they actually watched our Hong Kong episode  
yesterday and we're just talking about how 
our snake soup experience when she first  
tried it she thought it was chicken as well 
because my mom went to the last second and  
told her oh it's Nick after she finished the 
whole bowl and she was so surprised yeah I'm  
so surprised what is your favorite dish in Hong 
Kong like what do you like oh I like fried rice  
you can go wrong with fried rice for example I 
don't know the menu at the restaurant so I go  
I I go to fried rice yeah that's what 
they see yeah cannot go wrong that's true
so many people say hi to us today I think it's 
our first time will be first time staying at a  
Filipino household so we're interested to see 
how it's like yeah so you will experience the  
village life no aircon use the mosquito net 
I think you don't use mosquito net experience  
only in Bali or in Thailand in Islands so we 
actually haven't had lunch at all today only  
the cup noodles that we saw just then at a 
bus stop so it's like a smoke up so super  
hungry right now this might just be one of 
our last Lalo we have had in the Philippines
very nice sneak on your food 
cart that's awesome all right  
yeah I guess for two portions 
anyway yeah what do you want
it's a very sweet drink in 
the Philippines I thought it  
was Coca-Cola but it's not tense as a 
Filipino drink so let's give it a shot  
so according to what um Carmen 
said inside has pandan vanilla
right so it's a childhood drink of yours 
yeah okay all right give a try the taste  
is similar but the traditional 
one when I was younger tastes more
like more watery right and just the hint of 
vanilla and the hint of sugar yeah it's more  
better because this one is more water is it 
yeah it's more watery yeah to be honest after  
Hong Kong it's been a while since we've had 
Filipino food so I'm missing sunigang a little  
bit so that's why we ordered a special sinigang 
the with darkness which is like a crispy pork  
kind of thing to my knowledge that's something 
we had in Boracay before only for 178 pesos yeah
a little bit cheaper actually and also 
ordered another synagogue which is the  
salmon head right there and we're going 
another Senegal and katakare over there
yeah looks good so this is sinigang this is yeah
it's gonna be a very sour meal 
dinner perfect in the Philippines
now the fruit was really delicious it caught 
my surprise to be honest the city gang was  
super sour just like how we like it but now we're 
getting to the next dish which is the Halo Halo  
and apparently Ian is dropping more of those one 
place that's very famous where halahala is called  
raisin yes all right so we ordered some Halo Halo 
from this place called razon not raisin just say  
I present right but uh yeah the Halo Halo here 
looks very different to the one from like Chow  
King or Marina so it's more brown in color usually 
the ones that fast where they're more colorful  
try my best not too sweet because 
it's too sweet the hello hello it's  
like I cannot taste the coldness all 
I taste is sweet so I like just right  
this one's more milky I would say yeah 
yeah more milky I agree it's more maybe
it tastes like more like a milkshake than 
Halo Halo yeah it's so different this one  
okay so after around 40 minutes 
drive we have finally arrived  
the place so this is gonna be the 
start of our Province Adventure okay
home sweet home yeah
wow
I hear baby
eyes cat oh you [ __ ] it's amazing
what's his name Raymond
that's so nice so hot
you're just like this so this is the 
province life this is a bathroom and  
Cameron said there is actually no shower 
here so you just gotta use the bucket
and also she told me it's just cold shower 
here no hot water here can you live like this  
I think I'm okay I'm okay I've always done that 
I think I'm fan of hot water the water for you  
yeah all right let's check out our room
we take down the aircon because it's too old
right
everything is wood here
house is older yeah right
okay so you have towel there and we 
put the skin on it oh perfect but I  
think if we set up the mosquito Nets here 
it's my first time setting it up as well  
so hopefully you can keep the mosquitoes out 
because we haven't got mosquito sprays today
Alina is looking forward to it I think 
I have idea to buy some mosquito spray  
but unfortunately it's close already 
so yeah but I think that's just the  
province live I guess I'm ready to brush 
teeth yep gonna brush teeth Outdoors here  
we always take from some hustles like this 
yep brush into face so now we have examples
hi hello okay now time is 2158 and we already 
already gonna go to sleep because today a long  
day and see it's like this the mosquito 
net and also according Province like  
people wake up early here so let's go to 
sleep earlier so probably we'll wake up
like this okay let's see how night is going 
and see you tomorrow morning all right  
good morning guys so welcome to day 
two here in the province live and I'm  
not too sure how my hair looks like but 
probably really messy but uh yeah good  
thing about last night no actually 
last night we didn't sleep too well  
like a zombie yeah so we're a bit jelly at 
the moment um yeah at 5 00 a.m chicken stuff
um let's go in see um I think they woke 
up really early I think people in this  
area usually they work about five or six a.m so 
really early all right let's see where they are
getting out of the back
oh good morning hello good morning
hello now it's daytime Frank can finally see 
his color last night I cannot see nothing  
yeah it's a beautiful
Filipino dogs eat rice as 
well you look so happy oh
right so this is the province type of car 
the tractor yeah right it's my first time  
getting one I think so we've got the motor 
the engineer and then it's pulling the tractor
Cameron super like a like it's like 
tricycle but a tractor pulling it
so interesting to see how he drives 
it's like lifting it up like this
hello wow my daughter also worked in 
Hong Kong before oh wow that's awesome
I prepared this for you wow 
that's very nice of you thank you
wow thank you wow suspicious 
it's nice you our place  
yeah definitely a different side of 
Philippines yeah I think yeah this  
is our first time in a Filipino 
household so yes very interesting
that's video
this is the first time we have a visitor 
just like you a foreigner first time first  
time ever yeah let's do selfie like 
this yeah let's do another selfie
usually are there foreigners that come here 
yes not a lot um right all right so everyone  
now is hopping on tractor and we're gonna 
do a family picnic near the farmer later  
it's like a family gathering here so a 
lot of rice fields surrounding us here  
it's baked beautifully just love the 
greenery when it compares to the city
foreign
here and I've got a small Hut over there and 
they told me some stories how when uh when they  
were young they would swim over in this canal 
when there is still water but now not anymore  
but yeah this is uh nature 
Province life of Philippines
wow wow let's go let's go one experience 
laughs so we've got a mini picnic here  
in salheart yeah got some tea prepare 
for us as well wow thank you so much
yeah we said that we drink tea in 
the morning we can drink coffee yeah
Canadian tea wow and especially because it rained 
yesterday so you can smell the smell of rain and  
the grass here it's very fresh so nice oh and 
a special fruit I'm gonna try it first time  
then the only regret I have was not wearing 
my drone you don't bring me a drop yeah that's  
the only regret I have it's so beautiful here I 
should have brought my drone showing the mountain  
backdrops The Greener is here so beautiful 
and then this one is Okay so we've got some  
long and Lisa here so this side is the park with 
garlic and this one is the longones that will beef  
with honey I love honey I can see it's 
reflective in a Filipino breakfast  
sometimes consistent of rice yeah always 
rise actually not sometimes as always
yeah
usually in the morning it feels like one 
of those like Western dining like the the  
when they serve the appetizers the the bread 
that have bread but it's a Filipino bread  
this one masara yeah it's been a while since 
I've used this term to Masala do you know this  
uh this one no this one is first time trying 
sour fruit and this one is not balut right
so we've got two karaoke of different 
food here this is like is this like  
proper Filipino breakfast yeah 
with egg with sausages of rice  
I think that's what I see on the main 
sometimes this is the cheese buns okay
not really nothing spread you don't need to add  
butter because it feels very it 
has a buttery taste already yeah
all right so this is their 
local food this one vivano
got some seeds inside yeah Filipino fruit I 
don't even know how to eat it to be honesters
it's like just melts in your mouth that kind 
of meat text yeah yeah but soft I remember it's  
right and it reminds me to Pineapple this 
is Justin yeah she was telling me it fell  
out the night before we came it's like a sign 
that we're coming oh my gosh don't fall down
luckily it survives
so time flies I think that was a really 
good hour spending some time out here in  
the rice field it was really relaxing 
and just spending time with this new  
Filipino family and it was so nice taking 
photos together just then it was just too  
bad today the clouds a little bit cloudy 
it looks very dramatic if on a sunny day  
I think it's beautiful beautiful anyway 
I think we are on way back now up there
people die
so from where I'm here I hear all the family 
members are just around so like the house  
behind us their families as well the one behind 
his family as well as a whole series family so  
whenever there's big festivals like Christmas you 
just come house by house by house or just hang out  
in the streets and in a province it's more I guess 
like more freedom as well and yeah it's like all  
Village it's family everything everyone know each 
other like big Community yeah it's so interesting  
just like when we're driving past everyone's 
just holding hello to each other you know this  
morning when I wake up I see the cat it's so cute 
just sleeping on a sofa on a chair right there
cat likes a lot of attention
so now we get it in front of Cameron's house and 
all the family relatives they all come over here  
and just say we just had a really good decent 
conversation getting to know everyone but it's  
a rather big family you can see everyone's 
just sitting at the back at the roof and oh  
let's see yeah we stay here outside do 
you understand okay yeah why not okay
why not
do you want how long to 
drive oh one and a half hours
two hours whoa so now we're actually going to 
the beach which is two hours away from here  
what is your name Kylie okay that's a good 
name it's a beautiful name yeah and you're  
so beautiful too we need more space this 
is the ultimate Filipino family experience  
oh everyone packed in one car wait 
one two three four five six seven
eight nine ten eleven eleven people in one 
car so we're currently halfway to the beach  
cutting and we actually had breakfast not 
long ago but now we're getting lunch again
all right let's continue our journey to the beach
foreign
eventually they gave up so now we've made a 
quick pit stop so we have arrived the area of  
our final destination the beach this area is 
called England district and that's where the  
beach is and we're just making a quick pit stop 
here so you can see there's some vendors behind  
us and opposite to us there there's some 
cows oh look at them aren't they beautiful  
just peacefully money knowing business oh and on 
the other hand there there's some ducks and also  
that's the longest mountain in the Philippines and 
you can see the clouds actually rolling in right  
now rainy season the sky is very unpredictable 
I wanna stay in the mountains more yeah  
it is really nice are you a 
team mountain or Team Beach
this man's a professional oh
it's real fast who needs a drone when 
we've got this man oh look at him
all right the hand oh hey looks really 
pretty good actually so many goats
all right so our first stop of this dingling 
road trip is this Viewpoint yeah I think it's  
called the Pacific Viewpoint so we're in 
this area called politic and common Sun  
Henley actually has two local friends here and 
they're gonna take us around basically this place
thank you so after the bit of work 
we've arrived the Viewpoint here  
and the view from here it's absolutely 
spectacular look they're building some  
sort of like wooden ceilings 
right off the cliff foreign
y I'm not even sure if you guys can hear us but  
strong wind but a view was worth it the walk was 
worth it the journey just said was worth it too
easy yeah
so after around 30 minutes I was the exact drive 
just saying just along the cliff actually we saw  
some Landslide maybe because of the rain this 
early morning so it's a little bit dangerous  
but nevertheless we have arrived the next 
destination today which is the beach area it's  
called Pacific Bay and this one right here it's 
black sand beach it's probably the second black  
sand beach I've seen in my life the first one 
is in Korea in an area called goje but this is  
Philippines black sand beach and to be 
fair if you look closer these are not  
actually scents these are like small rocks Pebbles
so refreshing come it's so refreshing the 
water so refreshing yeah and I think this  
is actually a resort this one right 
here so you can probably stay here
so the send actually is not sand these 
are Pebbles Pebbles quality looks so nice  
they're just tiny rocks basically so there's 
some big ones and some small ones as well  
yeah it's like Jelly Bean in a package
foreign
trip we actually went for dinner just now and 
we had a very simple dinner it's like a noodle  
dish with thick soup and then one noodle for 
50 pesos or 50 peso and it was quite nice as  
well and the whole family took a big bowl of 
them and yeah they couldn't finish it so I  
had to take them away but anyway I hope you 
guys have enjoyed this Vlog so far and yeah  
to be honest it's caught me by surprise going
