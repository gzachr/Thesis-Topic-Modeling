hello you beautiful Psynners welcome 
back to the channel my name is Psynergic  
and today we're reacting to pablo question mark  
you guys i didn't know this came out it came out 
what six days ago almost a week um i didn't hear  
about it or anything um you guys mentioned it 
in a comment i was like okay i'll listen to it  
i like listening to things it's kind of what i do 
here it has almost 200 000 views and it literally  
there is not a whole lot of tags like as far 
as like an seo standpoint he didn't really do  
anything for for to be that discoverable you guys 
already just like saw it like shared it apparently  
like the seo score overall is like 25 out of 100 
it's 25 that is not just a failing grade that  
is like failing so the fact that you guys have 
already seen it almost 200 000 of you have seen  
it to include me now soon is pretty awesome shows 
your uh so it shows your love for the guy as you  
should as we all should i'm excited to check this 
out um i'm not gonna go far into this i don't know  
what this is going to entail it might require me 
to do a bigger deeper deeper dig into the lyrics  
but so far like it looks like it could be deep i'm 
just not sure how to it's only three minutes so  
let's see what we can get into here if you guys 
don't know me i am a reactor i do bls i do music  
i also have a master's degree in clinical 
psychology and so whenever a video might touch  
on a subject related to mental health that's kind 
of what i do i talk about mental health in regards  
to these videos so if this one does we won't be 
talking about mental health without further dudes  
let's go okay pablo tell us the story weave it 
for us i don't know what significance this has  
it's like 1 20 20 22 so january 20th 2022 which 
would have been in the future by the way that  
would have been three days after this video 
released and it's at 8pm i feel like numbers  
have a significance with these guys always so 
let me know what that actually means for you all
oh it's also glitching so it definitely has 
a meaning they're drawing your attention in  
i think it's the 20th it might be the 28th
oh
okay okay
oh
love the raspiness in his voice
this is highly emotional
um
get it king
all right okay tell us about 
it this is getting me emotional
tell us about it
whoo okay king this one was deep yeah this one was 
deep i think this is the first one that that i've  
reacted to with straight uh well i mean this is 
not strictly speaking sb19 because this is pablo  
but out of all of the sp 19 songs i would say that 
this one has probably as far as the mental health  
side of things has the deepest the deepest and and 
probably at least in my opinion probably shows the  
the most vulnerability thus far i'm still 
new to them so please don't you know  
don't come for me babes but uh but you know it's 
very much a possibility um that this at least in  
my opinion the ones that i've seen thus far this 
has the deepest meaning i would say at least as  
far as mental health as far as mental health 
is concerned i think i'm actually going to go  
into these i think a little bit there are some 
clear things that i think we want to talk about  
thank you pablo for making this an english 
translation so that i could actually have a  
conversation about this i really appreciate that 
you definitely don't have to do that and i don't  
ever want anybody to think that they have to um 
i am not that person but whenever somebody does  
that i am very appreciative of it because it 
gives me a chance to talk about these things  
so let's talk about it uh we're gonna skip ahead 
a little bit here i actually really like how long  
we sat here we sat here for looks like like 
40 seconds waiting for something to happen  
right and we saw his glitches and everything 
this is very clearly a very sad emotional  
song and it speaks to an emotional turmoil i think 
that's what he's trying to get across here and i  
think that's maybe like i'm not gonna say that 
that's what he's going through but because that  
that would be inappropriate like it could just be 
he went through it and now he's talking about it  
it could be something he's currently going through 
either way there's a lot to talk about here
so right here just without even having said a 
word yet like we're looking like i don't know  
the significance of this time i'm sure you guys 
will come up with something and let me know but  
i don't know the significance um is that an eight 
or is it a zero i don't know either way it's an  
eight it has to be an eight because friday so 
it is it's still in the future it's not the 20th  
this came out on the 17th it's still in the future 
it's just a little bit further in the future than  
i originally anticipated um so it's this coming 
friday so something's coming up this friday  
at 8 pm i'm assuming philippine time which would 
be 6 a.m my time that's my guess that's my guess  
i mean like i said without even saying a word 
like one this is telling us that something's  
gonna happen on this date at this time 
second it's probably like i don't know  
his solo album maybe i don't know a song 
a solo song i'm not sure you guys would  
have a better idea than i would but even 
then like this is already speaking volumes  
the instrument that's playing the mood the 
lighting that's being portrayed here and then  
when he walks out with his hood up for me a hood 
is the most comforting thing in the world when i'm  
sad when i'm upset when i'm sick already to me 
that's speaking volumes i love a hoodie there's  
a reason why i love a hoodie because whenever i'm 
feeling down hoodies make me feel very comfortable  
it makes me kind of i don't know like it brings 
the world into focus maybe a little bit more  
because i can't see everything maybe that's it or 
it could just be because it's warm i don't know
dark room
signals dwelling on my memories of regrets when we 
talk about uh some of these kind of so there are  
different ways in in psychology especially therapy 
depending on who you talk to most of us would say  
that you're on we're on the third wave right now 
and that's using a cognitive behavioral therapy uh  
like a step further because that's like a 
second wave third wave is more of that um  
dbt these these newer age forms of therapy which 
take into account like mindfulness and so when we  
think about mindfulness mindfulness is being in 
the present moment we can see with already the  
what he's talking about here he's talking 
about regrets memories that's you know past  
tense stuff that's things in the past and what 
type what typically you find in in things like  
uh sadness in in depression not saying that he's 
depressed is not a diagnosis or anything like that  
we're just having a conversation but whenever we 
talk about depression typically those individuals  
are are kind of remembering things whereas 
anxiety is more about the future you're thinking  
about the future depression sadness typically 
lives in the past and so that makes sense you  
know he's talking about the regrets the memories 
memories of regrets and it's already kind of sad
yeah when we're talking about you know these 
these young men being in the position that they  
are when you're in a young when you're young and 
i know that these guys are a little bit older now  
but having worked so hard towards one goal when 
you are younger and finally achieving that goal  
pretty still pretty young it becomes uh what 
next kind of deal and to a certain extent  
those early to late teens are when we try to 
figure out who we are once that happens once we  
like maybe achieve our dreams at a young 
age like it then becomes uh what now or who  
am i now you know i'm very small time 
compared to these guys very like minut  
it's time like like minutiae time compared 
to these guys but it does to a certain extent  
sometimes leave you wondering who you are because 
you're like for example i'm on the camera a lot  
and and although synergic is a part of me i 
am synergic me synergic is not always sean i  
tend to say that synergic is a little bit more 
energetic and outgoing whereas sean is a little  
bit more of a homebody and more internal um you 
know it becomes a matter of like who am i who am  
i really am i this person on the camera am i this 
person in front of everybody or am i am i this  
other guy that that is that internalizing person 
i am fortunate that i'm a little bit older than  
these guys a little bit i've had that opportunity 
to kind of figure out who i am for the most part  
i've had my own identity crisis because of 
events in my life but not something of this scale  
tell us about it tell us about it
no i think we care
you have a lot of people who care king a 
lot of people i just want to give them a hug
it's interesting that he used the 
moon here because the moon is a  
has been used throughout history to to signify a 
couple of things right it's the end of a day it  
signifies the end of stuff but it also signifies 
night which is oftentimes dark which is dark  
and sometimes you know if if somebody has 
depression it can kind of feel like that's  
the hardest point for people that that can be one 
of the hardest times for a lot of people you know  
that darkness i mean so we're see yet again saying 
are you my friend moon are you my friend or you  
just bring misery into my life um and so i think 
that that's that's has a pretty significant role  
to play as far as imagery is concerned in this 
song so far i really like it i really like that
highly emotional
so let's say that you know this plane right 
here is uh the normal everyday kind of feeling  
depression would be a dip in that right being 
sad is a dip but being depressed is a big dip  
and then we of course have the opposite 
right that bipolar nature that manic  
aspect of things and that's you know that's 
the opposite a bipolar person would go  
down and up and down and up whereas the depressed 
person might go normal down back into normal down  
and back into normal that kind of pattern now with 
depression in particular once you're depressed one  
time you're more likely to be depressed a second 
time if you become depressed a second time your  
chances of being depressed a third time increase 
even more and so it's it's a cycle and you often  
hear people talk about that cycle as clinicians 
our job and what we want to try and do is to try  
and break that cycle the best we can give you 
the tools to try and combat that cycle and so  
when he's talking about the night here he's 
talking about the moon he's talking about  
the day night cycle which also kind of makes 
me think of of this cycle as well that this  
depression cycle that's that's that's the 
first thing that comes to my mind anyways
i love the effect he put on here 
it's really good that vhs effect  
a highly emotional spot  
the moon also brings that little 
bit of light though too right  
so you gotta be at least thankful a little bit
great effect guys well done artistically well done
this is really good god i want 
to give him a hug right now
this is really well done i could feel the 
emotionality in it and i could feel the sadness  
in that song the performance was well done i don't 
know if he wrote it yeah clearly he didn't really  
put anything on on this as i mentioned that's all 
the information i have and all i can do is is kind  
of go off of what is being said i don't know if he 
wrote it i don't know if he's feeling that i don't  
i can't give any good indication otherwise i can 
tell you that artistically this video is well done  
and there's a lot of symbology there and i like it 
as far as a mental health professional's point of  
view it all makes sense it sounds like somebody 
who knows a little bit of of what it feels like  
i you know it could have been somebody else 
who wrote it and he could just be performing  
it so never take like this is the first 
time i think i've done this with an sb19  
even if it's not necessarily sp 19's pablo who is 
in sb19 i've never done lyric breakdowns with you  
guys yet because quite frankly there haven't been 
any real like not that they're not good songs but  
they're not like there's nothing for me to talk 
about as far as a mental health there's plenty  
of me to talk about as a fan but as far as a 
mental health professional is concerned like  
this is the first time i've been able to really do 
that with an sb 19 song and so i'm i'm glad that  
this this is here i've so badly wanted to to dig 
in deeper to some of these and here it is here it  
is thank you i don't remember who suggested this 
but thank you to that person seriously thank you  
to that person because i would have not found this 
on my own it would not have popped up even though  
i was subscribed to pablo i think if you have 
any more suggestions like this a little bit more  
emotionality uh something that i can talk about as 
a mental health professional i would love to talk  
about it comment down below your suggestions let's 
have a conversation down there as well tell me  
your own thoughts about that about this video 
about the symbology you guys have better insight  
into the members that i do because i'm still 
learning i'm still new to all of this quite  
frankly let's chat down in the comments hit that 
like button hit that subscribe button for more  
content like this let's have those conversations 
let's break the stigma have the conversations  
guys thank you so much for being here do take 
care be safe out there wash your hands tell  
your loved ones that you love them wear your 
masks and i will see you in the next video bye
do
