hello guys what up people welcome to the new 
episode in the Philippines I'm Justin I'm  
Alina and today amazing weather yes today amazing 
weather that's why no it's not related but we're  
making sinigang today so now we're heading 
to our favourite Market landmark and today we  
actually have a friend joining us as well and our 
friend is called Joy yeah and she is actually a  
Filipina and she can speak Russian as well yeah 
because her husband is Russia they come with me  
and it's really crazy later we will introduce her 
to you guys especially because her son Alina told  
me like some little thing the girl actually 
message me in Russian I was like whoa really  
and we hanged out with her last time at Chinatown 
I'm not sure if you guys remember her but I will  
guys show you guys uh so she will be teaching 
us how to cook yeah I'm so excited this is my  
favorite dish in Italian yeah my favorite soup in 
the world pretty much who would have thought like  
a sour soup would be something that I like 
to know why anyway now we're heading to the  
market we might need to grab a cup of coffee 
first because we're still a bit half asleep I  
think well let's have a go to the market and grab 
a cup of coffee and then we go shopping okay okay
[Music]
I saw the video so this is Joyce and 
uh she will be our teacher today yeah  
do you want to say hi to our audience say 
something in Filipino language [Laughter]
[Laughter] okay let's grab 
our ingredients then yeah okay
what kind of vegetables
yeah so not really any but usually 
it's this radish but they check  
the price oh I love radish this is the 
cheapest wow how much how many we need  
only this is already too much it's okay 
for three of us because we will put  
other vegetables as well okay your radish and 
then we call Chinese spinach kampong oh yeah
[Laughter] okay right
I don't know about this veggie yeah me too maybe 
today we learned something new about like Filipino  
veggie let's buy ingredients and later we will 
show you guys what we grab in this market okay  
British
[Music]  
all right so the music stopped now so now I can 
finally Vlog hot music's back oh no um we're  
gonna grab many ingredients um so this is what is 
this chord again string beans right and we've got  
Kang Kong here it's a plane just then and we've 
got the sinigang powder as uh Joy actually said  
for pork it's better to use like towel flavored 
cinnigans but if um it's like seafood then there  
is another pack for this as well guppy 
isn't it like good night or something yes
oh I see I see it what is the 
difference in stress Gabby and Gabby
you know I'm a king of sauces what kind of fish 
it is no just fish sauce usually for fried rice  
and also we grab this is pork belly and some 
beef yeah because I know for sinigang usually  
we people use pork belly but for us I know when 
we go to restaurants we like to eat the meat and  
that's how I got some extra chunks of meat that we 
can like actually eat later uh do you have sesame  
oil oh we just went out yeah we can buy small 
because for example this is swimming beans yeah  
um the way I cook usually I cook um two types 
of dishes for example I have this maybe I can  
use half of it and then half will be like stir 
fries oh okay yeah right yeah for another meal  
oh together with veggie yes I think we can 
buy sesame oil like big [ __ ] because Justin  
always need it I always use it yeah yeah I 
can yeah something like this would be nice  
oh yeah they've got two awesome this this one 
no uh oh yeah this is me oil this is macaroni  
this one then and this comes with two packs that's 
good what else let's do a scene of happy shopping
again again [Music] okay and this one Chili 
Pepper I don't like it but we need it for  
cinegun yeah it is what it is I think uh yeah 
sometimes we don't like it like say like onions  
I don't like it but sometimes it does give out 
the flavor that the dish additionally needs yeah
you need coconut too [Music] foreign
[Music]
is not something common in your country I don't 
know what is this I even do no taste the Marine  
it's like a sour
pad in this package it's already 
powdered but it's really a fruit [Music]
um it's better to cook using the real Tamarind 
or something yeah I think so yeah but I think we  
can use it later better to use this because 
it's fast and um The Taste is like when you  
put it it's immediately sinigang but this 
one you need to boil it for five minutes  
and then when it's soft you just use pork 
pork to mash it yeah but you need this okay
and we're gonna bring us home and I'll 
see you guys at home all right let's go  
all right so we're back at home now we've 
got these ingredients on the table so we're  
gonna go for it in Greens one by one just 
to tell you what we've got so it's that way  
for that one first okay first what do 
you need for cooking it's uh eggplants  
yes green pepper also we need this is 
radish and tomato uh we take some like  
um Filipino Tomatoes like many here but usually 
we need red for soup and one thing that we noticed  
tomatoes in the Philippines is that usually I 
think it's very different taste compared to other  
countries Tomatoes but uh I think uh Tomatoes 
this time we're just gonna use for soup so it  
doesn't actually have to eat tomatoes so it's okay 
the flavor is going to be the ensued yeah anyway
most important part it's a powder yeah 
yeah powder beef guppy and Guppies yeah
yeah it's better next we just 
got onions three onions is it  
Luke is it yeah the Filipino Horoscope oh yes
and uh fish sauce yeah fish sauce yeah awesome 
we've got sesame oil over here so later and we've  
got ping ping Kong Kong and now we've got the sit 
Tau here which is beans string beans yeah I don't  
think I've actually had this before usually 
eat this in Senegal remember I remember yeah  
okay maybe yeah and this is this is we've got two 
cups of meat yeah this is more beef and this is  
pork belly yeah okay so let's start cooking let's 
start cooking I'm so hungry already and apparently  
sunigan's gonna take an hour and a half so it's 
going to take a while so maybe I should eat  
okay anyways to remember how to cook okay 
and I'm not just like um random ingredients  
so you have you have the main the main 
sauce the meat and then the vegetables  
okay and actually so this is the vegetable and 
this one is actually for sauce only we won't use  
this yet okay we have three parts right so easy 
to remember okay reveal again I'm a bit goldfish  
so this one is for the soup the flavors yeah 
this one it's meat meat yeah and then this is  
this will be like our base okay I see and then 
the underneath and then the vegetables because  
vegetable you just only put it when it's done 
except for Taro because Taro is really hard uh  
CSC I actually don't know how to cook tarot 
so I don't know how we're gonna cut it so be  
our teacher today yeah all right how are we 
gonna do this we'll get started first uh but  
the onions tomatoes and then we can free boil 
for the the meat yeah remove the the impurities  
before yeah okay yeah let's do it so let's 
pour the water first and cut the ingredients  
how many days can this super last for yeah maybe 
two days okay well it's actually one day she  
doesn't eat a lot usually Elena put like four 
chicken or something but it's open one chicken  
though so one big chicken fill it she kind of 
four slices but then when she cooked four we  
expect to cook for like even nowadays or anywhere 
you know yeah in Russian style we always like try  
to save food for next few days for all family but 
investing eat all of them but that's the same food
you know I think in Russia earlier told me they 
would normally eat this portion is like like this  
not a lot yeah they're like this besides like 
an hour this is actually because in Russia you  
have soup and you have salad you have soup and 
you have rice as well or something or you can  
eat right so it's three parts yeah yeah so 
you don't have to eat all of it because it  
you have like in for example in Indonesian 
Korean Japanese like you have small parts  
and you are ready the entree what do you call 
that the the Korean stuff has stopped it is
me and my mom what family this is one dish size  
and another dish decides it's 
a pretty dishes like this WOW
normal size okay yeah that's normal 
size wait okay watch the ingredients  
first like this oh we need rides as well yesterday
rice yeah
even even soup because it rise well yes unlike 
in Russia when you have soup on the soup yeah  
because you put making potato inside yeah 
yeah so that's why it's so filming yeah  
yeah we usually use potato for everything 
yeah but the thing here is that date my  
Filipino friends and Russian friends they said the 
potato in Philippines and Russia is very different  
in Russia is very flavorful maybe because of the 
soil I don't know I don't feel different between  
potatoes now different with rice because 
here potatoes crazy it's very expensive  
maybe they are but just don't yeah I'm like 
we don't have like a potato salad I mean  
we normally cook it during community meet their 
celebration right let's see let's see I cooked  
two bowls of rice this time two cups of rice 
because yesterday I finished one about myself
it's okay we eat a lot here okay 
how do I need to cut onions [Music]  
maybe you know I read the other day then on the 
internet they say if you cut cut this thing here  
then you start crying but if you don't cut 
this apart yeah let's go to the end yeah
like this
and do you guys wash rice before you cook 
patient I need to wash rice yes and you use  
like a finger to measure water yeah you know 
they say yeah like fresh joints is how much  
you need to add water so it's like I don't know 
if you guys want to watch a channel but Uncle  
Roger uh there's this Asian guy who rants about 
everything basically he said joint first joint  
that's how much water you need okay let's talk 
from Justin today's finger finger up okay yeah
so you can have the onions [Music]
it's so funny because originally we tried to buy 
uh buy a whole pack of rice and then some of the  
mixtape the target government sells another pack 
of rice is like oh that's gonna last us for a year
where was that uh it was Christmas oh really 
yeah now we have a lot of rice yeah one year  
I guess I think you'll last longer than one 
year so if anyone wants a whole pack of rice
now for you it's maybe it's a in a more done but 
for Filipinos I remember for a family of seven the  
whole soccer price which is 50 kilos it's for 
one month only wow I can imagine I guess last  
time I had Pluto's five and there was so much rice 
rice more than ingredients so I can imagine like  
if that is for free people last time so much 
rice how often do you eat like food of spice  
um less actually really why uh is it because of 
a small island it's an island thing no not really  
it's because I haven't been in a larger group 
since pandemic usually for a larger group right  
yeah I had this for like team building yeah so 
interesting experience it's your hands right yeah  
yeah first time in my life eating with 
cancer yeah I know like Indians they do  
that but I never went to India to actually 
eat this so and I saw at mangina so people  
do that too yes and they eat with rice 
more flavors maybe vanilla yeah I saw yeah
sometimes if I really want to eat like a so tasty 
dishes yeah is it tasty delicious yes and I will  
use my hands like I I will excuse myself okay I 
will excuse myself I wash my hands and I will eat  
with hands the blue will understand anyway right 
because yeah I think all Filipino people they like  
using their hands eating most people yeah yeah 
not every time but if they really like um magana  
like they want to eat a lot then they use hand yes 
interesting right and I can imagine if it's like  
sauces and everything sometimes you want to like 
get all the sauce like in your hand I mean imagine  
eating sweet and sour pork Chinese finger looking 
good I think you're looking good I see uh where is  
the garbage we can probably don't have a cabbage 
bin so we're just using plastic bags for now
I saw many people like many Filipino uh YouTube 
YouTube channels they uh they ought to save a  
lot of plastic bags like they grab some from 
supermarkets and they just like store somewhere uh  
in inside Covenant when they open a cabinet or a 
plastic bags fall out it's like me you didn't see  
it back there he was breathing everything there 
yeah I understand yeah Russia usually will like  
use one plastic bag and we put inside many many 
another plastic bag really yeah in every Russian  
house have plastic bag with plastic bags why why 
why people were just like I don't know something  
if you need no it's because the packet or plastic 
in Russia cost like two pesos or five minutes yes
[Music]
I was waiting in in front of the cashier and 
the cashier is looking at me was looking at  
me and I was looking at her because why 
she didn't put my groceries in the bag and  
then cashier is looking at me why are you 
not taking your groceries [Music] foreign
oh wait no they don't because they 
sell checkout in Australia everything  
is self-checked out now perfect yourself yeah
I need to wash the pockets
I thought it's just like to Chuck it in 
to boils I thought I know I mean we still  
we still wash it right yeah I remember 
uh reading comments in in the internet  
they are arguing if need should be washed 
or not because by cooking you you kill the  
germ the bacteria right yeah so see guys 
you always need to wash this to be honest  
we'll never do this yeah we never do 
yes but just need for two bacterias  
I think it's hot hot my family never washed 
beef before sometimes my Mom would wash chicken  
I washed chicken yesterday whenever I was chicken 
and I dried I think chicken is okay yeah you need  
dry and most importantly if it's not soup when 
you cover it or yeah I think that will cover it  
but uh I told you that I took lazy now because I 
use instant pot and I just put everything in there  
yeah so typically cine gang should take a long 
to take longer yeah first time learn how to cook  
sinigang yeah first time learning so I think after 
this experience we can start making it at home and  
maybe try more Filipino dishes exactly comment 
below what we need to cook next and we'll try  
to cook it at home and if you haven't subscribed 
to our Channel now do it now because uh you'll  
be seeing a lot more new Vlogs coming up I'm not 
sure if you guys know already but we're going to  
take easy very soon and also we're going to uh El 
Nido and coron and my family will be coming to the  
Philippines to visit me as well so it's gonna 
be really exciting so cute to be honest yeah
right
and then this is [Music]
nice yes
wow it's like Cantonese in Cantonese they're 
like nine sounds of the same word like all  
this is different oh my gosh you're sorry 
I'm so hungry I feel so so hungry so hungry  
crazy hungry me too this will be my favorite 
thing that because we cook it by ourselves  
because I'm so hungry makes me more hungry 
yeah because it's sour and do you have sour  
soup in Russia as well no we don't have 
we have sweet and sour how about yourself
yeah you cook it for three 
days you cook it once and  
dip for three days yeah and second day and third 
day it's more tasty yeah by the way borsche is a
however when I first cook it and then I let my 
family tried and they said like it tasted like  
bulalo with beetroot wow really yeah yeah beef 
broth and then you just put the the vegetables  
interesting but and I we never tried we 
never travel all right we just care about  
it we we actually tried but I was right simple 
version of her Channel which is something it's  
a little bit different when you try uh 
manual style which we're going to take  
it so which is famous for uh yeah Russian watch 
so many if you guys didn't try I recommend you  
usually when I saw like everything everywhere 
after I cook my kitchen it's like so dirty  
usually we have a room with Justin if I 
cook just in clean dish if just simple I  
clean dish so usually what do you mean if 
I cook I clean this room I can teach you
[Laughter]
my girlfriend's boyfriend so cut 
the the Guppies Gabby into dices  
and this one yeah so some people just 
use the the knife to cut it this okay
and wait the same one yeah same one 
but other Filipinos they just use this  
oh it's hands I guess yeah [Music] um
it's it's hypnotizing actually 
like yeah some people just do  
it like this dresses yes yeah I like this one
wow so so um how do you call it like 
it's a soothing yeah so relaxing
and when it when it cuts oh [Music]
you put water I mean clean water yeah another 
one another yeah this whole thing is it's like  
cooking Ramen you just like take the impurities 
and it makes like a dirty things for the meat  
and then stick if I throw away all the water and 
then start boiling with the clean mix yeah wow yes  
you don't have to do this that but I think it's 
just personal preference so he would be useful um
okay I think all the veggies are done here and 
what about the the sea towel uh the seatbel we  
can we can use it all but if you want to 
stir fry it it's okay sesame oil oh yeah
until it was good see this 
this is impurities okay oh yeah
all right so as you can see 
the impurities on the side  
okay so we're taking all that out so that 
our soup will be nice and clear later  
and we'll boiling new water to actually 
prepare for the sunigang soup now [Music]  
time in my life when I need like clean the Park 
yeah really yeah yeah um ah wait we don't cooking  
right I see why why is that um because I was born 
in Muslim Republic so we usually don't eat pork  
right I see it Russians many a Muslim you're 
saying yeah interesting I didn't know that my  
mother never eat my mother I don't know it's we 
don't really believe in our traditions we just  
like like a habits we just don't eat but I've seen 
this like many times like you know uh filtering  
out the impurities in every Ramen because I 
really wanted to cook ramen but I know Ramen  
as many steps as well as anything like this but 
it takes maybe over 90 bottles too all right okay
you said my special so cute yes
usually I I do like this okay
okay because we don't have a colander that's 
right yeah we don't have colander maybe we can  
we can cook some of it in stir fry while 
we're waiting yeah sounds good I love dreamy  
after all right a half of it we don't use 
until then it just makes me hungry already
hey how would you cut this oh can 
you do this again yeah but it's  
it's long and it's hard to get there 
remember Cook smart yeah all right I'll do it
so this is we do for Rice stir fry 
stir-fry yeah this is already another dish
snack before the lunch yeah I heard there it's 
like a name for snacks in the Philippines oh  
merienda yeah it's uh what what does that mean 
actually it's like afternoon tea time or it's just  
snack time no it's a in between snap so Filipinos 
usually they um usually they wake up at early  
morning maybe 6 or 70 and yeah and then at 10 A.M 
when six to seven a.m they wake up they do their  
work and at 10 AM they rest under the sea and they 
will have like stress Japan and they have merienda  
the snaps in between and then 12 they will have 
lunch after lunch they will rest a lot of rest  
and they will have marienta again at 3 P.M and 
then um dinner will be like six to seven yeah  
yeah in in Province they do they do that six 
to seven p.m and then they sleep but in modern  
Filipino uh snacks is not not in between but all 
the time any time uh what do you usually stir fry  
those things just garlic garlic salt sometimes we 
add oil to sauce no I mean um meat or veggies yeah  
what what kind of veggies uh so we we do stir-fry 
mix yeah so in this uh Justin's household like  
spinach broccoli bok choy just all kinds of Veggie 
really any veggie you can come over just chop it  
in just put oil and stir fry yeah but we don't 
add sesame oil ah really don't worry we just yeah  
I think sesame oil tastes nice really nice so I 
want to try this is Filipino tomato for 34 peso
how's it supposed
it's really like no taste no you just 
got a fat one then last time okay
apparently affected I liked it looks like 
this big difference some tomato is like  
34 pesos some tomatoes 200. the important 
this is local this is like uh from Baguio  
I know I mean important from other 
countries uh this one is local  
some some our values some are like Low Land 
from different provinces everything's so  
tasty yes fresh Love by you want to go soon 
yeah we're actually going to go about the  
originally for uh [Music] Festival but we just 
missed it we couldn't get we couldn't get a bus
do you eat this row can you eat raw
from now on from now on we cannot talk to Joy
I really loved like yeah Alina introduced 
me to raw garlic it's so spicy though yeah  
Justin never eat raw garlic but in Russia 
we always eat Rosalie it's about immunity  
a leader eats everything raw actually not 
just garlic it's just so brave is it just  
um uh do you eat cabbage as well cabbage yeah 
yeah of course I don't even recoverage like  
this I eat like a Chinese Beijing cabbage 
raw onion too oh yeah yeah I like onions
okay uh we can put the tomatoes onions and 
Gabby and silicone so while we are doing the  
stir fry it's like multitasking okay yeah there 
are there are people who who put their like I  
would say spices yeah like a sequential but I 
do it all the time like everything that's good  
okay you just put everything inside
for myself and onion
um
pork or beef please yeah it is
usually it's boxing again right yes we've 
got me seafood is not coming down uh it's  
it's common as well I've never had secrets in a 
game actually I can imagine it is it because like  
ingredients will be more like expensive that's 
why it's let's go oh it's still pretty common  
it's still still common you have a restaurant here 
for the they have seafood sinigang and fish yeah
yes the most popular type of fish what are 
you doing stir-fry veggie stir-fry veggie  
so first of all we want to put a garlic in 
to get the flavors and have the garlic into  
golden brown and after that uh beans as 
well the sea Tao and after you put rice  
on top of this huh top of 
this rice no no no just ice
oh it's done already so fast yeah so everything 
with rice to go veggie can build soup with rice  
I think it's our first time eating soup with rice 
actually so it's gonna it's very interesting wow  
you always sit in your garden with rice oh yeah 
sure I like it yeah but in the Philippines yeah  
me too first time eat soup with rice when I need 
put rice inside soup or just like mix it yeah I  
remember first time in Mana because it's a little 
bit different it has a bit of sweetness in it if  
you can say add it's Fusion they add watermelon 
inside instead of like a traditional sour agent  
so usually you put rice inside sinigang or you 
just like eat it's like together rice and then  
you put the soup the dish over yeah you put soup 
to Rice like you take spoon rice into soup no so  
you have rice over here and then you have soup 
right and then you put the the soup and then  
the meat and then the vegetables two rice yes 
the rice oh wait did we put put these half of  
them in uh now we're doing for soup yes this 
one's stir-fry often ah but usually usually  
we put rice to soup but we don't put a lot we 
just like take a spoon and eat together okay
it's the preference there's no right or  
wrong answer right okay when do 
you assessing all your titties
like taste this one I hope it's good 
size and it looks like hot sauce
try it's okay you eat everything raw anyway your 
body is used to it no no wait I know what it is
good yeah I know it's wrong
huh yeah this one raw yeah oh my God right
every country is so different
[Laughter]
this one this one see usually in Russia we 
take out this one and we eat this one oh really
let me just give a quick try try 
it tasty it's okay so beautiful
oh it's so good look at this smash the tomatoes
foreign
I wish I could be like this one day but imagine
I can I can yeah
I think that's enough yeah 
Justin also can say like
I was trying to eat it now and then yeah we're 
still dressing like try before like you you give  
me eat and he never tried he just give me it 
like too salty or like too too dry how is it
I had a lot of salt already but still don't 
don't have a lot of taste I think give me  
try give me try yeah you'll be a good judge I 
think I cook for a long time already [Music]
I think I have more salt uh I think I 
added quite a bit of salt because the  
problem about this is you don't know how 
much you're adding I feel like sometimes  
it can be a little bit more what 
kind of sauce is that oh [Laughter]  
I think it's okay anyway anytime we can add salt 
yeah this is uh my mom always make asparagus this  
one yeah and you can put as well oyster sauce I 
think from now on I really just want to buy this  
one in the market now I know how it's called I 
don't know how it's called what's the name of it
sounds so Chinese
no Italian Chinese is head
Ellie knows that I know 
and then wrong this is what  
this is this is um something Egg Eggplant 
yes good job yeah it's fun it looks like um
[Laughter]
you don't know yeah I know I know in Russia 
we usually eat them yeah but in Russia we have  
baklajan this like but so big like this so let's 
go yeah like like this size but it's so small just  
remember that in Philippines everything is smooth 
because our audience still like oh you're gonna  
cook sinigang but you you don't cook so how in 
fact just remove this I don't like worms [Music]  
try again I don't like worms what is this worms 
what is worms worms the vegetable worms here
this one yes it's normal wait wait wait 
where this one yeah [Music] oh [ __ ]
do we need to put it in our in our dish [Music]  
I don't think it's a good idea YouTube this 
oh my God it's normal actually just remove it  
because actually uh eggplant is really prone to 
you you proud of you don't see you oh my God oh my  
God no you should have able to buy this in Russia 
we never have like a warm water inside [Music]  
too scary wait what you should you sure 
can put them in soup yes of course just  
remove the part because in other parts 
it has yeah I guess it's right oh my  
God means that's why I told you don't 
eat vegetable here Raw it's not Russia  
like you you plant it in your backyard 
no it's transported in different places
foreign
[Music]
for example worms for example when I buy 
vegetables because it's from it's from ground  
right we cannot avoid it they they want to eat 
something as well at least they eat nutritious  
food usually they will find in Russia it's 
inside have like this one which means it's wet um
because otherwise spent the one four years yes yes 
that's what India said as well if it's a bad if  
there's form it means it's a good vegan you sure 
you sure but I don't like arms and everything oh  
I thought they just cleave like that you 
know like a potatoes like dots no Chef  
I have for use thereby sit out with garlic 
and sesame oil and salt thank you thank you
leave it here 100 so what I usually 
do I put half of this powder  
in in the soup while it's boiling so 
it will have like Flavor correctly  
and then later because there are uh 
have different ways of cookies yeah
okay now we put this into the soup
we have oh  
only half right yeah why only half and because we 
need to boil this for maybe 30 minutes and half  
will be later first time I see people smell powder 
okay I always try everything right yes [Music]
I see
yeah yeah it's okay I guess 
powder the the tomatoes  
smells good already I feel like this is like very 
similar the process is very similar to many of  
the soup that we make in Asian culture how many 
Saltine just put everything because it will be  
it's very similar to many soup that we make at 
home for example in Russia I know Lena you like  
like making tomato potato soup and in my Hong 
Kong Cantonese culture we use tomato potato  
and pumpkin to make soup I think sinigang the 
process at a start looks very similar as well  
except for the the tumor ring that you're 
gonna add in there yeah I think tomorrow is  
hard part if you use like a normal 
camera really yeah tamarine Tamarind  
turmeric I don't think you can find somewhere 
in like in Russia for example I think you can  
it's coming yeah in Thailand I've seen it 
oh yeah they use uh turmeric for some dishes
[Music]  
okay try sinigang it's almost almost 
ready not yet love you thank you
[Music] try
[Music]
oh so since we have left over we can 
use it as tarpan Talon yeah like we  
need to grill it remove the skin and 
then put oil and then fry it yeah
it's a dish called the name of this yes
but the problem is we cannot grill 
it open I think in Poland you cannot  
be inside our Earth yeah the worm is 
having a good time I think [Music] um
yes but we if I eat this I 
lose my appetized I really  
it's Miranda usually if I eat a little 
bit it's like I'm already full things
yeah in Vikings are you just want salad I'm like 
oh cool this is for few days few days not for  
one day okay yeah okay it seems should be okay it 
seems so big for a few days eat more rice [Music]  
all right so now we have enough space 
inside yeah it should it will shrink  
okay now we add the King Kong yes king 
King Kong yeah gone yes King Kong okay
crazy our synagogue is already ready 
let's see how it looks like great open
wow looks so good yes and all 
the ingredients are underneath
reddish uh the tarot The Gabby and 
the pork belly and the Tomato all  
in essence is already in the soup 
okay guys tell us in comments how  
what you think about this sinigan it 
smells sour already I can smell it  
yeah okay we're so hungry so let's start eat 
and try this is amazing yes all right let's go
price okay with soup here and then 
you put rice here and then you'll have  
soup here oh so separate yeah separate 
you need another something this one okay  
I think we can take a big one 
big one this one big spoon yeah
clicks use this one will be easier I 
think all right if you do here like this
oh so you don't authorize it so we don't add 
the rice we put the dish over the rice do you  
drink soup like a bowl oh yeah it's 
not like this oh so you don't drink  
food like no no oh you don't drink the 
soup oh my God we always like eat food
and that's it and then eat with 
rice with vegetables with beans
so what you did here is like you put um you 
put the soup and then you put the yeah and  
it's like this and drink all soup so for us 
like soup it's the main yeah yeah because  
Leah told me as well that the 
soup is the main dish for us
and this sauce is how you use it ah yeah okay wait
you get some rice to plate 
[Music] looks more creamy yeah
how do you use this sauce so for me for example 
the the sinigang is not so salty I will put some
um [Music] right so if there's not enough 
flavor and you want a bit of extra cake  
then you want to add the fish sauce 
with chili inside it doesn't try okay
so I get veggie first I think my sort 
of steps just now put underneath yeah
how to sneak in good good all right make 
it stand there okay good all right and  
add all the onion ingredients and we 
don't add the rice alcohol oh yeah
because we don't have plates so 
we're just gonna have the rest
maybe we can use it yeah you can put 
the string beans in another plate  
to highlight the the rice and the soup it's okay
the meat is very tender mmm sounds good
I like elephants really like you can feel it 
yeah but nothing like you better do it foreign
yeah straps on me
[Music]
oh yummy that's good it's too sour so I like it um 
yeah home medicine again it's really different to  
um the typical restaurant I think there's nothing 
normally restaurants in gang it's more watery I  
think compared to this one to make it's a bit 
thicker yeah it looks like more creamy it's  
why it's like there's some like ingredients no 
because of tarot I think so yeah I was gonna say  
towel even just now when I washed towel my hands 
feels a bit like already creamy so yeah okay
okay I wanna taste this is soup
I really love sour cream maybe I just need to 
buy this powder and cook every day this powder
