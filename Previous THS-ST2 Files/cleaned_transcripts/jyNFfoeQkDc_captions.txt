Traps with Philippines charity
The Philippines is a land of contrasts.
It's still the third-world, despite what is
considered a
rapidly growing economy.
Plenty who drive Ferraris and Porches, but
there remain those who
live on the street or scrounge through garbage
looking for something to sell, so plenty of
opportunity for Philippines charity.
Decent Australian men in Australian Filipina
relationships
naturally want to do something to make it
better, but is there a right way and a wrong
way to go
about this?
I've long been a follower of the man from
Galilee, and despite being also a believer
in working
hard and taking responsibility for your lot
in life, there are many who had an unfairly
rough start
in life and it's our duty to help out where
we can.
Loving our neighbor means not turning our
backs when we have the opportunity to be kind
and to make up inequities.
Our own blessings
should be shared, and if all of those of us
who do OK in life and have a bit left over
could share
that with those who are not so fortunate,
there would be no poverty in the world.
And hence one of the problems.
With kids, you need to accept that they did
nothing to create
their situation through laziness and/or poor
decisions.
They were born into their current situation,
and if you can help them then you most certainly
should.
We have a house full of kids we didn't
make ourselves, and I think we always will.
And we have other kids that don't live here
but we
help with education expenses.
Helping those less fortunate in Philippines
- Problems?
It all really stems around who you should
help.
From being here as long as we have, this has
been the lesson.
Whenever someone is here and willing to help,
there is always someone there
willing to take advantage.
And as per usual, the problem starts when
the Australian man, who is
just an ordinary man in Australia, forgets
that here he isn't see as that ordinary man
anymore.
Here he will always be the rich man, and those
in need will be very aware of this.
And as I said above, kids by themselves won't
take advantage of you.
They also did nothing to
create the situation they found themselves
born into.
And not all, but many adults have made
their own bed and really need to either lie
in it or make some changes themselves.
But many of
them are only willing to take handouts and
you may be only encouraging and supporting
laziness
and bad choices.
Charities in Philippines
When we first moved here we found a charity
funded by a UK-based international charity,
and
managed by an English fellow who wasn't lacking
in means himself.
They took in homeless kids
from the local dump site.
These were scavengers who made their living
scouring the garbage
mountains and collecting what they could sell.
Great bunch of kids, and we enjoyed visiting.
And
we were more than willing to make life better
for them.
Organised a medical and dental mission
there, with a very kind doctor and equally
kind dentist.
And we had plans of getting them all new
mattresses and bedding.
In both cases, the staff were quick to come
back to us with costings for both medical/dental
treatment and for bedding.
But what they didn't like was that we were
prepared to bring
THINGS (ie.
doctors, medicine, bedding, and we would arrive
laden with fresh fruit, etc).
They
wanted us to bring CASH and not ask any questions.
The last time we visited, the kids all stayed
upstairs and my poor wife was left ignored
downstairs.
So yes, we parted company after that.
And had a similar one with a charity that
would go out and provide food for the hungry.
They
had purchased land, and were building a pretty
nice centre, complete with their own residence
included.
Seemed like nice people.
And I'm fairly sure the American gentlemen
who was the
public front was sincere, however it was obvious
that donations didn't necessarily end up where
they were meant to go, and the feeding program
was as cheap and un-nutritious as it could
possibly be.
Feed 100 people on probably less than P1,000.00.
Everyone has a snack and that
gives them a reason to smile for the cameras,
and 100 people getting fed always sounds
impressive.
But one suspects the profits are going elsewhere,
and this is the problem.
There are some good charitable institutions
here, such as Don Bosco and of course Fr Shay
Cullen and his PREDA organization in Olongapo.
Fr Shay is one of my very few heros.
My
advice is to not give up on the idea, but
to be careful and make sure your money goes
where you
want it to go.
Watch out for charity scams and scammers.
Private charity in Philippines
If you know the situation and if you can manage
it yourself, then you can be certain that
your
spending goes where it's supposed to go.
And as much as possible, try to help kids
and young
people rather than those who are less deserving
and may have created their own problems
themselves.
We have kids here.
Six of them.
We take care of them, feed them, send them
to school and most
importantly give them lots of love and guidance.
If you are willing to do this, you will no
doubt
have relatives who are struggling and are
willing to let their kids live with you to
give them a
better start in life than their parents could.
This is as challenging as any child-rearing
will ever
be, of course.
The kids may be difficult and unruly, and
you have the issue of them possibly
wanting to run back to their parents if you
have a family dispute.
So don't expect the Brady
Bunch.
But we've never regretted it.
The other way is to support kids in their
education.
Could be relatives.
Or in our case we have a
handful of scholars in the province who can't
afford to continue their education.
The cost to the
average Australian is minimal, but it can
make a massive difference.
I think the main issues are not only to avoid
anyone pocketing your generosity by either
paying
for things yourself or relying on a relative
you can absolutely trust.
The other issue is making sure you're not
seen as a soft touch, and ensuring a positive
result.
Because you can easily get burned-out and
sick of the whole thing if you feel you're
being taken
advantage of.
With something like education support?
You need to insist on minimal grade averages,
and on
seeing school reports.
Need to make sure that the kid isn't skipping
school and pocketing the
money!
We've had that happen years ago.
Never again.
And if you have kids living with you?
Make sure you don't spoil them and make them
think
they've become fairy princesses in a castle.
Watch their attitudes.
If they arrived humble and
kind, make sure they remain that way.
Don't be a soft touch, and ensure they never
forget where
they came from.
Once you have a kid who's showing off at school
that they're being dropped off
in an expensive car and going on about the
flash house they live in, and then talking
down to
your household helpers, you will know what
I'm talking about here.
Build bodies and minds, but
ensure you build decent character too.
