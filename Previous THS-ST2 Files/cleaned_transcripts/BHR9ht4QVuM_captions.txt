Guys today let's make bangus so i'm
going to use the whole bangus
and last time i went to the Filipino
store where i bought this bangus.
Yesterday i cleaned the fish I looked
on YouTube on how to do it
so I found a tutorial and i cleaned the
fish
both on the outside as well as on the
inside
Bangus is so delicious guys i also would like to
hear from you how you would prepare it
so i just rinsed the bangus yesterday
under some running water
just to make it extra clean
of course i also wanted to make a very
nice marinade for the bangus
so i made the marinade last night
guys with some freshly chopped garlic
some white vinegar as well as some
himalaya salt of course and some ground
black pepper
so this will give the fish a really nice
flavor i believe
and i've seen this from a recipe also
on youtube
so here it is guys the marinated bangus
tara
lets cook! so i heated up the pan guys
now let's add some oil
i'm going to use a little bit more oil
as last time because
i noticed that the bangus was sticking to
the pan
so let me add the garlic first
so in the meantime guys i'm gonna make a
dipping sauce for the bangus
so i'm just gonna chop an onion
keep it simple
so i believe you call this sasawan right?
so i'm also adding some sili of course
to make it spicy
then i'm just adding some vinegar
and a little bit of black pepper
so i removed the garlic guys from the
oil and i'm gonna add the bangus
there we go
it smells amazing while the
bangus is
