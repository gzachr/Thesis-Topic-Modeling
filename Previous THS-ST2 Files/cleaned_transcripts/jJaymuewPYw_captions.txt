Good morning from Manila.
Today, guys,
I am escaping this city
and escaping the heat as well.
Oh, it is so hot!
It is so hot here.
Guys, I'm going to Baguio.
Baguio is
the coldest,
the coldest city in the Philippines,
and that's where I'm going.
I'm taking one of these
Victory Liner buses,
travelling on
the first class one.
There's a first class one, like three times a day, so
that's what I'm here waiting for.
And I get to wait inside here,
the first class
bus waiting lounge.
I think it's like a wee air conditioned bit,
that you can sit and wait
for the bus to arrive.
Okay.
Okay.
It's about half an hour before
departure
and we've been called to the bus.
This is it, right here.
The first class bus to Baguio.
Now,
I booked my ticket online, on their website.
It was 1,050...
This way? Okay.
Thank you.
I'm gonna make sure that this goes,
that this goes inside.
Okay, good.
Looks nice and safe,
guys.
Yeah, this bus, it was 1,050
Filipino Pesos,
about $20 USD
for a 6 hour journey,
and I booked the ticket online, so
I think these people might have booked it at the actual
ticket station.
They seem to be showing an actual ticket.
I don't have anything apart from the,
the email.
Maybe a PDF or something.
Oh, yeah, I've found it. I've got, like, a PDF ticket.
Hi. That's my ticket, here.
- Hi, sir.
Okay, you have to redeem it, sir.
At the information (counter).
You said what?
Redeem your ticket.
They will give you a ticket like this?
- Redeem the ticket?
Ah, okay. They never told me.
- Yes.
Okay, thank you.
Ah, okay, so
I need to redeem the ticket.
When I came in, they just told me "Go and wait in the lounge."
So, I need to actually redeem it for a paper ticket.
Him, I need to redeem.
Here.
- Okay.
Hello, sir.
Hi.
Okay,
so, I just found that out at the last minute.
Well, not really the last minute.
It's still like half an hour before
this is to depart, but
this is us boarding right now.
And I was able to
pre-book my seat, as well.
'Cause you can see, it's like,
2 and 1,
so I was able to book one of the "1" seats,
so I'm not sitting next to anybody.
Which is gonna be good when you're travelling for 6 hours.
You don't wanna be sitting next to a stranger, do you?
Okay, thank you.
Cheers.
Okay.
He asked me (for) my YouTube channel, as well.
Maybe I got a subscriber already.
We're like, what, like two minutes into the vlog.
Already got a new subscriber.
It's good.
I got it.
- Hi, sir.
Hi.
Seat number 19.
- 19.
Are you coming with us?
Yes, sir.
- Ah, okay, good.
I'm the last passenger.
- Okay.
Okay, so seat number 19 is mine.
One of these ones on the left.
So, as you can see,
it's
reclining seats,
there.
Look nice and wide,
don't they?
Oh, yeah, it's electronic.
I think it's just like the
business class seats on a plane,
where you can push the buttons and
it makes you go back and suchlike.
I assume there's gonna be a toilet,
on here, as well.
6 hours is a,
is a long time.
Overhead storage compartment's a bit small.
Dunno if I'm gonna get my
big backpack
in there.
Right.
Thank you.
Okay.
Oh, this is 19 here, so...
Oh, I don't have anybody in front of me, but I do have,
Just the toilet.
- the toilet. Yeah, just the toilet,
so I can watch everybody go to the toilet.
That's right.
- I can see who.
If that's your fetish.
Yeah, who's drinking the...
I can see who's been drinking the most liquid during the journey.
There you go, man.
- For sure.
And you must be from Australia?
No, I'm from Scotland.
Scotland, hey!
- You're from the States?
Fantastic, man.
- Very nice to meet you, bro.
Very good, brother.
- Yeah.
You're going to B.... Oh, of course you're going to Baguio.
This is where this is going.
But I'm looking forward to some cold weather.
Yes, sir.
- Yeah?
Yes, sir.
- I've had enough of Manila's
sweaty, hot and sweaty weather.
- Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
- Yeah, okay.
So, yeah, this is the overhead compartment.
I think it's gonna be too tight for my bag.
I'll give it a go, though.
No, it's not going.
No, it's
not even close, so
I'm just gonna sit with...
I can actually,
I actually have enough room to just put it down
between my legs, and that's quite comfortable.
And,
yeah, there's some curtains here,
which is nice, because
yeah, travelling 6 hours,
you don't wanna be, like, getting sunburnt on one side.
Like, one half of you will be red,
or brown,
if you're that way inclined,
if you turn brown.
For me it would be red,
and the other half would be white,
after a 6 hour journey.
So,
yeah, it's good.
Oh, so these seats are different to the ones at the front of the bus.
They had, like, and electronic
reclining thing.
This just looks like it's buttons.
Let's give it a go. Nobody behind me.
Oh!
It goes
maybe like a 45 degree angle or something.
It's nice.
Very comfortable.
I wonder if,
if there was somebody behind me, though,
I would be squashing them, I think.
It would be a bit rude,
I think.
Yeah, we'll see.
We'll see if this is full or not.
Oh, thank you.
- You're welcome, sir.
So I think we're fully boarded now.
People are changing seats
and suchlike.
Yeah.
Like that.
So, these seats here, 13 and 14,
they have less width than the rest of the seats,
if you look, guys.
They're kinda, like, pushed in a bit.
So,
if you're booking seats on this bus,
those are the ones to avoid, 13 and 14,
because,
I think it's because the toilet's there.
So, it's taking up space.
So they've made that a bit, like...
They've pushed the seats closer together.
So,
there's a nice wee tip for you guys, if you're
booking your seats on this bus.
It looks like we're getting a snack,
right here.
We've got the
lovely stewardess,
just like on an aeroplane,
we've got our own stewardess, who's handing out some...
I think it's hot.
They smell nice, anyway.
Maybe some, like,
chicken wraps or something like that.
Thank you.
- Enjoy your meal.
Oh, they're very hot. Oh!
Very hot.
Oh, it's tuna.
Ah, I don't like.
Are they all tuna?
Excuse me.
Are they all tuna or different? You have different?
No, sir. They're all tuna.
- They're all tuna? Ah, okay.
Tuna Sisig Pie.
Ah, yeah, I don't like.
The one thing I don't like, guys.
The one thing I don't like, Tuna. That's what they're serving.
It's tuna sisig.
Usually sisig is pork,
but, yeah, it could have been a spicy beef pie,
a chicken pie, a chicken adobo pie,
or a pork with chorizo pie.
They all sound much more appealing than the
the tuna sisig.
Off we go.
Bye, bye, Manila.
We're about half an hour into the journey,
and barely moved.
We're, I think we're just in Makati.
Looking at Google Maps, on the GPS
it looks like we're just somewhere near Makati, so
in half an hour we've got from Pasay to Makati,
which is
hardly any distance at all.
It looks, though, like we might be
joining a highway, right here.
And
on the bus, here, they're playing a movie.
They're playing Top Gun,
but this TV, here's broken,
so I can't watch it.
And that's view's blocked of the,
the big TV at the front.
And I think I'm gonna try this, because
I'm hungry, guys.
Maybe it will be okay.
I don't like the taste of canned tuna, but
it's tuna sisig.
Maybe it's got a lot of seasoning, or something like that,
that's gonna disguise the taste of canned tuna.
Let's give it a go.
I was right.
The
sisig seasoning disguises the taste.
So that's good.
I thought we were joining this highway, right here,
but it looks like we're actually
going through more of Manila's roads.
Guys, we are joining the highway, I think.
Just in the
opposite direction.
Finally leaving this city,
its heat and its traffic problems,
for
the cold, quieter place up north.
Baguio.
That tuna pie wasn't too bad.
And I did bring some of my own snacks for this journey.
Some sweet treats,
right here.
And after 5 hours
of travel time,
we are here, guys, in Baguio.
Philippines coldest city.
Does it feel cold?
No, it doesn't feel cold at all.
Feels like 20 degrees C or something like that.
So this bus, what did I think of it?
Well,
it wasn't that fancy,
for what they call a "First Class Bus."
You know, I've been on, like, the executive trains in Indonesia,
and suchlike, where it's all very fancy.
Yeah, this,
it's just basically a comfy seat that reclines,
and that's it.
You know, there's no, like, cup holder,
there's no power sockets,
there's no tray table for your laptop,
There's nothing...
Oh, that's loud.
There's nothing
really fancy about it,
but definitely worth the money for the space.
Like, I didn't have to sit next to somebody for 5 hours.
The seat was comfortable.
That's worth it for me, for $20 bucks, guys.
That's worth it.
Now,
oh, that's my one, right there.
Okay, fantastic.
That's my one, bro.
Cheers.
Thank you.
Thank you, sir.
- Okay, so,
I believe
Grab works here,
The Grab app. So,
I'll find the exit and try and hail myself a Grab to
my hotel.
I think that's the normal bus there.
Hi.
That's the normal bus.
2 x 2 seating.
My one was the 2 x 1.
The extra space,
definitely
worth it, guys.
Exit, this way.
Surely I can get a Grab from here.
In fact, across the road is a Jollibee.
So,
I'm gonna go for that.
I think I deserve a
Double Yumburger
after that long travel
time. And there's also a taxi stand, right here, as well.
This is an actual taxi
stand, but I'm definitely gonna get the Grab.
I just trust it.
I just trust it more than these
white metered taxis.
I dunno if they use the meter or not.
I dunno if it's like other countries where they call them "Meter Taxis,"
but you have to bargain with them.
Haven't taken them even once, guys,
I've just been relying on
Grab the whole time.
And here we are, at Jollibee.
Where I can get a Chickenjoy or a Yumburger.
I'm feeling like
a Yumburger, guys.
I haven't even checked into my hotel.
And,
yeah.
Good morning, sir.
- Hi, how are you?
Okay.
Look how many staff they've got.
Oh, that't the Chickenjoy, yeah?
- Yes, sir.
Oh, good.
Yeah, so I see the Yumburgers there,
but I don't see the Double Yumburger,
like I had in Dubai.
Hello, sir.
Hi.
Do you have Double Yumburger?
I only see single.
Do you have Double Yumburger?
Double Yumburger?
Double patty.
Extra patty?
Yeah, like a Big Mac.
You know, they have two patties.
Yeah, you can have an extra patty.
Oh, so I order Yumburger,
and then say "extra patty?"
- Yeah.
Ah, okay. I will do that.
Yumburger and extra patty, please.
- For dine in or take out, sir?
Eh, I will dine in.
And Coke Zero, please.
With fries or without fries, sir?
With fries, please. Regular.
132 pesos.
- 132? Okay.
There you are.
So that's about $2.50 for
Double Yumburger, meal.
Which is really good, compared to,
like, I think in the UK, if you order a Big Mac meal or something like that,
it's gonna be more than double that price, so
it's good value, for sure.
You have a lot of staff.
Yeah.
- Yes. How many? How many people?
Eh, almost 60.
60?
Yeah.
- Oh, wow.
'Cause it's right next to the bus terminal, right?
Yeah, yeah.
- That's why it's popular.
Yeah, I just come from Manila, just now.
We are the number 1 store in the Philippines.
Ah, yeah? Good.
- Yes.
Okay, thank you.
You're a vlogger, sir?
Yeah. vlogger.
Subscribe, subscribe!
Dale Philip, Dale Philip.
- Dale Philip?
Yeah.
Okay, we're getting subscriber from the Jollibee staff.
Okay, 60 people subscribe, okay?
That would be good.
I'm getting one, at least.
But they've got 60 staff. Hey, I'm gonna try.
Oh, you actually get, not the plastic.
You actually get like a
proper cup.
So this is reused?
Yeah.
- Ah, you wash and reuse?
Ah, okay. That's interesting.
Dale Philips?
Dale Philip.
Dale. D-A-L-E.
D-A-L-E?
- Yeah, D-A-L-E.
Okay.
That's mine. Thank you.
Okay, I'll put my suitcase,
I'll put my suitcase down first.
I'm gonna
come over here.
Oh, you brought it for me?
Thank you, so much.
- You're welcome, sir.
Fantastic.
Thank you.
Okay, that's nice.
They actually brought it over for me.
My
Yumburger.
So,
when I was in Dubai, they had something called the "Double Yumburger,"
but the Dubai menu, I realise,
was slightly different to the Philippines menu.
There was certain things they didn't have.
And, I guess people have bigger appetites in Dubai.
That's why they had the Double Yumburger,
to compete with the Big Mac,
and the Double Whopper.
So, I tried the Yumburger in Dubai
and
I thought it was good.
I thought it was
at least on par with a Big Mac.
Now let's check this out, guys.
Let's check this out,
right here.
So it is just the two patties together, inside the bun.
There's no extra layer of
bread,
like
you get with a Big Mac.
And it seems to be some kind of cheesy sauce.
I don't remember this from the Yumburger that I had in
Dubai.
It's some kinda... Let me taste it.
Oh, spicy!
It's a spicy mayonnaise, that's what it is.
Yeah, it's not cheese. It's like a spicy mayonnaise.
I think they do have a cheese one, there.
I should have asked for that.
They have a cheese Yumburger.
I should have asked for the cheese as well.
But, it's spicy, guys.
A wee bit spicy, not too spicy,
spicy mayonnaise.
Right, let's
let's get it in the old gob, shall we?
Oh.
Oh, guys.
So soft.
The bun is super soft.
And the patty as well, so moist.
Very peppery.
The patties are very peppery
and then
they're a bit thin,
just like a Big Mac as well.
That's why you need two of them, guys.
You need two, definitely.
Two is the number.
In fact, next time it might be three, guys.
Three.
When yer man's feeling hungry, after going for adventures
here in Baguio,
we'll get three patties in this thing.
Yeah.
This is nice.
Mmm.
It's so soft.
So easy to eat.
And the fries, guys, the fries.
These Jolly Fries, right here.
They just look like McDonald's,
McDonald's style fries.
And just taste like regular fries, guys.
This Yumburger is where it's at though.
And like I said,
definitely very different to what I ate in Dubai at Jollibee.
If you've had Jollibee in Dubai,
and think you've had Jollibee,
you aint had Jollibee.
I thought I had Jollibee,
when I went to Jollibee in Dubai,
but it aint Jollibee.
It's just like the Dubai version.
It tasted like a Big Mac.
You know, the patty.
This patty is like seasoned totally differently.
It's just very peppery.
A very peppery taste.
It's got more taste to it than the one in Dubai.
It's a very tasteful,
tasty,
yummy,
Yumburger.
And the spicy mayonnaise is on point as well.
Just a wee bit spicy.
Not too spicy, so that you're
feeling like you're eating spicy food.
Just enough to give it a wee kick.
Take a wee bite.
Yum yum.
Yum yum.
The fries could do with more salt to be honest.
I don't even think they're salted.
There's like almost no taste to the fries.
They just need
a bit of salt. They give you some
"Katsup," whatever Katsup is.
It might be...
Maybe that's Filipino for ketchup.
But...
It's all about that burger, guys.
That was fantastic.
Thank you, so much.
- May I have your picture, sir.
Oh, okay.
Oh, you want picture?
- Yeah.
Okay.
I'm your biggest fan.
You have really amazing travel vlog.
- Really?
Hi, Jam.
Hi.
- How are you?
Yeah, can I take a picture with you?
- Yeah, okay, sure.
No, no, no.
- No!
The three of us.
- The three of us? Okay.
Selfie style.
One, two...
One more.
Oh, yes.
One, two...
Thank you.
- Okay, no problem.
Thank you, Mr Dale.
The Yumburger was yummy.
Yeah.
- Okay.
Thank you.
Thank you, Mr Dale.
- No worries.
Okay.
It was yummy, guys.
Now I'm feeling good.
I've had a long
5 hour journey on a bus.
But thanks to
the Jollibee and his Yumburger,
I'm feeling good.
Now, where am I gonna
put my pickup point for my Grab?
Where's gonna be easy?
I guess, that taxi stand down there.
It's kinda like rubbing it in the face of the taxi drivers, though.
If I get picked up by a Grab
car, right next to them,
when they're waiting for customers, but
I think it's gonna be the easiest
the easiest spot for me to
get my Grab.
Okay, well scrap that idea.
"Sorry, nearby drivers are busy."
And you can only get a Grab Taxi.
You can't get Grab Car.
So, you have to take the taxi anyway,
but at least I know now,
it's supposed to be 111 to 133 pesos.
So I might as well just
grab that taxi that's standing right there.
If a driver did accept off Grab,
it would be one of these guys, anyway.
Hi, bro.
I'm going to Orchard Hotel,
in Legarda Road, Legarda.
Okay.
Man, they don't even help you with the luggage.
Okay.
How are you, bro?
Yeah, I'm good.
- Good.
Okay, here we are, the Orchard Hotel.
It's 74 pesos.
Thank you.
Okay, that was good. Only 74 pesos.
Cheaper than Grab.
So I'll probably just take these white taxis,
everywhere.
I see them everywhere, in Baguio.
So,
yeah,
he didn't try to rip me off or anything, like
in other countries if you get in the regular taxis,
the regular "metered taxis."
Here, they actually just turn on the meter,
use it, and it's a cheap price. So,
that's good. I'm feeling good about this place.
I'm feeling good about this
city. Now, this hotel across the road,
the Ion Hotel,
that used to be the Holiday Inn, apparently,
and it's rebranded.
That was my second choice of hotel,
if it wasn't for,
for this one.
But this is the one I'm staying at.
The Orchard Hotel.
Okay.
the breakfast will be served at the 6th floor, tomorrow.
Yeah.
7 AM to 10 AM.
7 til 10? Okay.
- Yes, sir, that's right.
And then you have
1,
1, 2,
1, 2, 3,
1, 2, 3, 4,
1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
Good for 6 days.
- So I have 12?
Yes, sir.
- 2 a day. Okay.
Yes, sir.
You also have here,
your spa voucher.
If you want to try our spa,
could be room service or
on our spa.
Oh, you can get massage in your room?
Yes, sir.
- Ah, okay. It's good.
Okay, that's good, guys.
If I can get my
ass
awake at 7 AM,
I can have breakfast
and then have breakfast again at, like, 9:30 AM.
I struggle just to wake up once for breakfast,
never mind
having two breakfasts, guys.
But
the possibility is there.
The possibility is there if I was looking for value
out of this 5,500
pesos per night that I'm paying for the room.
So that is
$100 USD.
Almost exactly $100 USD I'm paying for this room.
It's,
it's not their cheapest room.
I think their cheapest room starts from like,
like $60 or something like that,
so it's like their premier room.
So,
let's see what it's like.
Oh, now everyone wants to use the elevator.
Ah, looks like this one.
Hopefully I can get in.
Good.
Okay.
So it looks like they've only got two elevators
for this whole hotel.
So hopefully that's not gonna be a problem.
I think we need to use our
cards. See if you can push it.
No, you'll need to use your one.
Quick, quick, quick.
Quick, quick, quick.
Scan it here.
- No, no, no.
Quick, quick, quick.
- Ah, too late.
Too late, huh?
Oh, you got it.
Oh, you got it. Okay, good.
Come.
Okay. I'll let you out.
Okay.
See you.
Okay.
Almost...
I'm going up.
Oh, you're going up? Good.
Hi.
- Hi, how are you?
Fine.
- You're staying here?
Yes.
- Ah, okay.
Where you going up to?
Is there, like, a rooftop or something?
- Yeah, we're gonna check it out.
Oh, it's like a rooftop bar or something like that?
We're not sure.
- Ah, okay.
I'll check it out later as well.
- Sorry.
Okay. See you guys.
- See you.
Okay, 402 I'm in.
Let's see.
I can see what some of the rooms look like.
I dunno if this is gonna be like mine.
They've left the,
They've left the doors open to some of the rooms.
Maybe just to let some air in or whatever.
But,
yeah, this looks like what a standard room is.
Hopefully...
It looks very standard.
So hopefully mine is better than that.
402.
Let's see.
I think this is it.
Ah, okay, good.
So, I only have one neighbour.
I like that. I always like that,
in a hotel.
Yeah, that's a wall there.
So I only have one neighbour on that side.
I always like that.
Reduces the potential
noise by 50%,
from your neighbours.
And yeah, it is just a standard room.
Man.
Is this what I paid $100 bucks a night for?
Just a very ordinary,
yeah, it's just a very ordinary room.
And it's one of my pet peeves, guys.
It's one of my pet peeves.
So,
I paid for a king size bed,
a double bed,
and look what they've given me.
Two single beds
joined together,
like this.
They've not even made an effort.
They haven't even given, like, a
a double sheet.
What's that noise?
Oh, it's the door.
Oh, okay, so
you get an alarm if you don't close the door properly.
Yeah, it's my pet peeve.
I hate this.
Every time I get this, it annoys me,
because I like to roll around when I'm trying to get to sleep
and
I end up in the middle of the bed,
and then it's got this uncomfortable bit, here.
And it's just uncomfortable.
So you might as well just have, like, a single bed, like this.
You might as well just be in a room with twin beds,
because all they've done is stuck two twin beds together.
You know?
Anyway, here's yer man complaining already.
He's been in the room for, like, 5 seconds
and already found something to complain about.
"Oh, you complain about everything!"
"You complain about everything!"
I paid $100 bucks a night guys,
in the Philippines.
Anything over $100 bucks a night, for a hotel,
you get to complain about anything you want, really.
Everything should be perfect.
Now look at this,
for your
for your chair.
I don't know if I'm gonna be (comfortable.)
That's a very unusual
bucket style chair.
I dunno if I'm gonna be comfortable sitting here or not.
Oh, no.
This wire is, like, sticking in my back, here.
So they've got a cushion for your back
but it only goes to the bottom of your back.
And this,
I just felt it straight away,
that's pressing into my back.
So, I dunno.
At least my legs fit under,
at least my legs fit under the table.
And this,
they've given you,
yeah, this. Oh, look at this. It's not even,
it's not even,
it's not even flush.
It's on, like, an angle.
It's all, like, messed up.
I think it's actually,
this is, like, damaged or something.
It's not even, like,
level.
I dunno.
I guess I can just probably sit here,
and put my laptop there
and that can be my,
my working desk.
At least it's proper flat.
Not any annoyances.
A nice big TV. That's nice, isn't it?
The room is nice and clean.
It smells nice.
Everything
looks like it's in good condition.
Look at the floor.
It's not worn out or anything.
So this was probably refurbished
recently.
And it looks like I've got a balcony,
out here, guys. Let's see.
Yes.
Oh, check out the view.
Oh, this is nice, isn't it?
See, you're getting some value out of your
$100 a night
here, with this view.
Check this out.
Very nice, guys, very nice.
And the air,
the air in this city is so fresh.
Right now, it's about,
maybe it's about 5 PM right now
and it feels like
maybe 18 or 19 degrees,
when the sun's going down in Scotland
on a hot summer night.
Not hot.
A warm,
a warm summer day is just ending in Scotland
and it just feels fresh.
You feel good.
That's what it feels like, here.
Totally different from Manila.
You know?
I'm not even,
not even close to sweating,
when I've been outside here.
So,
yeah, this is good. I'm gonna enjoy this city, guys.
Just walking around and stuff.
I did ask the
lady checking me in, if they rent motorbikes,
and she said no, and she doesn't know anywhere that
rents motorbikes.
And then I asked a guide,
a guide who was guiding an old German couple,
and he said, in this city,
he doesn't think so.
There's no, like, companies or anything like that.
But maybe if I, like, look on a Facebook group,
or something like that,
I can find some, like, individual person who will
rent me their
bike.
Anyway, guys,
that's a problem for tomorrow.
I'm gonna try and sort that out tomorrow.
This balcony...
Where's the chair?
If you've got a nice balcony like this, you wanna be,
you want, like, a wee table and a chair
so you can have your Coke Zero and a wee snack
and just sit there and enjoy the fresh air, because
yeah, I will be spending time on this balcony, guys.
I will be spending time on this balcony.
It's lovely.
But,
I can't be standing up.
I guess I would just have to drag that chair out, and that table.
That. I would just drag that out, I guess,
and pull it back in when it's raining.
Like that. I guess that's not too bad.
We can do that.
We can do that, guys.
Okay, so,
you know, some things to complain about,
some things to be happy about, guys.
A nice balcony,
a nice view, a nice clean room.
A very small air conditioning unit,
that you probably wont even need.
I imagine you could just get away with, the whole trip,
not using AC.
"Push to open?"
That's strange.
"Push to open."
Really, you don't pull this?
Ah, okay. Got the Holy Bible,
right here.
Standard in
any hotel room in the Philippines.
Okay.
Yeah, I think,
one of these things,
they only make up the bed if you throw that on the bed,
otherwise they don't make up the bed.
And
do they actually give you...?
They took a security deposit off me
when I was checking in, 3,000 pesos,
so I'm gonna assume they actually have stuff....
No.
Why did they take a security deposit off me,
if they don't have stuff in the mini bar?
That's very strange.
I'm gonna have to do the mini-bar hunt, actually.
Guys,
I'm gonna do that right now, actually.
Oh, we've got a nice big safe.
That's good.
You can fit your laptop in that one.
So, guys, a lot of the time,
in hotels,
even, like, chain hotels, for some reason,
they give you laptops where...
Ehm...
They give you safes where you can't fit your laptop.
Which is annoying, isn't it?
You want to
know that your laptop's nice and safe.
But that is,
that's a nice big one,
right there.
A nice big one.
That's what she said.
Now, the bathroom.
The all important bathroom.
It's looking good.
Got the nice
faux bricks,
on the wall, here.
Nice big sink.
Everything nice and clean.
And
a big overhead rain shower.
Very nice.
Very nice, guys.
Good.
Okay, I'm happy.
I'm happy with the bathroom.
Okay, I think this is worth $100 a night.
Apart from the bed.
Like, they need... If they have...
Why can't they just have some rooms that have some proper king size beds?
Like every other hotel?
Well, almost every hotel,
apart from the hotels that also do this nonsense.
'Cause that is nonsense, guys.
If you pay...
You should be getting, like, a
a refund, or like a,
a rebate or something like that,
when you book,
you pay for a king size room,
but you get that,
'cause that is like fake.
That is a knockoff king size bed, right there.
Just pushing two
normal beds together.
Okay, guys, I'm gonna
go for the mini-bar hunt.
It's gonna be a good excuse to get out and have a wee walk around down there.
Maybe see if I can find a 7-Eleven, or something like that.
And I'm actually two floors higher now, guys.
Hi.
Just came up to the roof to see what was here.
It's just the restaurant,
the buffet restaurant behind me.
That 1 PM til 5 PM
restaurant.
I think they're closing up.
It's like 5:30 PM right now, guys.
So there's only, like,
30 minutes of daylight left.
Oh, I see,
they're ordering from a menu,
so you can get "à la carte" food here as well,
when the buffet is not on.
That would be the buffet there.
Kinda small buffet.
Yeah, there's about half an hour of daylight left,
so I'm gonna head out.
We drove past a kinda park area,
that's very close to the hotel
and there was a lot of goings on there.
People just hanging out and stuff. So,
I'll enjoy the last half an hour of daylight here,
in Baguio, by,
I dunno, going for a walk in the park or something like that.
Hey, guys.
- Hello.
Here we go.
We've got
guys selling all sorts of stuff,
like "Special Strawberry Ice Cream."
Special Strawberry Ice Cream?
- Yes.
What's special about it?
What makes it special?
- Strawberry.
Strawberry.
Yeah, but what makes it special?
It's strawberry ice cream, but what makes it special?
Why is it special?
Very tasty?
Special.
Okay, how much is one cone?
30 / 50.
Oh, 30 / 50?
Okay, I'll take 30, please.
Okay, that's good. Only 30.
That is like,
$0.55 or something like that.
Not too bad,
for the special. Let's see.
Oh, you have two.
You have blueberry.
That's blueberry, right?
Strawberry.
- That's strawberry?
Yeah, I want the special one.
This is the special one, apparently.
The blueberry isn't even advertised.
That's good, 30
pesos.
It's a good deal.
Okay.
That's for you. This for me.
Okay, thank you, brother.
Thank you.
Okay.
- Thank you.
I got a
30 pesos, a 50 cent, ice cream cone,
to enjoy, as I
walk around this park.
Everything's special here, look,
they've got special ice scramble.
Hi.
They've got Special Ice Scramble.
I wonder what that is.
- Ice Scramble, sir.
It's like Halo Halo?
Yeah.
- Ah, it's like Halo Halo.
Ah, okay. Maybe I'll try later.
I'm gonna eat my strawberry,
special strawberry.
More ice cream.
Oh, strawberry and ube.
Maybe that's what the blue thing was, back there.
Maybe it's ube.
Ube is like a,
something like a sweet potato,
that's very popular in the Philippines.
They use it in a lot of food,
especially desserts.
And over here's, like, a wee racetrack for the kids.
Look at this.
Got all sorts of different vehicles.
There's ones for big kids as well.
Look at these two big kids,
playing on their pedal things.
Little,
little pedal quads.
That's what they are, pedal quads.
Hi.
Okay, that's good.
See look, they've got wee ones and big ones.
That looks like fun, doesn't it?
But,
yeah, I don't have any free hands right now, guys.
I might try that later.
Okay, let's go for a wander around this park.
Guys, and this park is
the centre.
Basically, it's the centre of Baguio.
If you look at Baguio on a map,
Hi, sir.
- you'll see... Hi!
You'll see this green area,
like a big green rectangle* with a lake...
There's the lake, right there.
Let's go and check that out.
With a lake in the middle.
And it's basically the centre of Baguio.
Everything seems to be built up around that.
So, that's where I am right now.
And look, everybody hanging out, enjoying themselves.
Hi, guys.
Hi.
- Hi.
Hello.
- All the friendly people here.
Look, some people in t-shirts, some in jackets.
For me,
it's t-shirt weather.
For some of the locals it's more like jacket weather.
Hi, how are you?
- Massage.
Massage? Ah, no, I'm just enjoying ice cream right now.
- Ah, okay.
Ah, okay, good.
Oh, they're giving,
giving foot...
- Can I get a selfie with you?
Selfie? Ah, okay.
You're getting a massage, yeah?
- Yeah.
Okay.
- Blogger.
- Yeah.
Very nice.
- Nice.
Okay, good. Enjoy your massage.
Okay, good.
Yeah, that's good.
- How about you, sir? You don't want
How about you?
- Massage?
What's that? Ah, not right now.
I'm just walking and eating ice cream. Yeah.
- Ah, okay.
Enjoy, enjoying.
- Enjoy your ice cream, sir.
Thank you, so much.
Okay, that's good.
You can come down here,
play on a pedal quad,
go for
a little
float around on a boat,
in the lake, right here.
Let's see if I can step over.
Yeah, there's all sorts of different boats.
You've got the swans that you pedal,
the pedalos,
and you've got other ones where you can paddle.
Or maybe somebody paddles for you.
But,
yeah, there's more than a hundred people enjoying
boat rides, right now, in the park.
Very nice, isn't it?
Oh, I haven't even tasted the,
the strawberry ice cream.
Let's get it eaten, so that I've got a free hand again.
Ah, yeah, it tastes
very artificial.
I don't think there's real strawberries in this.
Yeah, there's little, like,
strawberry jellies.
You know what it tastes like,
it tastes like strawberry
milk.
If you get, like, a strawberry milk
out of 7-Eleven or something like that,
that's what it tastes like.
But there's wee chunks of
strawberry jelly.
Okay.
This is lovely.
This is the first time I've been walking around,
outdoors in the Philippines and I feel fresh, guys,
I feel fresh and I feel good.
So,
yeah, I'm enjoying this city,
Baguio.
Mmm.
This looks like the selfie spot, right here.
Everybody's getting selfies.
Oh, there's a guy,
a guy actually fishing here.
So they must have fish.
They must have fish inside this lake.
Ah.
- Ah, blogger.
Very nice.
I just heard "blogger."
Yeah, me, I'm blogger.
I just...
I...
- You are a vlogger?
Yeah, vlogger.
Yeah, that's what I'm doing.
Yeah, that's why I'm holding the camera.
From what country?
Scotland.
Oh, wow.
Mmmm.
More cold than Baguio.
Scotland, more cold than Baguio.
Make pictures.
Oh, picture with your son?
Son?
- Yes.
- No, together with you.
Ah, it's your son?
Yes.
- Ah, okay.
You like basketball?
- No.
I guess, a little bit.
- No?
A little bit?
1
2
And, and, use your camera.
Not this one.
Uh?
Video camera, video.
Blogger, blogger camera.
I watch your videos, actually.
You watch my videos?
- Yes.
Ah, on Facebook or YouTube?
Facebook.
- Ah, okay, good.
I follow you, also.
Are you a basketball fan.
A little bit a basketball fan?
- Yes.
Why not football? Why not football?
I used to.
You used to? Really? Oh, I met the first,
- Yes.
the first Filipino who likes football.
Every other Filipino that I ask,
they don't like football.
So it's good.
First Filipino who likes football.
It's good.
Okay, I'm gonna have to eat this quick,
'cause it's starting to melt.
Even in this cold weather,
it's starting to melt.
So that's the different options, there,
on the boats.
200, 250 or 300.
And you can pay an extra 50 and get somebody to row for you.
That seems like a bargain.
Yes, sir, boat ride.
Hi, I want the one, just for one person.
Just for one person?
- Which one?
The swan or the pontoon
or...? Yeah.
- The pontoon is better, sir, because it's lighter.
Yeah.
- That's 250 pesos.
250? Okay, I will take that.
And easy for me to pedal by one person, yes?
- Yes, sir, yeah.
Okay, I don't a guide or rower?
Yes, sir.
Do you have change for 1,000?
No, sir. Do you have exact amount?
- No?
Let me see.
I might have to give you all my change.
Oh, do you have 50?
50?
Sir, yes, we have.
Yeah? Okay, good.
- Thank you. Here's your ticket.
Okay, thank you.
Here's your change. Kindly wait for your boat.
I wait for my boat here? Okay.
Just give them the ticket.
I give the ticket? Okay.
- Yes, sir.
And I will get... A pontoon is what I'm getting, right?
Yes, sir.
- Okay.
250
for the pontoon.
Oh, it's me?
This is the pontoon?
Yes, sir.
- Okay.
That's my ticket.
So I just jump.
Which side is better?
Whatever you want.
Whatever is...? Okay.
- Yes.
I feel like I'm gonna fall.
Let's see.
- Are you a blogger?
Yeah, I'm blogger
on YouTube and Facebook.
- I see on YouTube.
Okay.
- Give me shoutout.
Watching on your videos.
You watch my video? Okay, thank you, bro.
Thank you.
Cheers.
Okay, yeah, give me a push.
It will be useful.
That one is for your direction.
This one.
- Which for direction?
This one.
- Oh, this?
Yes. Left and right, only.
Okay, I'll try and figure it out.
Okay, there's only two options. Left and right.
So...
Okay, let's go, guys.
Start peddling.
No problem for yer man with two strong legs.
Gotta avoid the traffic.
Now which way.
Oh.
Uh oh. I'm gonna crash.
Can I reverse? I'm trying to reverse.
I think I can. Yeah, I'm reversing.
That's good. I managed to break.
I managed...
So I've worked out one thing.
If you pedal backwards, you can break.
So that's good.
I'm trying to avoid the ladies here.
Otherwise it's gonna be like dodgems.
It's gonna be like dodgems.
Yeah, I don't wanna...
It would be worse than dodgems, because
if they end up in the lake,
that's a bad scenario.
Right, so I think I've figured this out.
I think when I,
I think when I moved it,
when I pulled it clockwise,
the boat goes clockwise. So, look.
If I push this clockwise,
the boat's going clockwise,
and if I go anti-clockwise,
the boat is also...
Oh my God. You need...
Oh no!
It's going clockwise regardless.
Okay, reverse, reverse.
Reverse, reverse, reverse.
Reversing works, though.
And that's,
that's the motors there.
Oh, here we go.
Ah, I think there's actually like two modes.
There's like here,
which is straight, I think.
So that's me going straight.
And then
if I do that
I'm going
to the left.
And then
that's straight again, I think.
And then if I do it this way,
I'm going to the right.
But it doesn't go all the way.
I don't get it.
Yeah.
I don't really get it.
I think, roughly, clockwise is clockwise
and anti-clockwise is anti-clockwise.
We'll figure it out
and hopefully not bump into somebody.
And that looks like a massive mall, right there.
SM City Baguio.
Looks like a massive mall.
Hi, guys.
- Hi!
How is your boat ride?
It's really good.
- Good?
Oh, very relaxing.
You're going slow for them.
It's good because they've got a baby and little kid.
He's going slow.
What's your YouTube account?
Dale.
Dale.
- Dale?
Yes.
- I watch your video, Mr Dale.
Thank you.
I'm still trying to figure out how to steer this thing.
I think...
Yeah, I'll just...
I'll just go slow, otherwise
we'll have a disaster, guys.
I wanna try and do a loop of the whole thing.
And I don't even know what I paid for.
I just gave them
250 pesos.
I dunno if that was 250 pesos for
half an hour or what,
or it's just until my legs get tired.
Maybe that's what it is.
I can't imagine people want to stay out here all day.
When you have to, like, use your
manual leg power.
No problem for yer man, though.
Okay, I'm gonna go to there
and do the full loop,
down to this boat here.
This way,
is taking me this way.
Down there, that's what I'm moving.
That's what I'm moving, down there. These rudders.
Uh oh, uh oh!
I was concentrating on the rudders.
Faster, faster, faster.
Pedal, pedal, pedal, pedal, pedal.
Avoided them. Hi!
Okay.
I avoided them, just.
I had to speed up a bit.
Okay, I'm gonna,
I'm gonna go down there with the
Loch Ness Monster, it looks like.
Am I Scotland? That looks like the Loch Ness Monster,
down there. Let's go and
investigate that.
Hey, I'm getting my photograph taken by the
sea horse.
Hi.
Well,
yeah, I thought I had figured this out, but,
guys, sometimes you pull this anti-clockwise
and it goes clockwise.
I don't really get it.
Basically what I'm doing is,
if I'm going in the opposite direction,
I just push it the opposite way,
and eventually...
Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh.
Traffic.
Traffic problem.
Hi.
Hi.
Another seahorse.
Okay.
Let's do the loop.
Bro!
This Lock Ness Monster?
Loch Ness Monster, yes?
I think it is the Loch Ness Monster.
Yeah, I think that's what it is.
Yeah, okay, so I'm gonna start my loop.
I'm gonna start from here and go all the way
back to the starting point.
Let's see if we can overtake some people.
Hi, guys!
How are you?
- I watch your videos.
You watch my videos?
Okay.
I'm overtaking you.
You're too slow.
You're too slow.
Let's overtake people, guys.
Have I got enough room to squeeze through here?
Let's see if we can do it?
Oh, no, I'm too close to the,
I'm too close to this, actually.
There's only like a few inches of depth at that bit there.
And now it's a problem.
Reverse, reverse, reverse.
Reverse, reverse.
Okay, I'm stationary.
People can work their way around me.
This guy is a professional.
I think I can't go over to this bit here.
It's like too shallow.
Okay.
Traffic jam.
Traffic.
Traffic, traffic.
Traffic jam.
Okay. They don't understand.
Yeah.
The lady got it. The lady got the joke, though.
That's good. At least one person laughed.
Okay, and now we're clear.
Let's go for it.
Traffic problem again.
Hi, guys!
Hi!
- Try not to crash into you.
Got one on each side and one ahead of me.
I'm gonna overtake this one.
I'll go round him, actually.
I'll go round this 'Summer Love.'
They all... Every boat has a name.
There was one called Karen back there.
I bet she would...
- Dale!
Photo with you.
- Okay, he wants a photo.
Okay.
- One photo.
Yeah, I bet the Karen one would complain if you,
if you bumped into her.
Okay.
Okay, cheers.
Okay, I'm facing the wrong direction now.
Let's...
I'm half the way,
I'm half the way
through my loop.
Yeah, I think when I,
take this boat back, I'm gonna get some of that
Halo Halo type stuff.
In the mood for sweet food after this,
burning some energy here.
Pedaling. Hi, guys!
He's a vlogger.
Oh, good. Hi.
- Hi.
Ah, there's the Karen one, right there.
Don't bump into her.
I'm far enough away, guys.
No danger of Karen
complaining.
Now to take this pedalo back.
Okay, good.
That was good parking.
- Yes.
Good parking, yeah?
- Good parking.
Ah, okay, thank you.
My first time as well.
Must be naturally talented
Be careful.
- at this.
Yeah?
- Your head.
Careful.
- It's very high.
Okay.
Thank you, bro.
He's laughing at the way I get out.
Hey, it works, it works, man.
Okay.
Thank you.
Successful.
Didn't drown.
Didn't crash into anybody.
Did the full loop.
Enjoyed it.
A little bit sweaty.
There was me saying that
I wasn't sweating in Baguio, at all,
but now...
I put in some effort
doing that one-manned.
That's supposed to be for two people, isn't it?
Yes, sir.
- Hi, How are you?
Can I take a picture with you?
- Yeah, sure.
You from Baguio or tourist?
- A tourist from Pangasinan.
Ah, okay, good.
- Okay, yes.
Are you a Blogger, sir?
- Yes.
- Yeah, Dale Philip.
Thank you, sir. Thank you.
- Okay, good.
- Do you want massage?
Eh, no, I don't need massage.
Oh, I'm feeling like maybe I will later, though.
I did a lot of work on the boat.
- Yes.
Thank you, thank you.
- I saw you there, I saw you there.
Oh, you saw me doing the boat?
- Yes, yes, yes.
Ah, okay. What have you been doing in Baguio?
Just relaxing for a day.
Yeah, enjoying the cool air, right?
- Yes, sir.
Yeah, it's nice, fresh air. Breath it in.
So good, right? Compared to places...
I've just come from Manila. It was so hot.
Yes, sir, yeah.
- And this is so good, yeah.
And what is good thing to do for activities
in Baguio?
- Eh.....
I don't know, sir.
- You don't know?
You just come here?
- Yes, sir, I just come here.
Ah, same as me. You just got here.
- Yes, sir.
Ah, okay.
I'm gonna have a look around.
Nice to see you, brother.
Thank you.
- See you.
Okay, that's good.
Yeah, now I know why
there's so many massage ladies around, is because
you give your legs a good workout, don't you,
when you're doing the,
the 'ol pedalo.
And then you need a massage.
Yeah.
I'm actually thinking that will be a good idea.
But they've got massages until midnight in my hotel,
and you can actually have it in your room as well
in all the comfort and peace.
So that's good.
Hey, guys.
How are you?
Oh, yeah, good.
Can we get a picture with you?
- Yeah, okay, cool.
Oh, this is more boats?
Oh, this the seahorse one?
Yes, sir.
- Yeah.
The seahorse. I just did the pontoon one.
Okay. You guys are skateboarders?
Eh, no.
No? I was just guessing, I was guessing.
I'm a biker.
You're a biker? Oh, biker, oh.
- Yes.
Okay, nice to see you, guys.
I'm gonna have a walk around.
See you.
- Okay, thank you.
Hi.
- Picture, picture, my friend.
Ah, okay, cool.
I watch... We watch your vlog, my friend.
Ah, okay. You from Baguio?
No.
Tourist?
Yeah, tourist also.
Ah, okay, from where, Manila?
- Tourist, also.
From Ilocos.
From Ilocos.
- Oh, okay. Everyone,
everyone's coming to Baguio.
Okay, good? Okay.
Ah, okay.
- Can we take a picture too?
Yeah, so,
this is like a tourist place for, like, domestic tourists.
There's not...
- 1, 2, 3.
Hi.
Thank you, sir.
- Okay.
We watch your videos.
- Oh, good.
Friend, let's do with my friend.
Ah, okay.
Yeah, there's not so many foreign tourists.
If you look around, everybody looks Filipino, but...
You're so famous here.
- Okay.
Alright.
- Okay, nice one.
- Watching your blog.
Okay, yeah, everybody looks Filipino,
so you imagine you're just amongst locals,
but then
you ask people if they're from Baguio,
nobody's from here. It's like a...
Domestic tourists are flocking here, it seems.
It seems these are all
you know, coming from,
probably places in the Philippines where it's too hot
and they're coming here to enjoy the,
for them,
for them, cold weather.
For me this is,
this is not cold.
This is like, like I said, like a,
a summer evening in Scotland or something like that.
I definitely wouldn't consider this cold, guys.
I consider it nice, though.
I consider it nice.
And unbelievably, guys,
in this part of the park,
I have found guys
playing football.
Filipinos do like football after all.
You guys like football?
Whoa!
If I seen that coming I would have passed it back.
Who likes Azkals?
Azkals?
- Me.
You like Azkals?
Okay, good.
That's good. So Filipinos...
Hi, how are you, bro?
I see, I saw your channel.
Okay, good.
- You were in Pakistan, right?
You're playing... Yeah.
You're playing football?
Yeah.
- I never see before, in the Philippines, anybody playing football.
Every day I play. Every day.
- I subscribe on Facebook.
- Yeah?
Yeah.
- Are you from Pakistan?
No, I'm from India.
From India? Ah, okay.
Okay.
These guys are Pinoy, right?
- Oh, yeah.
Okay.
Arsenal fan.
Okay, that's good.
Hi, how are you?
What is your team, your team?
This.
Ah, okay, this for here.
Yeah, Philippines.
Ah, okay. Where...?
Where can I buy this t-shirt? Where?
You can buy in university.
- It's limited, it's limited.
- Sold out.
Oh, it's sold out?
Yes.
- Ah, okay.
I'm trying to buy a football top.
I can't find one.
Are you gonna record this one.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
I forgot your channel name.
Dale, Dale, Dale.
Dale?
- Dale, yeah.
Okay, okay.
D-A? D-A?
D-A-L-E.
Oh, okay.
Yeah, Dale, Dale.
- Okay, okay.
Yeah.
I need to buy like this.
- Don't cut me from video,
Okay, okay, I'll see.

Footballing kids.
Fantastic.

My impressions of the Philippines
have just improved by like 100%,
after seeing kids play football.
That is what you want to be doing
with your free time when you're a kid,
is playing football.

Enjoy your biking.
Okay.
I'm gonna enjoy...
I'm gonna enjoy a Halo Halo,
whatever that thing was.
It wasn't a Halo Halo, it was something else.
But,
was something similar to a Halo Halo.
Right, can you just walk out in front of the traffic here and they stop?
Yeah, they do. That's good.
They actually stop at
pedestrian crossings.
That's good.
Okay.
Let's go and find ourselves a wee treat.
This is the lady right here.
The ice scramble.
Special ice scramble.
How much is one?
50, sir.
50? Okay, I'll have one, please.
One.
Let's see what we get inside ice scramble.
Oh, what is this? Beans?
No, sago.
- Boba?
Sago.
- Sago? Yeah, it's like
tapioca pearls.
And some chocolate sauce.
And...
Ah, what is this?
- This one ????
Ice and coconut, or?
No, it's strawberry.
Strawberry? Ah, okay.
So we've got ice and strawberry flavour.
This one is milk.
Ah, some milk powder goes on top.
Okay.
And that is the scramble.
And what about this? What is this one?
Sprinkles. You like this one?
- Sprinkles, yeah.
It will make it look nice.
Okay.
So I get some sprinkles on top.
Very good.
For
50 pesos,
which is about $0.90.
Pretty decent.
Okay. Let's see, is this a 50?
Okay, that's 50.
Thank you, so much. Thank you.
Okay, lovely, look at that.
very pretty, isn't it?
That's gonna be nice and refreshing after that
pedalo ride.
Okay.
Yeah, this is something you could just walk and eat,
quite comfortably,
but not if,
not if you're vlogging.
Or maybe I could.
Maybe I can just hold the cup and the camera.
This could be a disaster.
Maybe I could hold the cup and the camera in the same hand.
Can I do that?
Yes, I can.
Okay, figured it out.
Figured it out, guys.
Let's
have a wee taste.
Mmm.
Yeah, it tastes like
artificial strawberry drink
and
milk powder and chocolate sauce,
because that's what it is.
And it tastes like sprinkles.
I think I've got to mix this up a bit. The
milk powder's all dry.
It's not very good like this. I'm gonna mix it up.
I'm gonna scramble it.
It's called an "Ice Scramble," surely
you're supposed to scramble it up,
get the milk powder into the liquid,
and get the chocolate sauce from the bottom,
the boba pearls,
all on one spoonful
Mmmm!
That's better.
And how does it taste?
Well, all the ingredients she put in,
it tastes like a combination of all those flavours together, guys.
That's what it tastes like.
Yum yum.
And that was a nice refreshing way
to end the day, guys.
Now, I'm gonna nip into this 7-Eleven, right here,
and sort out
the mini-bar situation.
I'm gonna take that back to my hotel,
maybe get the room service,
and then maybe get
a massage room service
to end the day.
That's not gonna be in the vlog, though.
The vlog ends here
and I will see you guys
on the next adventure.
