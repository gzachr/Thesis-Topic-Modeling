hello
all right guys we cannot come here without 
trying the food and I don't know how many  
all of you actually all of you when you found 
out the very common tobacco City we need to  
try the chicken in a sauce so here we are we're 
checking it we're checking we're checking it I  
love you Nina bass so here we are it's on 
a strip for those of you are not familiar  
from the strip of like all types of stalls food 
everything like that we just placed our order  
and I have to review of the kitchen and all I'm 
seeing come out of that window are these massive  
plates of chicken in the salt that's when you 
know you're at a great plate and it just looks  
delicious so I ordered the chicken breast I 
ordered the breasts Jose ordered the thigh but  
it's barbecue chicken is what it is it's a special 
barbecue and guys first off one we haven't eaten  
anything second off barbecue chicken sign us up 
we're gonna eat it anyway I call my chicken breast  
chicken boobs chicken boobs it's calling boobs I 
got my chicken boob and my garlic rice and this  
rice looks first thing first by the way before you 
devour or like dive into the chicken you have to  
go wash your hands so it's nice to know that they 
have a hand washing station here and I want to ask  
Will did you wash your hands yeah yeah I did last 
night yeah all right so adding some extra flavor  
to the ticket oh that's so gross no I watched 
it I couldn't make my little mixture of this  
this it's a pepper I always open mine up a little 
splash of love a little mix mix anyway subscribe
here we go guys here we go
give me seven minutes or two
oh my gosh okay first off your immediate bite is 
obviously the burnt part which is the best part  
you asked me the glaze on this was that it's 
very light oh very very very light but like  
impactful the one thing that I will say hands 
down I appreciate it any of the chicken we've  
gotten in the Philippines did you guys know 
how to crisp cook skin better than anybody  
and it still tastes so incredibly fresh and 
tender and perfect on the inside I don't know  
what or how but at least in your techniques 
everywhere else in the world because they  
need to learn look how clean and like fresh 
and like oh my gosh so they say you eat with  
your eyes first and I'm pretty much filled 
with so much joy and pleasure and the wheels  
looking over here rolling his eyes because 
he hates when I use certain words actually  
that's false because I'm busy eating right now 
so he doesn't he's just making that up continue
I told you
wow oh my God this is by far the best chicken 
I probably ever had I mean ever ever it's boys  
it has that calamansi Kickback that 
we'll talk about earlier and it's just  
so flavorful it doesn't need a calamante 
nut hamburger it needs nothing nothing  
you're taking me beat the star on this 
dish but we also got to give it props to  
its supporting extras the garlic rice like 
this rice is so good I could also eat this  
on its own never even tried it yet oh it's 
so good clam I'm gonna do both together yeah
two thumbs up you know what the best part 
of any meal is is that dessert and so when  
you're eating something it just gets better and 
better and better and better with every taste I  
kid you not this chicken my first reaction was 
it was great this is like excuse my French van  
like this is incredible mission accomplished 
and knocked it right out of the park the first  
time so everybody suggested it thank you 
thank you thank you thank you thank you
like And subscribe speaking of the chicken 
that we just had the chicken even saw just  
so you know every piece of the chicken 
is going to be a different price if you  
get fresh you get thigh whatever I think the 
breast was 110 pesos and this guy was 100 pesos  
um the rice comes with it so you get a choice 
between like regular rice you can do garlic rice  
and here's another one I just can't remember what 
it is but good prices because at first we're like  
wait it's kind of expensive expensive but 
then we saw the piece of chicken they were  
like okay well this could feed a family of two 
so we're good we're good so and the important  
thing is it's actually quality so it doesn't 
even matter so it's well worth it I suggest  
get the breast Jose applies to the thigh I'm 
gonna tell you the breast is where it's at
all right we're gonna go try 
something else really quick
oh this is you in it too and the great thing 
about this location is that it's right across  
the street from SM Mall so you can do some 
shopping and skip the food court in there  
and just walk on over and try some of the 
best chicken in the salt in the Philippines  
he's not wrong he's definitely not wrong
what time is it time to eat more if you 
walk by all this food like you can't stop  
you cannot not stop and check it out and eat so 
that's what we're gonna do what is this exactly
and then these are bananas all 
right we're gonna try the oh boy  
that's what they call it here in the Philippines
oh my gosh how is it
all I know is it instantly reminds me of a 
breakfast food like I would eat this during  
the breakfast time I don't know why I can't 
even describe it it's good that's all you  
need to know it's not sweet it's more on the 
Savory side but it's definitely not sweet at  
all we're gonna have Jose because clearly I 
don't know what I'm talking about right now
right it looks like a hash brown
but it tastes like one of those um
one of those like little German 
fried hash brown pieces you get  
for breakfast so hash brown 
yeah it's like a hash brown  
I don't know what it would taste like with 
vinegar definitely one way to find out
you like this yeah yeah let's do it
hmm it tastes better it's like it's a 
little vinegar calamanti some pepper  
so it makes it like sweet and savory at the same 
time not gonna lie I got this because it's glaze  
it looks like I have sugar one day I feel like 
it's gonna be sweet and it is a sweet potato
all right let's try it the question is 
is it sweeter than my man let's find out
it is a glazed sweet potato no ands ifs or 
buts about it get it straight up a sweet potato  
it's very good
you died that's my favorite it's been a while 
since will and I have had sweet potatoes and back  
in the States we've always always had sweet potato 
fries so this is like a good reminiscent of home  
and it's just the right amount of sweetness and I 
probably might eat this whole stick on my own so  
well you might have to get another one all right 
let's say with me I already got a bite of this one  
right it's good
all right guys we're here on top and we knew we 
had to come when we were told that this is the  
best content and that's what we ordered literally 
that's the only thing under menu that they have  
it's 450 pesos and it's good for two people 
and we're just super excited to try it out
all right William first impressions of the concert
I don't know why in my head up this would be like 
a little a little cute bowl full I but I get like  
I guess I got the whole animal it's like it's 
huge but I can tell you right now without even  
tasting it it smells so stinking good like 
I could just smell the tender beef like it I  
I don't know I just want to try it 
I'm I'm at that point now like where  
I don't want to talk about it I 
just want to try it immediately
it's very good it's so tender like 
you can smell it if that makes any  
sense whatsoever you can literally smell 
it it's gonna be completely tender I will  
tell you right now I can already see I 
already know your reaction to it because  
it's not it's not all perfectly 
it's that obviously in bristle
overall delicious
oh my God
it's just melts in your mouth it's just as tender 
as the Muslim wish we had in Zamboanga City and  
there's this map bone marrow and there's three 
times if not six times bigger than the one we saw  
at Walmart yesterday oh yeah but it's delicious 
and we see why many people walk over here  
who is this guy who just better with your hands
I think I'm gonna break
so it's very very good also we didn't even 
describe the soup as a sour taste to it so  
it's very similar to actually most soups we've 
had in the Philippines you guys have a like an  
apple piece of sour so this means like definitely 
elevated in terms of like it's not over at least  
like sour a lot of people describe constantly 
as a cross between seeing a dog which is a sour  
soup and bulalo which is a beef stew soup that 
can be found in the Luzon area and that's where  
we'll get that sour taste home is because 
they use a particular fruit that's a sour  
eating for the soup and it takes about three 
hours to cook this soup so it makes sense why  
they only have this Conte has their one item on 
their menu because they probably cook in like a  
huge pot for his entire day sure would this bees 
gosh it's so freaking tender I think there's no  
throw my mouth sorry dissolve it's already done 
let's see okay the Conte speaks for itself and  
we see why many people will want to order 
it here in Bakula so when you're back alone  
a little warning which we didn't know it is a 
little pricey it's 450 pesos which for us is a  
little pricey because one we're like tuna can 
budget people for the most part but also when  
it comes to food like we treated eat as cheap as 
we can cheap and good yep so and we won't end up  
eating all of this because we we're texting people 
seven Tech we're so fat we don't normally eat it  
um there's gonna be a lot left over in terms of 
that but within Rome you roam also there's a lot  
of bone marrow inside and I know many of you are 
left on the comments it's among the city that you  
will eat the bone marrow so we're just leaving 
for you guys to eat that is a lot of Maryland
that is a lot like this is the size of my 
Arcadian heel your Gilly heel like look  
that's a lot that's a lot
foreign
guys you already know I'm obsessed with Ube 
right when I say right I'm pretending like  
I have a live audience here but I don't oh they 
are known for their yes which is a little flat I  
guess this is more like a breaded thing filled 
with like a pancake like a flat pancake almost  
our friend Mitch got me introduced me to these 
and now I'm like obsessed I don't think this is  
Ube that's not Uber it's not Ube at all that is 
not Ube at all but I'm gonna try it around her
yeah they're good
oh my God wait
this tastes like a maple syrup almost oh
you know it tastes like it tastes like a 
a toaster strudel but like the middle part  
which is the best part of a coastal scooter 
if you're not sure what they are they're like  
Pop-Tart but like it's a fancier pop carb I'll 
stick to my generic popcart but it's really good  
all right it's a good way of popping off this day 
all right guys just kidding we were gonna leave  
it there but we figured we'd take you guys to 
Felicia it would have been too selfish for us oh
what do you see well Ube and there's Ube I'm 
getting all the time they got so many accents  
oh here comes the cake 
here's the cake do what okay
thank you thank you
all right so I lied I'm Gonna Give You Uber I 
saw this espresso chocolate on there I'm like  
you know what I need a coffee so this this can 
fill in that Gap so we're gonna do this instead  
um oh my gosh that's so good 
no that's all right so good
I need another slice already for you here's 
the thing I'm gonna point this out very very  
quickly we've been in the Philippines for seven 
months now and every time we try something it's  
considered sweet we're like okay it's sweet but 
there's a difference between Filipino sweet and  
American sweet thank you it must be an Americans 
like fingers when they say sweet I mean like  
you're gonna have a toothache afterward 
you probably should go to a dentist or  
you probably shouldn't eat it at all because it's 
that sweet they use a lot of sugar let's be honest  
this is the first time that we've been in anywhere 
in the Philippines for a dessert including cake  
and they say it's sweet this is American sweet 
like I mean when we got to Bacolod a lot of our  
subscribers a lot of you guys told us that we have 
to have the sweets here because it's the land of  
the sweets besides the sugar cane it's the pastry 
that people want to end up not wanting to leave
a new victim mean oh my gosh  
I am so impressed with this by the 
way like I never like had one bite
um
so I opted for the Swiss chocolate which has 
caramelized pieces of caramel which I'm not  
the biggest fan of caramel but this is the one 
exception because it tastes just like a cake we  
will have back home I mean I just I don't know 
I can't even find the words to describe the rest  
of the taste because it's accurate but cheers 
he's a fraud because the last time we were here  
we got a kiss a cake that actually had caramel in 
the middle of it and he liked it so don't let him  
no no no no no no this is not his first time and 
he does like it more than he lets on okay continue  
it's true I did have a slice of 
cake with caramel but that's a  
whole different story same place 
you guys did not see it so um
