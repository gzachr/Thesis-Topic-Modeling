It would be really difficult to rank today
Ambiguous
All is good
It's so delicious that it seems to have less rice
I keep eating because of this
There was definitely a lot of rice. It was for 4 people

Rice killer
Sauce killed me

A long-awaited SISIG!
-sisig!
What is this?
Stir-fried pork with ginger flavor
I ate it as a beer snack in the Philippines
-But eventually I ordered garlic rice
-right
you can find at our travel videos
-its fulled
-It is full without lies.
Sisig
Lets get some sisig
sisig
Its nice
Canned scent is stronger than the local sisig
-but its good
-Does it taste like sour?
-little bit yes
-When I ate locally, the ginger flavor was so strong
It's different
And eat locally
There are a lot of vegetables, but there aren't many vegetables here
it taste nice but
This is very different from eating locally
i think so
but its rice killer
I like this sour scent
-To taste
-better
Eventually I ate all the rice
If you think about the local taste
worse than local
If you just try this
-good
-nice
Eat with rice, eat with bread
-umm right
-so
Once I had sisig, it was really good
The most delicious thing you think
i pick this. fish
also fish
-this was best.
-really?
i choose corned beef
Was there anything bad?
I was so excited at first. sisig sisig I've heard too much
I ate what sisig was
It's not that delicious
right. Local food when you eat there
-its really good
-yes so you eat there and
you said "sisig is good"
so you brought this
Naturally, canned food is less quality than cooking
-i think this was soso
-i think
liver
another one was just delicious, but
this one was not good to eat without rice
It was a little like that.
-i also liver
-i got it
we ate well

At first, In summary
Let's do it one by one
everything is salty. so good
It kills rice. its good with rice
If there is one good
It was such a delicious taste
such as corned beef
I can continue eating
Even if a nuclear war breaks out, I can eat it.
Emergency food
Overall as far as I felt
i agreed with nice salty
I was surprised that the amount of contents was huge.
first bought a can, it seemed too small
I thought it would be just a small amount, but it was tightly pressed.
this point was so good and
Of course it was all delicious.
it suited the taste of Koreans than I thought.
Overall, it went well with rice.
Goes well with garlic rice
there was something different from what I ate locally.
Wouldn't it be nice to add vegetables and eat canned food like local ones?
So far today
see you with a better video next time
