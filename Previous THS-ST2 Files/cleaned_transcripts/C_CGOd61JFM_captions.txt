Hey guys, we are bringing you to a Island
Hoping in Samal.
Check this out. Ha ha ha! Hi! He he he!
Our Province belong to Davao Del Norte.
Davao city belong to Davao Del Sur. Samal City belongs to Tagum.
So for your trip today, you have a total of
17 destinations, with 5 stop overs.
Why is it 17?
Cos what you see is considered as one.
Or the sight seeing tours.
So we only have 5 stops.
Okay?
So our first stops is the Coral Garden.
It's 150 hectares full of corals.
It is highly recommended to do snorkeling.
If you have no snorkels, you can rent it for 150 pesos for whole day.
Again I highly recommend you to to snorkelling .
