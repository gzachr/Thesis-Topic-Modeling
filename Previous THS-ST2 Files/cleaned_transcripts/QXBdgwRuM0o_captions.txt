Australian Visa Applications and Filipino
Family
Filipino family members can be helpful and
supportive in a visa application for a Filipina
girl, or
they can be a major stumbling block to your
happiness.
This is one of those matters we would all
rather not deal with if we didn't have to,
but if you want to be together in Australia
as a couple
badly enough then you will have to be prepared
to do what it takes.
Influence of family on Filipina girls
Family influences us all, no matter where
we are.
As I start writing this, I'm thinking how
Australians can also have their relationships
influenced by family members, but really not
to the
same extent and not in the same way.
Probably because Australian sponsors are usually
older and
more independent, and because parents especially
tend to have more of a controlling influence
over their adult children in the Philippines
compared to Australia.
And it's not just parents.
Older
sisters and aunties can wield a similar authority.
What it means is that most Filipinas are used
to running everything they do by family members
to seek their guidance, and if they don't
seek opinion it is usually given to them anyway.
Older
family members are rarely shy in voicing their
opinion, and a lack of knowledge about that
area
rarely subdues them.
The girl expects the advice and guidance,
and is expected to follow that
advice.
That's how Filipino families work.
Now, I'm not going to say much about influence
on relationships, as this isn't the place
for that.
For relationship matters, please have a look
at our "sister site" www.filipinawives.com.au
. I'm
looking at how families can help or hinder
a visa application for an Australian Filipina
couple.
The point is that it is part of Filipino culture
to live in an interdependent way with family,
and for
this to continue throughout your life.
An older sister who would boss their little
sister around
when she was 5, she will do the same when
she's 25 or 35 or 45.
Parents and aunties will do the
same.
Yes, the influence will reduce as the girl
gets older, especially if she's lived and
worked
away or possibly overseas, but don't expect
it to go as fast as it would for a 25 year
old
Australian.
How can Filipino family cause visa problems?
I suppose you have two areas you need to be
concerned about.
One is where the family are just
accustomed to giving guidance and taking charge
but have no negative or selfish motivation.
The
other is where they DO have selfish motivations.
Both are difficult to deal with.
One of the issues here is that it's usual
for older people to know everything about
everything,
even if it's completely new to them.
They are older, therefore they are the experts
and will not be
shy about expressing their opinions strongly.
And they will do this about all aspects of
the visa
application.
Should you use a Migration Agent or "Jheng
Jheng's Travel" in the local town?
Or should
you use no migration agent, because it costs
too much?
"Jheng Jheng" may be an old friend, or
maybe someone else recommended them.
Or maybe it's just because they are local.
Whether or
not Jheng Jheng has any skills or knowledge
won't come into it.
Should you list details of kids or previous
travel, etc?
We've seen visas refused because
Auntie said to leave the details off and not
to even tell the Australian sponsor, because
she was
convinced he wouldn't accept her with kids.
Sadly for them, the Embassy was clever and
found
out.
Overseas travels tend to be found too.
Always tell the truth!
Should kids be included in the visa or left
behind?
I've written a number of BLOG articles
about this.
Feel free to look them up.
Families can get very possessive about kids,
especially in
the case of single mums where they played
a role in their upbringing.
They also tend to be
opinionated about where they should finish
school.
These opinions are not always what's best
for
the kids in the long run.
Advising to use a "fixer" when there are mistakes
with official documents.
Sometimes the
Aunties and parents were the ones who caused
the problem with fake documents in the first
place, and will insist that there is no problem
with that method.
And other times will just suggest
speedy but dishonest "fixing" methods.
This was very normal in the past, but Australian
immigration doesn't work that way.
Not understanding urgency or your wish to
be together.
Many Filipinos marry someone they
grew up with in the local town, and they often
go absolutely nowhere after marrying.
And many
who marry the person who made them pregnant
don't have especially loving relationships
and
therefore don't get why you are in a hurry
to be together.
The result is they may throw obstacles
in the path of the girl who should be getting
on a plane to Australia to meet a deadline,
or they
may pressure her to return to visit and stay
for long periods of time a little too soon
or a little too
often.
This can cause you to breach visa conditions,
plus it can make it hard to settle into a
new
family unit in Australia.
Wanting financial benefit!
This is the primary negative and selfish motivation.
If the family
want to benefit by milking you for all they
want get, then you have a big problem.
It's an insult
to your value and your dignity, and you should
never tolerate it.
We had some issues with my wife's family when
I arrived on the scene.
They were used to
controlling her.
Didn't want her marrying me.
Didn't want her to go to Australia.
Generally used
to bossing her around, and her doing as she
was told.
Then this Aussie with his own ideas turned
up.
She told me she wanted to make everyone happy,
and I told her "You can't!
You need to
choose!"
You need to make your wife or wife-to-be Number
One, and she must do the same with
you.
Can't please everyone, and no one should expect
otherwise of you or of her.
How to deal
with this?
Talk it over and decide between the two of
you what matters, and stick to it!
The
family will soon get used to it, because they
have no choice.
And inside themselves they will
know you're right!
