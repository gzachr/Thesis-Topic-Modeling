this tastes like
mashed capers on bread i'm a sucker for
runny yolk is this an uncrustable
we've got a great breakfast game for you
today it is a can you guess where in the
world these breakfast foods are from in
the world
so you're gonna put on your best carmen
san diego game face and we'll get
started okay i should have worn the red
hat instead
oh this looks good
oh it smells so good
so here's round one so we got a bit of
rice we got cucumbers tomatoes the egg
is classic rice it's not plain rice
there's definitely something there
the rice was throwing me off because
this could be like a super american dish
except for the rice with breakfast okay
i had an idea and now the rice is
throwing me off i do i do taste some
garlic in the rice like a little bit can
i phone carmen san diego please who
she's not aunt i don't know who that is
this is a bulbous sausage
best sausage i have ever had mmm oh my
gosh and then the sausages are like
sweet yeah i'm very happy with this
right now
so i went with south korea
i bet japan
it is poland that makes sense that's the
right answer no i feel like you might be
right i feel like it's more of like a
korean barbecue flavor because of the
sausage is very like sweet this
breakfast actually comes from the
philippines
oh
man
whoa
generally the right area yeah see i had
a feeling i had a feeling
this beautiful breakfast platter is
called long salog it is made with
longanisa sausage eggs and umami garlic
rice
filipino friends who are going to watch
this and be like
you're an idiot like how do you not know
this no these sausages i kid you not are
the best i've ever tasted filipino
breakfast slaps like we gotta we gotta
get more of that yo
round two
so it smells like chorizo
it's very interesting because it's um
it's very spongy but very thin at the
same time it's almost like a crepe so
this tastes like sourdough oh
sour
it's got a cake spicy the thing that
trips me up is is the spiciness of the
meat or whatever man that's good yeah
that's really nice man that's good
that'll start your day off right i feel
like i kind of know where this is from
but i don't know
like specifically
yeah same flat but it's airy
i went with nigeria
and brazil interesting there are three
countries that i would have given you
ethiopia
airtra or sudia
this feels more like lunch food to me
than breakfast ah
it's ethiopian
this breakfast is ethiopian feet feet is
made with shredded injera bread which is
what that is clarified butter berber
spices and leftover water stew it's
similar to how asians use all the
leftovers to make fried rice for
breakfast yeah yeah that's what this
dish is for ethiopia
okay that's pretty cool
what is this
so this is round three this is an
uncrustable
these give me like little cookie pastry
french vibe but the rest of it does not
this texture is insane it feels like a
combination between like bread and like
a rice cake we did an episode with like
indian snacks and the fragrances are so
similar
whoa whoa oh very flavorful i have no
idea where this is from that was a
flavor
explosion whoa
yeah this is quite filling though this
one like it really sits in your stomach
it's a place that's not afraid of flavor
100
and spicy
exactly if you guess the same thing
you're copying me no i'm not get out of
here
india
i put india what'd you play vietnam
i would have given you one of two
india or sri lanka yeah
we got one
yeah i'm so i'm so awesome all right so
i got a point now i'm on the board okay
italy are a very popular breakfast food
in india and sri lanka they are a savory
steamed rice cake that are often served
with various chutneys and sambar which
is a lentil based vegetable soup fun
fact this dish was invented in the 700s
700s this is an old dish this is a
classic this is literally og right here
okay
wait whoa what here's round four these
tomatoes looks like there's some
cucumber very thinly sliced cucumber
this is a crunchy bowl
um
well it has a it has a spread on the
base and the butter oh it's like butter
lettuce and butter i could see this
being served at a sunday brunch i can
definitely eat this for breakfast this
is definitely like a bagels and lox kind
of dish that's lovely that's really nice
all i know is it's delicious
i'm stuck between two countries and
they're in two different continents yeah
cheese and butter is very you know it's
a very european thing right
okay
i went with sweden this just randomly
popped into my fish for breakfast you
know because i don't think europeans
like
raw fish in the morning you are correct
right what in sweden
oh my gosh she is on the money however
this makes so much more sense i've never
had swedish food and i forgot that they
existed quite frankly
so so this breakfast comes from sweden
it is called smorgas it is really just a
swedish open-faced sandwich smorgas
comes from the word s'more which means
butter and goss which means goose but it
loose refers to a butter spread bread
with lots of toppings
okay from what store did i buy these all
things from ikea yes are you serious
oh this is mmm what is this oh alrighty
i know what this says me too i love this
dish so this is round five interesting
all right so i see some egg i see some
hot sauce
it tastes really good though wow oh man
it's spicy
that's good that's a like obvious answer
that i would choose yeah the carbs and
then the protein and the the cheese oh
my god
mmm oh my gosh
so good this is really good
these breakfast dishes are
not familiar
as they say
fine
i got my shirt i put mexico
mexico you guys are corrected it's
mexico yeah
there we go so daniel got a second one
right what south america is way too
broad i know i know these are
chilaquiles from mexico
oh my what's the heart this breakfast is
a traditional mexican dish called
chilaquiles which consists of corn
tortillas cut into quarters and lightly
fried with sauce before being topped
with cheese and other delicious
garnishes this is really good though i'm
a big fan of this i'm a sucker for runny
yolk i may be a loser today but i'm a
winner because i got to eat all these
different foods that i've never had
before what
oh
we got
so this is round six
exactly this is exactly what i knew it
was
right we're free we're feeling that's
why i like this a lot the soup
is so good too have you had it before no
you are uncultured i'm golden i would
never think of this as being like a
breakfast food i like it though this
one's pretty good i didn't know this was
breakfast are you for real you're the
one for me
eating this is always phenomenal we will
be best friends forever
girl i know this dish
so well because of your confidence
so i went with thailand
and we both put
vietnam yes
i got this wrong i would have been so
upset yes wow vietnam that's the one i
kept forgetting
was created in northern vietnam in the
mid-1880s and was heavily influenced by
both chinese and french cooking it's
believed that this dish is derived from
the french dish pot
it's a breakfast dish because it was
heavy enough to get workers through the
morning but light enough that it
wouldn't weigh them down a lot of
vietnamese don't feel that buzz
substantially enough for lunch or dinner
interesting
what
and finally round seven this is a very
black
kind of jam paste
that is salty i've never had a in
my face yeah i was like this is vegemite
because i've seen this before however
there are two versions of this thing
where is vegemite from the is it
australia is it australia yeah
oh that's different
no i don't like that you're just
drinking it like straight black coffee
with vegemite that's a strong breakfast
i wasn't expecting that though
it's got in the back of your throat oh
this is bad oh i don't mind vegemite i
know people are like weirded out by
because like it's really salty but i
think it's good have you ever had
vegemite no but i think i'm just dead
i've always been really scared
don't like it this tastes like
mashed capers on bread like peanut
butter without the peanuts and all salt
australia
boom cow i'm not even mad if it's
actually england because i'm pretty
certain that this is vegemite it is from
australia go ahead
there we go
so you are very close because marmite is
from england yeah okay
so we get like half of a point we have
butter the toast spread vegemite on top
of it and served it with a cup of coffee
so this yeast based spread is equally
loved and hated and is actually banned
in australian jails because inmates were
extracting the yeast to make booze
booze hell yeah dude
so zarya with six points you blew
everybody out of the water today
