- Have you ever wanted
to strangle someone.
(upbeat music)
But you thought about it, right?
Let's go to Delish Deli.
(upbeat music)
Actually it looks a little busy here.
Let's maybe go run an errand first.
It's always a good problem
when it's too busy to get
a seat at the restaurant.
(upbeat music)
We just finished going to Macy's
that's a local camera place here.
In the last couple of episodes
Some of the sound was a little bit crazy
so I want to make sure
it's easy for you guys
to hear us talk okay.
Unfortunately no success today,
but we'll try back later.
(upbeat music)
Sucks to be you.
I think there's an Indian
food place that I know
over by JY let's head over there.
Hello, I'll clap in a sec here.
I'm trying to think.
So one of my favorite type
of foods is Indian food.
I've tried this place with online delivery
during the pandemic
when all restaurants were
closed for dine-in delivery.
But finally I get to check
this place out in person.
So excited to try the food here as well.
(upbeat music)
So I'm sure you don't literally
wanna strangle somebody.
Sometimes you probably feel that way.
But I think that all
of us go through times
where we just don't
understand other people
and it's really hard to put ourselves
into their shoes because we don't want to.
When I was in high school
the one class that I learned the most from
wasn't math, it wasn't
science, it wasn't English.
It was kind of a elective
class that I took
because I heard they
don't have any homework
called Peer group counseling.
It's a really different class.
Basically It was led by the
high school English teacher
who just went by the name Phyllis.
I don't even know what her last name was.
Every other teacher was
Mr. or Mrs so-and-so.
But with her, it was just Phyllis.
And she was just a really amazing teacher.
One of the few teachers in my
whole life that I look back on
and I'm just so grateful
that came into my life.
So this class that I went to,
so I didn't have to take homework is
the class that I learned
the most from out of
probably 12 years at school
and college too frankly.
In this class called Peer group counseling
was basically just set up.
Students would come in
and they would sit in this big circle,
and we would look at each other and
there was a few rules in this class like
whatever was said in the classroom
had to stay in the classroom.
People had to listen to others
before they would speak.
And people had to really
show empathy is what it was.
But it didn't start off that way.
When the class started, I walked in there
and like kind of a typical teenager,
I looked around the room to
see who was in class with me.
And I saw an ex-girlfriend.
I saw a couple of close friends.
I saw some people that
I didn't like at all.
I didn't necessarily know them
but I knew that I didn't like them.
In so much of life, but probably
especially during school
I think our impressions of people
are who they are from a distance.
We don't really take the
time to get to know people
especially I think when we're younger.
So in this class,
I had all of these impressions of people
from the very beginning.
Some good, some bad, some indifferent.
And as that class went on,
it really started to change my
perception of those in the class.
The way the class was structured is that
there would be a particular
topic for the day,
and Phyllis would raise the topic.
It might be something about home-life.
It might be something about school.
It might be about, I can't
even remember to be honest now.
But, however the class would
start off, the teacher would
basically raise the topic
and then whoever wanted
to speak, could speak.
Whoever didn't want to
speak, didn't have to speak.
And during that time at
first, everybody started off
very reserved and shy
and not wanting to share.
But as the weeks went on
as the months went on during the semester
everybody got to know each
other more closely than
almost anyone that I got to
know going through school.
Hold on, foods arriving.
Awesome, thank you sir.
Water?
So what was I saying?
During this class People would share
more and more what was
really in their heart.
And what I found is that
some of the people that
I disliked the most
or that just seemed angry
or not nice people to be around,
were the people that
were often going through
the most in their life.
What they would go through
when they saw a parent at home
or so many different personal situations
going on in their life
really impacted who
they were on the inside
and then who they were on
the outside as a result.
And for the first time in my life
what I really saw is that
how people are on the outside
is a really clear reflection
of what's going on in their surrounding,
and what's going on in their heart,
and what's going on in their head.
And I started to develop
empathy in my life.
I started to realize that
when somebody acted a certain
way around me on the outside
there was probably something
deeper going on in the inside.
In that class.
The lessons that I learned
the relationships that I made there
have really stuck with me throughout life
and served me well as I've
moved to different countries.
And as I've had different types
of personalities in my life.
(upbeat music)
I really wanted people to
get a clear understanding
of what the Philippines is like.
Probably my first thing I ever heard about
with the Philippines, I had
a friend when I was about
19 years old, Mike and his
family was from the Philippines,
And I used to go to their house.
And I remember hearing about
a Imelda Marcos and her shoes.
So it was probably the first
thing that I heard about
with the Philippines.
And then after that, a few
years later I remember hearing
about these huge garbage
dumps where people lived
and just thinking that,
I was really sad that people have to live
in that particular way there.
But living here, I see that
things are so much more diverse.
Yes, there's people living here
in places that are very poor
and that are still developing.
And there's other places
that are here that are
state-of-the-art skyscrapers, and malls,
and buildings, and is equally impressive
to anywhere that I've been in the world.
And so I think this is
something else with empathy.
People can grab a
picture of what it's like
if just a very small part
of a person or even a group of people.
And it really misses
who they are as a whole.
So what's the difference
between being here
compared to past impressions
never being in the Philippines before.
The biggest difference is
those are just hearsay,
when you actually move to a place
and get to know it up close and personal,
when this becomes your home,
when you're making friends
and working with people and
dealing with strangers and
just dealing with day-to-day life.
It's a very different
thing where you get to know
people on a completely different level,
but just because I'm here
up close and personal
still doesn't mean that automatically
I understand Philippine culture,
or what Filipinos think
about different things.
My first impressions
when I was here is that
people are the most kind, most respectful
most sweet people, anyone,
anywhere that I've ever met.
And I think for a lot of,
expats or foreigners that come here
they say exactly the same thing.
I've never met one
person that's a foreigner
that said anything different
than what I just said.
However, there's also
things as a foreigner
that are super challenging here
and that drive me crazy.
And I think those are the challenges.
It's easy to be understanding
or appreciate another culture or people
with the things that you love about them
and that you find endearing.
But it's much harder for the things that,
on first glance are so different
and so confusing that they
just don't make any sense.
What does that look like personally,
on a practical level, it's for
me going to make a withdraw
at the bank and that
doesn't take five minutes
that takes 45 minutes or an hour
and you're just sitting
there wondering like
what is everybody doing
in this space where the
can possibly takes so long.
Or it's buying a car,
which I just did recently.
Mostly in the U.S. that might
be a four-hour experience of
talking to an annoying sales person
and then doing some test drives and then,
going through the loan
qualification process
where everything happens pretty automatic
with them sending out loan applications
to multiple possible banks.
Whereas here, getting a car
that was a six week process,
doing the same exact thing.
And I never knew how impatient I was
until I moved to the Philippines.
Because I never knew that
some things that I took for granted
how quick they could be,
could literally take so long.
Other times it's,
work-related stuff where
we might be hiring for
a particular position
and our recruiter will
interview 20 people.
Maybe he'll find 10 of
those are qualified.
And then he'll set up
interviews with me, with them
maybe only five people show
up to those interviews.
And I can't understand
things like this here,
now what's going on with all of that.
How am I supposed to kind of
perceive that as an outsider?
What does empathy look like?
Not just with the really sweet things
where you're enjoying
getting to know people
and just seeing how genuine
and wonderful people are.
But also when those are things that,
from my background and my,
cultural experience in the U.S.
or Australia, when I lived there.
Were just so different,
some of these questions
I don't have answers to yet.
But what I do know is
that there is a reason
(motorcycle engine roaring)
that things like this are so common.
Nice motorcycle in the background.
Those types of things
take a bit more work.
And I think when it comes to empathy,
it's really a form of
caring for other people.
It's saying that I'm gonna
put myself in your shoes.
And even if you do some things that
at the outset drive me a bit crazy.
I'm gonna care about you
enough to try to understand
why you do the things that you do.
There's an old country song,
it has a lyrics that says,
God gives me patience now.
And that's what I feel like a bit here.
Some of those things, especially patience
I wanna learn a lot quicker.
