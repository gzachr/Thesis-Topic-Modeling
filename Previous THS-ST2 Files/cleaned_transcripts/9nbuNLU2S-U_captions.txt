you can buy rice like this
just put in microwave
after 2 minutes you can have it
just tear here before putting inside...
this is done already...
so just tear here
and put it in the microwave for 2 minutes
then you can have it.. and this is Basmati rice!

they will absorb
all the smells when i cook hehehe
This plant is already climbing to the cieling...

cause it grows so good
