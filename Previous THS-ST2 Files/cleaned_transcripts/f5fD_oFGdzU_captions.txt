Hello!
Hello!
I cannot ....
Shit
Shit
so many
Like a filipina I eat .... three times a day
Oh my God
For Philippines
that would be very rude
Hello
If it's your first time here
My name is Mary Jane
I'm from Philippines
I'm learning Russian language
I was often asked
so today I will talk about
what surprised me
 when I arrived in Russia for the first time
and how different it is
from Philippines
Let me answer some of the questions
This is a question from DreamerKrsk
What is not enough in Russia?
Hmm
What is not enough in Russia for me?
Coconuts
and sweet mangoes
I don't know
so far I like it here very much
I like the people,
the architecture
the food
And what in reality turned out
to be different from what you expected
before you were here?
Hmm
Nothing comes to my mind
I try to not expect anything
You know what they say
expectations are the root of all misery
Polina asked
What words you cannot pronounce?
I'm not sure
so many
Come on guys
write in the comments
 what words do you want
 me to try to pronounce
Oh I know one difficult word
Hello Alexei Malistov
Methemoglobinemia
Methemoglobinemia
Can you say that?
Try!
So, in no particular order
here are what surprised me in Russia
First
Rice
Like a Filipina
I eat rice three times a day
yes
breakfast
lunch
dinner
we eat rice
without rice
food is not food
Well, of course we also eat
macaroni (pasta) or noodles
if there is no rice
First few days in Russia
I ate delicious Russian food
Typical food
buckwheat
mashed potatoes
salads
cutlets
semolina porridge
pancakes and more
It was cool,
very delicious!
But I'm used to eating rice
or pasta at least once a day
Days became weeks,
 I didn’t see anyone
preparing rice in our house
I wondered
if they eat rice here?
when I asked about it
 they prepared rice for me
But wait,
something was wrong
it's salty rice
why is there salt here?
I wanted to cry
I don’t understand
why do you put salt
or butter in the rice
Well, in the Philippines
we also put salt
 or butter in the rice
but only in the fried rice
For breakfast, we usually eat
fried rice with garlic
or in restaurants you can order
fried rice with vegetables
or with butter
Salt or butter in boiled rice?
It is very strange
Secondly
this really surprised me
Tatyana Vladimirovna, hello
Oh my God
For Philippines
that would be very rude
I was very surprised
that people here call
their ....
mother-in-law by her official name
and not “Mama”
Like
Hey
Tatyana Vladimirovna,
can you call my phone i can't find it
Can you?
Yes? Thank you!
We usually say add
Mister,
miss
missis
if we want to call someone
 officially
Or we casually add
Tito
or Tita
to the parents of our friends
or Kuya
or Ate
to the strangers in the streets
This is a sign of respect
If this is your
mother-in-law
and father-in-law
you automatically
call them
mom and dad
In the Philippines,
after marriage
you are considered part of the family
so you are expected
 to treat everyone as such
including how you call them
I remember the first time
I spoke to my ...
to my mother-in-law through video call
I was puzzled
why she always smiles
whenever I call her
mama, mamulka or mamochka
for me this is normal
Only when I came here
that I understood
that this is not the norm
here
Oh well, I like to call her
Mama,
Mamochka
Mamulka
Hello Mama Tanya,
thank you for the lunch today

Thirdly
In some places
you can use your
bank card
to pay for your fare
This is very cool and convenient
In the Philippines,
unfortunately,
our public transport system
generally sucks
I hope things will get better in the future
Oh, I'm halfway! (in recording the video)
Fourth
When I went to the hospital
to get a medical certificate,
I was surprised
that we need plastic
to cover our shoes
I was very surprised
and my heart sanked
from how much plastic
 these hospitals use
every day
I did not quite understand
the purpose of this
because not everyone wears it
anyway
Although I'm glad
that people in shops
bring
their own bags
Fifth
tea
I cannot count
how many times a day
they offer me tea
Do you want some tea?
Do you want some tea?
Do you want some tea?
Yes?
Come on, come on, come on!
If today,
you drank tea
click like
No, I actually like tea
But I am surprised
that here they offer tea
 and some sweets
or a pie
just a few seconds
after a heavy meal
For me, it's like
No thanks
I'm full
In the Philippines,
we rarely drink tea
People there like
soda
juice
or coffee
Sixth
giant
vegetables and fruits
Oh my God
when I first saw
watermelons and bananas here
I was so surprised
 and I
laughed so hard
and big ice cream
like sausage!
I thought
"Maybe in here
everything is bigger than in Asia?"
and I like that here
the vegetables are sweet
bell peppers, tomatoes, cucumbers
everything is delicious!
In the Philippines,
our tomatoes
are small and sour
well of course,
we also have vegetables
that are not available here
Seventh
corridor
At two thousand and sixteen,
I was here around
the first week of December,
so winter has already begun
it is very cold
Once I was going
to eat the left over food
 and could not find it in the refrigerator
I looked everywhere
 in the kitchen
and couldn’t find it,
but I'm sure
that we didn't throw it yet
I asked mom
Mom,
where's our food?
In the corridor
I was confused
Why would it be in the corridor?
So I went to the corridor
in my home clothes
and, oh my goodness
very cold
I felt like
I went into the freezer
My mom uses it
as her second refrigerator
when her refrigerator is full
This is hilarious
We have a freaking
walk in freezer
FREE
Genius!
Lastly, toilets at home
In the first house
where we lived,
the toilet and shower
are in two separate rooms
And what upsets me
is that in the toilet
there is no bidet
or even a bucket of water
In the Philippines,
when we are
taught
to wash ourselves
every time after the toilet,
we use water
from a bidet
or at least a dipper
 from a bucket,
it is called a
tabo
That's why
when I see a house
 with a bidet,
my Asian side
is so happy
Wow
it's so easy to make
me happy, yes?
Okay guys

and see
my previous videos

Thank you
See you!
You know what they say
No I don't know
Vladimirovna
My head hurts so much
No thanks
I'm full
Do this
Like crazy
like crazy
