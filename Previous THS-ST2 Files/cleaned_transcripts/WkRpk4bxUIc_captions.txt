so i'm splitting the egg yolks from the egg whites
so i'm using six eggs in total
so we're adding the egg whites to the bowl
this recipe is uh it's totally new for me 
but i've always seen this one on youtube  
and i always wanted to make it 
because this brazo the mercedes  
it looks really delicious i will add a little 
bit less than half a can of condensed milk
to the egg yolks just like that with 
a tiny splash of vanilla extract
now we need to turn this into a custard  
so i will add the mixture to this pan 
and i will put a low heat there we go
so make sure to keep the heat low  
and hope this becomes a nice custard 
so this will be the masarapna  
filling for the brazo the mercedes now we need to 
keep stirring otherwise the egg will become like  
a scrambled egg but we want to make this really 
into a smooth custard so it should not be too hot  
and keep stir stirring so i decided to use a 
whisk for now because it already starts to get  
some lumps i'm trying to get those out 
but it's getting thicker as you can see
so it gets really nice and thick 
so i'm gonna set this aside  
so i'm using a sheet of baking paper 
i'm going to put this on this tray
i'm going to make it a little 
bit smaller so it will fit nicely
just like that now it's time for the 
egg whites so let's uh mix them together  
and make it really foamy so i will 
first put it on a soft setting
and then a bit faster
faster and faster
now i will gradually add a little bit of sugar  
okay that's approximately yeah 50 grams 
50 grams of sugar i'm gonna add this
so there we go a lot of mixing
so i think it looks really good and foamy
now the oven is preheating at 180 degrees there 
we go that's the sign it's hot so 180 degrees  
celsius i'm gonna put the egg whites onto the tray
so we should not wait too long with this 
otherwise the egg whites will become  
you know we need to keep the volume 
so we're going to spread this
a little bit do you make brazo de mercedes at home  
okay i will try making a little bit of a 
texture with the knife if it works let us see
and into the preheated oven for 20 minutes
180 degrees celsius so while the meringue is 
in the oven i'm taking a turon with langka
set up so there we go that's the merengue 
and i waited five more minutes in the oven  
so it was 20 minutes and then i turned off 
the oven and waited for another five minutes  
now the fun part the powdered sugar there we 
go i'm gonna add lots of nice powdered sugar
so i'm very curious to the origin of 
this dish if you know it please let me  
know in the comments okay so we'll 
add one more baking paper on top
then we'll carefully turn this around
exciting there we go and 
carefully try to remove the paper
maybe i was a little bit too fast because 
it's breaking a little bit here yes that was  
a little bit too fast i should have waited 
a little bit longer to let it cool off but  
let's try to save this one
you see we're glueing it together  
i'm fixing it and now the moment of truth i'm 
gonna roll this up turn this into a nice row
so i think in terms of how it looks i think 
it's okay it's able to make a row out of it  
now let's cut off a piece on 
the side with a sharp knife
i hope you liked this episode
