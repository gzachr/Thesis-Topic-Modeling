Good morning my friends and welcome back to 
another video here in the Philippines it is  
so early in the morning guys it is 4:30 right 
now and uh we're gonna make sure we turn these  
lights off and I'm checking out of the Airbnb 
so we're gonna turn those off we're gonna turn  
those off and that's a wrap so we are now one 
hour and 45 minutes until my plane takes off  
and I'm 25 minutes away from the airport so 
we gotta figure out how we're gonna get there  
and I get through security check this 
bag because I have the liquid in there  
then hopefully we'll make it on the 
flight attire to Boracay. Let's go
figured I'd be the only one awake at this hour
all right it's pretty quiet here in the morning 
let's see if someone can help us get the uh Taxi
can you help me get a taxi to the airport taxi 
to the airport yes sir uh do you prefer grab or  
Uber sir uh whichever oh there's over here I 
we have a grab that's the Philippine version  
of uber oh okay uh either which whichever 
one's faster salamat and oh these are you  
have to inform your agent and give it 
to them sir okay or you can leave it  
interior and inform them sir okay then I'll 
just leave that there then I know sir we're  
not accepting sir I don't know where to put it 
because I already locked the room fertilizer
let me show you guys we're definitely gonna 
make it tough to get on this flight because  
we gotta run back up and drop the card off so 
here we go make sure you watch your processes
uh uh Cebu okay sir salamat all right so I wish 
the Airbnb would have told me that I didn't Slide  
the card under the door in order to uh return 
it because now that's going to add an extra 10  
minutes but it's all right guys we're meant to 
get on this flight we're gonna get on if not  
well there'll be others all right card has been 
dropped back down for round two and we're back
kuya is uh what's the time for the 
grab unfortunately sir we're still  
finding sir I also instructed 
one of our security to find out
thank you so is taxi going to be 
faster is taxi going to be faster I
am Uber but Uber is much more cheaper I mean okay 
but uh taxis are faster yes sir is there a number  
to call a taxi unfortunately no sir we have no on 
top all right maybe here sir okay salamat thank  
you very much all right luckily we were able 
to locate ourselves the taxi right over here
thank you very much all right guys well oh 
almost took the sign down got it right here  
thank you very much uh that's domestic
domestic terminal. My friends, I want to pause 
the video for just one quick moment to share  
with you a very exciting announcement and this 
announcement has something to do with an idea  
that I've had in my mind for the last couple 
years and only in the last two months has it  
finally started to come to fruition that idea has 
something to do with apparel as World Nomac fans,  
subscribers, supporters, viewers you guys have 
early exclusive access to find out more about  
this project. Now you can find the link to get this 
exclusive access right down in the description or  
if you check the pinned comments you'll be able 
to find a link that gives you more information  
so back to the video. Thank you brother.[__]
I need to go to a domestic terminal Cebu yeah
[Music]
the flight's 6:15. 6:15. it's pretty soon yeah
I'm late you're late
William nice to meet you [__]
I'm a vlogger yeah exactly you're in  
the video brother oh really what 
happened not too much this is an  
adventure in itself today if we're 
gonna make it to the airport in time
how many minutes drive to the airport 
you can get us there as fast as we want
oh okay as long as we're 
safe and sound yeah yeah okay
no problem I think since there's no 
traffic it should should be quick [Music]  
no no reason to uh go too fast if I make 
the flight perfect if not no problem
son of God oh [ __ ] lady boy
they're all they're still out partying [Music]  
yeah guys we're cruising through the city right 
now and I just I was looking around I was like how  
are there so many people out but then I just 
realized it's Saturday morning at like four  
in the morning so it's basically all the late 
night Partiers are still out and I've already  
gone to sleep and woken up that's sometimes 
when I'm like oh I'm so glad I'm not partying  
because I couldn't imagine like 
waking up down then go to the airport  
surprisingly a lot of traffic at uh 5 a.m is it 
4:41. You guys getting us here nice and quick  
and we are pulling up to the airport world's 
fastest Taxi Driver salamat kuya yeah
departures right here to the right  
see yes sir oh yeah we're here early now what is 
that time to stop for a coffee for 10 minutes yeah
 15 minutes oh plenty of time  
in the morning like uh one half hour 
yeah half hour to get through security
all right here it is Nino Aquino 
International Airport yeah we're  
going to the domestic service oh wow it's busy 
today yeah everyone's flying out internationally
yeah hopefully domestic's quiet this is 
terminal three yeah wow oh so we're late  
and [__] kuya ah it's something what's 
your usual price so I know what uh what the tip  
what's your usual price for that distance
yeah yeah your usual price uh what's your 
usual price so I know how much to tip
no no I said what what is your usual 
price I got the the price like 400 okay
yeah here's uh here's double bro yeah I think 
you said that's good you're happy with it yeah  
I'm happy all right I am too because we made 
it all right we've arrived to the airport
and
salamat thank you brother goodbye  
all right we are at the airport I hope this is 
terminal three we shall find out terminal three
it's definitely the one we want 
to go on terminal three Boracay  
Air Asia so this is terminal three we gotta go up 
through here wow this is a long line definitely  
gonna miss the flight well it might be a lucky day 
gate six is open so I've got 45 minutes to make it  
on the flight we shall see if that's possible 
but at this point if I'm not meant to uh get  
on this one I'll just get on the next my friends 
so in route to Boracay first thing in the morning  
and I'm walking extra fast right now maybe I can 
pass up two or three people on the way and this  
is why they say make it to the airport shortly 
I figured because it was domestic it might go a  
little quicker but that was just some dumb Logic 
on my part but who knows maybe I'll go real quick  
all right by the way guys I paid that Taxi Driver 
double because he was driving so fast I wasn't  
filming it because it was super dark out but 
literally he was driving so fast so they are  
he deserves at 4 am he made it happen and we got 
lucky here it literally took me like 10 seconds  
to get in the uh took me 10 seconds to get into 
the airport because the other line opened up  
all right we have made it to the airport this 
airport reminds me of a very similar design to  
the Istanbul airport but in the international 
side of it really high ceilings like rows of  
rows of gates up there and we're going up there 
to see one through 15 I want to say and we're  
flying to an airport called katiklan which is 
like the closest one to Boracay you got to take  
a ferry once you get there because you land 
on a different uh landmass than the island of  
Boracay but it's the closest and it's a pretty 
efficient process from what I understand guys I  
did not expect the airport to be crazy busy like 
this in the morning I just goes to show you how  
many people are traveling in Manila at this 
time of the year right this has got to be us
hello brother
all right and I think we're going 
to be right over here to the left
[Music]
Yes actually as a matter of fact I'm 
lucky enough to say that I do they  
have uh this is yeah any domestic background 
counter for your luggage tickets thank you  
very much that makes a little quicker 
that we don't have to do the check-in
got it right there for you brother
okay salamat not on this side are this it's okay 
this Line's longer so go over there thank you all  
right we're gonna try out this liner right here 
let's see which one seems to have the shortest
seems like there's a similar quantity of bags
well we'll try out this guy guys we're 
checking the bag and we've got our new  
subscriber Marco taking care of us thank you 
brother all set thank you Marco goodbye see you  
all right bag checked in and it's time to head 
through security we're gonna end up arriving  
early we're gonna have enough time to get some 
food and a little uh I don't know orange juice  
or coffee to start the day let's do this see on 
the other side of security all right guys we've  
made it inside of the airport here and looks 
like we've got uh Victoria's Secret and Mac  
Deli corner I'm starving right now so we're gonna 
have to find something delicious to eat uh travel  
free shop bath and body all right smells like 
breakfast here that's for certain a cinnamon  
roll oh that's sugar it just keeps getting me to 
Crave it doesn't it got a VIP lounge right there  
but it definitely looks closed pretzels here we're 
gonna do a lap around here though cause I want to  
make sure I'm getting the best thing they've 
got farino's best rice cake in the airport  
all right seal my king oh Cinnabon that's 
what I could smell from a mile away  
but that's so like classic to have although 
it is super early in the morning so I could  
probably get away with it you know something 
like that airport cafe it looks quite nice  
breakfast waffles that could be the move chicken 
ham with scrambled egg and cheese spread that  
sounds absolutely fantastic yeah we got to get 
ourselves one of these that's definitely gonna  
be the move oh with a little combo there comes 
with a coffee that looks fantastic probably  
going to be a bit of a wait but worth it and 
chicken or just a ham cheese spread please
uh just pork okay oh can I 
just have an iced coffee please  
oh you don't have either oh okay all right 
well and I guess I'll keep looking thank you  
yeah two strikes guys I ordered two items and they 
didn't have either of them so that's just a sign  
I'm not supposed to eat there all right guys 
we might just have to head straight down there  
I don't know if we're gonna end up having enough 
time no I don't think so better [__]
yeah I don't think we'll have enough time 
to get food because we arrived here so late  
waffles let me down that's too bad no iced 
coffee or ham but that's all right kuyas
all right so we're looking for gate number 
133 around here I'm thinking it's somewhere  
further down this way pretty easy airport to 
navigate overall it's just a fair bit of walking  
I think we're uh two gates up remember there 
one three three yeah it looks like everybody's  
buddies today I don't think the airport 
could be any more packed than it is  
all right looks like we're gonna end up visiting 
this place here what do we got lucky day creamy  
coffee that's what we're gonna be going with 
now well when it's not up to us gotta work with  
it what do we got vanilla latte caramel macchiato 
and a lucky day you know what today's my lucky day
thank you
perfect
okay we got we got a 100 spot right there
[Music]  
it's a lucky day started I think I'm gonna have 
a lucky day with a lucky day oh let's hope so  
all right let's see if the 
lucky day gives me a lucky day
here okay oh all done you 
have a garbage please you too  
all right we at least got a coffee in us but uh 
now I think this is the gate we're gonna be taking  
right there oh yeah just for your brother we got 
it right there Salama Drew thank you thank you  
all right and which bus this way all right we 
have made it on the flight honestly I ended up  
getting here like 40 minutes early because the 
lines worked out so I had all that extra time  
one to us Perfect all right we're gonna be 
popping on this one right here to Boracay  
oh it looks like a comfortable little uh bus 
here too we got seats right up here these are  
definitely the comfiest airport buses I've been 
on usually like you're on some like plastic seats  
in most places I've been but here I could actually 
take a quick little nap here before hopping on the  
flight and I need to but that's one thing guys 
if you come to the Philippines like you need  
cash all the time all right we're taking the 
bus over as you can see we're still probably  
I don't know maybe 20 minutes 30 minutes from 
Sunrise so it'll be actually a very beautiful  
flight to be flying into the Boracay area 
right at this hour now you know at first to  
be honest when the alarm went off at whenever 
it was 4 a.m I was like oh was this a mistake  
but I think I'll be pretty happy because we'll 
have the entire day ahead of us and by the way  
if you guys haven't been uh watching me for that 
long I've only ever brought my brother in my Vlogs  
like one time maybe in France like 200 videos 
ago so my brother's actually in Boracay because  
part of his team is uh Filipino and so they did a 
company retreat in Boracay so I'm actually going  
to be meeting him as soon as I get there so make 
sure you stick around to the end of the video so  
you can see uh or you can meet my brother well 
it looks like we're going to be arriving to our  
plane actually a bigger plane than I expected 
to be doing a little island hopping I'm at kuya
all right and we are here Cebu Pacific it's 
looking shiny that's great you know you can  
see how clean these planes are I've been on a 
couple planes I mean it's probably because it's  
in the Middle East when I've been there that are 
like so Sandy you can't even look out the windows
but like this one looks like they just put this 
thing right through the good old plane wash
the Air Asia too that's a budget 
Airlines but generally like all  
it all seem to be like in pretty close 
competition with each other in terms of  
like pricing, I think I paid $70 which included a 
bag uh and that was booked less than 24 hours ago  
so I'm in a pretty reasonable price if 
you booked far enough in advance you can  
get it for like 30 and I'm talking one way 
here not with a return ticket because I'll  
do a little island hopping before I return 
to Manila but so this is it Cebu Pacific a
all right sure we gotta find our seat here 
I did not select my seat so knowing my luck  
that's gonna be a window oh yeah good old window 
right there gonna be easy so we've got to go to  
uh 18e looks like everybody's going to Boracay 
today hello good morning [__] very good  
okay 18. so it looks like we're 
going a little further back  
and we are going to be going oh sorry I'm 
gonna be going right here 18a middle seat  
so guys we've got a one hour flight to get there 
I'm probably not gonna Vlog through my channel  
because it's a quick flight still pitch black out 
but uh yeah it'll be I mean it's I think one hour  
gate to gate so maybe 45 minutes in the air just 
going south in the Philippines so let's do it
thank you all right guys and we have 
arrived to the island so now we're  
deplaning I'm guessing it's a small 
airport because we're not walking  
onto any like gate uh we're just taking the 
light around thank you very much thank you  
all right now it's time for the sunglasses on 
let's see if we've got them oh there they are
oh yeah welcome welcome my friend look at 
that we landed right next to the ocean there  
small little arrivals building 
guys overall a pretty uh quick  
flight and take like an extra hour to take 
off like by the time we took off we were  
already supposed to be arriving so I think we 
arrived maybe 35 minutes late but I mean still  
here before 8 A.M but it feels like much much 
later since I've been up for hours at this point  
so this is it this is definitely one of the 
smallest airports I think I have ever arrived to  
and now we gotta find the bags and that's 
it okay baggage over here brother yes  
okay it looks like we'll be waiting right over 
here all right this is the first time I've seen  
luggage delivered like this I basically just set 
it right here on this platform and that's it so  
hopefully mine's in there almost a cup all right 
I see my bag it has arrived the very back though  
all right here we go we've got the bag now 
we can save officially welcome to the islands  
got to figure out first where to get some cash 
second how to get to this Ferry Boracay here  
we come oh they said we've got boracai transfers 
kamos takuya yes please my hotel is hang on what
okay all right all right and uh 
you can I play with card here yes  
sir oh that makes life much easier 
for me all right you got me sold
Nice to meet you, Lisezal, my name is Mac
guys we're labeling ourselves right let's 
see where's it gonna look good right there  
how's that look you see that oh yeah there 
we go we're ready so guys yeah basically  
we're getting the bus we're getting the boat 
and then the bus so you just get the whole  
package in one and it makes it easier but 
thank you so much liezel thank you very much  
yeah guys so I paid like uh probably $18-$19 
to be able to get like the full service with  
basically door to door but I mean you get 
what you pay for right so I probably could  
have done it a little bit cheaper if I found a 
cab separately there and then uh from there paid  
for the ferry directions oh is that gonna 
be me brother Southwest oh yeah that's me
all right that looks like our big boy we're 
gonna be taking to the ferry right there  
that's the one brother all right all 
right Southwest bus we're loading up  
so this is hassle-free for 20 bucks guys 
I bet like if I pieced it all out on my  
own you'll probably get there for about 10 
but uh just uh easier to do this comparable
gearbiss no bring that with yeah good Solomon
all right this is the bus we've got 
the AC on here that is nice okay  
looks like we'll have to take a seat right here
that's a wrap we made it but yeah guys like I 
said it's probably much easier to do this you know  
could make one card payment get directly on the 
bus get to the ferry they get you there normally  
I honestly would prefer to like figure it all out 
on my own but since I got up so early today I was  
like this is just an easier way to do a packable 
bucks extra and get from point A to point B  
as possible all right guys so we're over there 
to the right you can actually take it looks  
like a bike taxi and buses from over there like 
only inside of the airport can you get like a  
pre-booked uh let's say bus like we have or van 
crazy like we're literally right here on the  
coast like probably 100 meters away is um the 
proximity from the airport to the Sea I think  
we'll have some pretty nice views 
along the drive to get to the ferry
yeah so these next videos are gonna be much 
much different than all the videos we shared  
with you guys in the cities of Manila, Makati 
and BGC because obviously I mean it's much more  
rural over here and we'll probably get a deeper 
look into like the village of life, Island life  
but it looks awesome just based on like 
how everything looks I bet it gets a lot  
of rain or probably recently did that's why 
it seems like everything's wet at the moment  
but that's the nice part about Islands 
even if you get hit by some rain during  
the day you're guaranteed to get a bit of 
sun, a little bit of rain a mix of it all  
basically the island we landed on Caticlan.
To be honest I've never heard of it
I've never done any research on the series flew 
to Boracay because my brother's down here right  
now but um it's not as well known let's say it's 
like Palawan, Boracay, El Nido it seems like it's  
developing you know there's a lot of construction 
just in these first couple kilometers driving in  
after about a seven minute ride roughly we have 
arrived so it looks like the ferry port a lot  
going on around here and it looks like Shangri-La 
might even have their own private ferry port  
all right gonna grab our suitcases 
and move on to the next step
all right the question is where 
are we going from here Southwest
this way brother yes sir all right 
we've got the Express ferry how long  
is the ferry brother uh eight ten minutes 
eight to ten minutes oh nice and quick then  
so it looks like if you want to buy your own 
ticket there is a uh another way to go come on
go inside right here yeah
Southwest tours to the left that is the 
nice part we get our own dedicated uh  
passageway here so maybe 
that speeds things up a bit
is there a document we need to fill out is 
there a document we need to fill out yes okay  
hello brother [Music] uh yeah 
yeah my receipt you mean or I  
need to fill out a form uh yeah uh 
like this where do I get that now
thank you thank you here's our guy right here it 
looks like we're going back this way oh all right
a republic of Philippines
uh all set to go then
it's a bit of a messy process but uh slower 
than I expected to take to get here but quick  
enough where we'll still get there by nine 
I'd say all right we got ourselves a number  
here number 17. so we're gonna be taking 
that and I guess heading towards the boat  
yeah definitely a plan for it that you'll have a 
couple hours like after you land at the airport  
probably two hours total of time to get like if 
you go through like a company like I did maybe  
it's faster maybe it's the same amount of time if 
you're uh basically booking each way separately  
but um you would just have to basically pay 
stuff really for a bus to get there or tuktuk 
separately for the ferry separately 
for the environmental fees for registration  
and then separately for the uh last Vote or 
Texas it's your hotel once you're on Boracay  
but it looks beautiful on this side lots 
of fairies small ones and larger size ones
all right I think we have located the ferry we're 
going to be getting on they remind me of the  
ferries I took from like Bali to Nusa Panida just 
small little speed Runners that go from one Island  
to the other oh we got a guy down there going for 
a little swim doing a little cleaning actually
okay so the uh number here actually pertains 
to the boat you get on so this one over here  
is named uh stars in the Sun as you can see 
we got a little bridge to cross there moving  
around with the uh tide a bit here we've got 
a fellow GoPro brother right there there he is  
seems like sometimes it's one at a 
time other times it's like multiple  
people at a time see if we can 
do this one-handed all right
[__]perfect
[Music] 60 persons on this boat 
60 packs welcome aboard all right  
here we go rocking around a little bit gotta 
get the sea legs any specific spot to put the  
luggage brother uh we got number 17. oh 
luggage up there okay all right oh yeah
just gotta set this straight over here
number 17 that's gonna be right there 
I got the middle seat again all right  
unlucky day guys that's middle seat on 
the plane middle seat on the boat all  
right guys as you can see we are about to 
just smash right into the boat next to us  
we shall see got about an eight minute 
ride to get there and we're in Boracay
[Music]  
in here oh I got it brother we'll see if 
I got it yeah this is gonna give us the  
true test guys we're walking across oh it's a 
little shaky and we made it careful at the end
welcome to Boracay this water 
here is incredibly beautiful  
super clear and blue that's amazing all 
right now we're gonna head on down this way  
from the last step of the journey oh as you guys 
can tell I'm kind of like uh I want to be done  
with this multiple means of transportation this 
is taking taking a bit of time so probably next  
time I'll go on my own and uh you know the 
next time I'm in Boracay and let you guys  
know the difference in a future video but I 
think it's going to be much faster when you  
coordinate all the transportation on your 
own because there's just a lot of queuing  
up and waiting for all the other passengers 
on the uh same sort of like shuttle service  
and that really added a lot of time oh we got 
a little party going on when we walk in Denton
ATM right here that's good news we can get 
some cash all right we got to figure out  
which one's gonna take us to hunt on Regency 
all right we have located our bus come on
all right thank you
and we're gonna hop right in 
here all right this is our last  
mode of transportation and then we're heading 
on Regency so guys we're almost to the uh Hanan  
Regency and yeah it took a little bit longer 
basically the flight landed around 8 A.M and  
it is about 9:42. so basically I'll make 
it to the hotel by 10 left the uh place in  
Manila around I think what was like 4:15-4:30. 
so it took a lot more time than you'd expect  
you know when you keep in mind it's only one 
hour flight to get down here but uh you know  
we still have the entire day ahead of us so I'm 
happy about that all right you guys can see how  
tight it is driving in the Philippines here we've 
got uh it doesn't get any tighter than that wow
the definition of driving in Boracay 
wow hey what's going on brother
look at this wow skills right 
there kuya and on this side
wow we made it all right and 
this looks like Hanan Regency
thank you
hello good morning how are you all right
