Tom Yum as in Tom Yum Soup!?
DANG THIS IS CALAMANSI
I love Filipino food
Gotta keep eating
I understand why people love this
Have you ever had instant noodle outside Korea?
I’ve tried Thai cup noodle
and also Filipino and Japan
I’ve tried one in Thai.. and it was delicious
maybe I’ve had good ones only
Today we’ll try instant noodles from all around the world!
Woo ramen
- I crush ramen all the time
- you do?
I’ve had ramen yesterday
and day before yesterday
been craving ramen three days straight
Korea’s main ramen
It’s our pride
SON is the ambassador of this brand
that’s right
shall we?
lemme show you how we Koreans slurp
wow
you might become one of the ambassador as well
Here’s your napkin
Will you wipe it for me?
I think this ramen is ready
why is this provoking me?
There’s nothing else to say
THIS IS TASTY
This comes straight up to our mind
when we think of Korean ramen
It’s our signature
you are absolutely right
Then let’s see if any other ramen could beat Shin Ramyun
Alright, let’s do it
MAMA~
MAMA~
Shrimp Tom Yum
Tom Yum as in Tom Yum Soup!?
Tom Yum as in Tom Yum Soup!?
oh gosh I don’t like Tom Yum
HAHAHA
Oh no
This smell though
sawadikap~
I see shrimp in this Shrimp Tom Yum
I’ll try the noodle first
How is it?
I don’t like this
I don’t like this
It’s got all kinds of taste such as 
unfreshness, sour, and sweet
and they taste more weird cuz it’s hot
and they taste more weird cuz it’s hot
I’m so unfamiliar with this taste
so I tend to keep eating it
whaaaat?
It’s not tasty! It’s just peculiar
*pause*
Ok, I don’t want to slurp this food
How would you rate this?
1.5
woo generous
You have to keep in mind we’ve never tried Tom Yum b4
I’m giving 0 point
- I think I’m being too generous
- ZERO POINT
Mi goreng!
so which country is this from!?
This is Mi Goreng from Indonesia
Indonesia is known for Nasi goreng and Mi goreng
Just by looking at this package, 
it looks like junk food to me
This is the best selling instant ramen in the world
Forget what I just said
- This goes first place!?
- It’s not Shin Ramyun!?
I’m excited
Let me show you all what it looks like
You’re getting me excited
*!!!!!!!!!!!!!*
Best reaction so far!!!
It tastes like soy sauce but
but in a fancy way
Let’s see how this one tastes like
I love this sweet and sour combined flavor
and I bet all ppl will love this
I understand why people love this
Can I be real honest?
You don’t like it!?!?
I just don’t know what this tastes like
It’s very bland that it tastes like it’s not cooked very well
I want to rate this with high points
4.8!!!!
WOW!!!
TWO!
I’m giving this a 3.5
I just don’t know what’s so special about this
that’s what makes this special!
*!?!?!?*
DANG THIS IS CALAMANSI
I had this last time!!!!
this is a calamansi ramen
Ramen + Calamansi...?
I’ve only had calamansi when I’m on diet
I love Filipino food so I’ll try this much
I love Filipino food so I’ll try this much
He’s so intimidated by the smell
He’s going to spit it out soon
Since it’s a noodle w/o soup, the texture is very jiggly
and it looks like all the soup is inside the noodle
Just tell me you like it or not
I personally don’t like it but I get why you become a fan
This flavoring just punches you in the face right away
THIS IS LEMON!
but once you chew it, 
you can discover what’s so good about this
*nervous laugh*
Keep eating, keep eating!!
This is the only reaction we can do
as soon as you put this in your mouth,
something is totally wrong
There are variety of flavors in Pancit Canton
Original ones are good
but why did you give us this flavor
mean producers huh
this one’s 0.7
It’s just my personal opinion
this one’s 1.1
So this one’s better than Tom Yum huh?
NEGATIVE TEN!
OH YES! PHO!!!
Pho Bo?
Do you like rice noodles?
dang I love rice noodles!
This brand is really famous
All Vietnamese ppl were eating this
It’s also in our convenient store
- I KNEW IT!!!
- woo I didn’t know that
I’ve never seen it
if you look at the drawing here there’s lime and all
It look exactly like what’s in Vietnam
You’ve been there!?
...no
oh ok, moving on
Oh, I see small pieces of food in this noodle
It looks exactly like foods served at a restaurant
You can see small pieces of meat in here haha
Compare the size with the drawing here
exaggerated advertising
That’s a big no no!
Shall we?
You should go first this time
Woo that looks good to me!
and it smells good
It tastes very plain and clean
and I think this could be a good midnight snack
sorry to say this but it kinda tastes like a dishwasher soap
How do you know what that tastes like
It just goes in to your mouth when you’re cleaning
*Acting it out*
It tastes exactly the same
I think it’s because of the cilantro
woo trying to savor the taste
Seasoning ain’t that strong and the soup is nice and hot
Overall it’s good!!
I love this!
This is a perfect hangover food
I’m giving this 3 points
- 4.2
- wow!
So far this one’s my type-
FOUR!
For me this is a...
ONE!!!!
I personally don’t like rice noodles
Now you’ll receive so much hate
Haters come to me, I’ll cook the best Shin Ramyun to you
Japanese instant noodles!!!!
- This is really popular
- It is!?
This is a Nissin Cup Noodle
and it’s curry and original flavor
Oh my goodness just look at this!!!
This shrimp grabbed my attention!!!
This one’s huge!
Look at those pulps
lemme try the soup first
but this soup is amazing!!!!!
IT’S SO GOOD!!!!!!
Tastes of irasshaimase
That’s what I was thinking
It’s all in my head
irasshaimase!!!!!!!
It’s not that tasty...
our opinions never match girl
It’s good
The noodles were quite unfreshing 
in Filipino and Thailand noodles
but this one’s refreshing
- I’ll try the curry flavor first
- I’m quite excited
Oh man, I bet I’ll get fat
I just gulped my saliva
He’s loving it!!!
IT’S SO GOOD!!!!!!
I want to put rice in here.. you know what I mean?
gosh ofc I know!!!
Oh I like this curry flavor
This flavor is delicious
there’s also potato in here
and it’s huge
I would absolutely buy this
but I kinda want to eat this with kimchi
This is a 4.5
I absolutely loved this
this curry flavor was a bit salty to me
mom will scold at me if I eat this
so it’s a three
I’ll give two out of three!
Nothing can beat Shin ramyun
I love Korea
I think this ramen won..
This is better than Shin!?
This is a 4.5 to me
Shin Ramyun and Nissin won the battle
whaaaat
I think Vietnamese Pho was the best
I think Vietnamese Pho was the best
It stays in my mind for a long time,
so I think I’ll eat this one day
It stays in my mind for a long time,
so I think I’ll eat this one day
Shin Ramyun!!!!
You both chose Shin!
Not me..though..
I think Nissin curry flavor was the best!!!
That was just too good!
wwyd if one of New Jeans member asked you to eat this?
*DIVE IN*
