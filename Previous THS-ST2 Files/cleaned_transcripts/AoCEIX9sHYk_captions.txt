snotty this is one of the presents that
i have given my husband last christmas
yes you heard it right it was one of the
process i gave to my husband he actually
gave me one as well
but it's in the wash at the moment and
because he's still at work so i decided
to put it on because i'm feeling a
little bit chilly um
but yeah so
this is a snoddy that i got from amazon
it's actually absolutely beautiful and
lightweight i think some calls this
a snuggle hoodie um but in primark it's
called snoddy for some reason but yeah
it's nice and comfy but anyway again
happy new year everyone i hope you had a
wonderful celebration and how was your
christmas i've just realized actually
i've not uploaded a single video since

bit manic a bit hectic last christmas
cause christmas eve this one had to go
to the vet but he is okay now he's
absolutely fine so anyway i decided to
have a little rest as well and um i was
feeling a little bit under the weather
as well so i decided to listen to my
body and give myself a little rest but
anyway we are back now it's a brand new
year it's a brand new chance to be
better and things can only get better
from here isn't it but yes so we had a
lovely christmas it's just the three of
us after his vet visit we've decided to
pop into a couple of shops including the
asian shops nearby this is where we get
our
filipino stuff

and yeah they sell a lot of indian and
thai stuffs but they also stock
filipino items
so yeah

let's photo this bibinka
um this ube
um
they're well stocked at the moment hey
um
coconut sugar
look at me
this is the hot dog here it's similar to
um
it's similar it it looks like pure foods
but they're called mandis but they're
actually made in europe yeah they are
they are
actually this is made in the uk made in
the uk yeah yeah but it does look like
the pure foods
you know i don't think this is going to
defrost
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
and what is this
[Music]
and the pig's inners and some blood
so yeah that's what i normally get some
of my asian supplies or sometimes i go
to another shop
it's a chinese shop and then sometimes
we go to a friend um friends small
filipino shop as well but this time
since this one is closer to the vet we
decided to pop in there on the way home
i grabbed a couple of things from there
i decided to pick up
a pack of noodles this is what we call
bihon in philippines this is actually
this one is made of starch ah well
cornstarch this is one of my favorite
noodles all the vermicelli and order
noodles picked up a piatos this is a
typical
filipino crisps
cheese flavor
another one is boy bawang
cornick hot garlic flavor this is a corn
snacks
this is like you know your rice krispies
so it's rice that's been puffed up but
this is made of corn i love this one and
it's garlic flavor i also pick up sugar
palm which is this is what we call kaom
um we normally put it in a fruit salad
because i was thinking i was gonna make
fruit salad for new year's eve um
but since i forgot to do the whole
before then i completely forgot it's
still here i made a fruit salad but i
didn't put this including
including this
a jackfruit this is a
jackfruit in syrup
all right jackfruit
it's lovely lovely and sweet put to mix
this one is actually a yeah it's a
steamed cupcake basically
with um
slightly melted
cheese on top this one is just the dry
mixture all i had to do really is just
mix water in it that one i picked that
every time because steve sometimes would
ask for pouto so i'll just make him a
small batch and um he's a happy
happy chap after that
spaghetti sauce rich and thick
filipino-style spaghetti sauce you're
probably thinking what's the difference
between that and our spaghetti sauce in
the uk
big difference because this this is
slightly sweeter
slightly sweeter and slightly sweet
having said that i don't like the really
sweet filipino spaghetti sauce so i
usually dilute this i i would normally
add tomato paste in it so it gives it a
little bit of a tanginess
um i don't like too sweet one oh i
bought this sardines i've already this
is mega sardines i just missed the taste
of it this is actually two in a pack and
i've already used one because i was
after christmas celebration i you know
there was a lot of food left over and i
thought i just wanted something that's
quite basic so i opened one already
before i could even do the whole and
then i realized i was running out of
fish sauce but anyway this is gonna last
me quite a while so i don't have to
worry about that in the next god knows
how many months so and then
oh my god this is fish snack i didn't
realize she couldn't oh this is not what
i thought it is anyway this is
dried fish i thought this is the same as
what we got in philippines um
but this is a thai one
and not taiwan but
thai
um snack fish snacks i didn't realize
it's a fish snack i thought it's one of
those things that like in philippines
you deep fry and then you eat it with
with rice but anyway i'm still going to
try it but probably not when the husband
is home and i need to cook it outside if
it needs to be cooked but since it says
it is fish snack so it means it's
already cooked
we'll see oh i also got this all around
scad one kilogram this is 4.99 and this
is usually what we call galonggong in
philippines
um
and then
spicy chicken pranks this one is 129 for
the husband and i also picked up tender
juicy hot dog
jumbo
it doesn't look that jumbo really
because i'm pretty sure in philippines
jumbo is really like almost double this
size but anyway i missed the taste of
hot dog anyway so i picked this one
oh yes i also picked up this the coupon
spicy baguong bagong is a sauteed shrimp
this one is already cooked so i normally
use this as a dip for any um
like raw mango that i buy from morrisons
like the green raw mango it's lovely to
be dipped in it but like any other
filipino food it's usually um
an acquired taste so if you're not so
used to that taste you're probably gonna
find it quite disgusting but for those
that have tasted it before and like us
we were brought up with it there's
actually like heaven i missed pancit
canton so much that i actually grabbed
four of them two of each flavor one is
calamansi which is citrus
and the other one is the hot chili
flavor
so that's all i've got from this asian
shop that we popped into when we got
home we only had really a very simple
christmas eve i just made some migraine
from scratch
i've made it before in the past and we
always enjoyed it but this time it was
more special because i paired it with
lovely rib eye steak
ribeye steak for me and it was lamb
steak for my husband and we absolutely
well and truly enjoyed it it was just
either that
or we were just really hungry because we
had a such a long day out with this boy
but oh yeah we really enjoyed it that
was our simple christmas eve whereas in
philippines i was imagining a big
celebration in philippines usually it's
christmas eve so at midnight but anyway
since we are in the uk
we also the traditional english
christmas and obviously christmas day is
the big day so i i cooked a small turkey
for me and the husband we had a slow
roast leg of lamb as well to go with it
we had sausage i couldn't really make
pigs in blanket because the husband
don't eat pork or can't eat pork so the
sausage i prepared was turkey sausage it
was actually nice as well and i sauteed
the brussels sprouts in a little bit of
that
sausage meat it was absolutely lovely
garlic
sausage meat and brussels sprout and it
was absolutely yummy even the husband
really enjoyed it and then the usual
roast potatoes roasted carrots with a
little bit of honey and then the usual
um christmas day opening presents it was
just really lovely oh yeah while i was
cooking i was so busy in the kitchen i
thought everything got really quiet in
the lounge i thought i wonder what
happened to the two of them the music
was playing
and lo and behold
when i looked what was happening in the
lounge this is what i saw
oh
poor things they must have been really
shattered i mean
i felt sorry for them in a way
especially in the husband i felt quite
sorry for him
but um i just couldn't help you i had to
take a little clip of it because there i
was in the kitchen so busy trying to get
the meal done and then he was having a
good sleep he had a good one hours sleep
and i i let him so that was our little
christmas um celebration and it was
absolutely lovely and we totally enjoyed
it the next day none of it was wasted
because i made two dishes out of the
leftover rose turkey from the day before
so boxing day we had turkey curry it was
absolutely lovely and the other dish i
made braised turkey rest assured none of
those meat was wasted i promise you
um but yeah we totally
utterly and absolutely enjoyed it it was
really a nice lovely time it's a lovely
break because it was like four days off
from work
you know because the monday tuesday was
a bank holiday and um it was just a
lovely
day
it was just a lovely break mini break
put it that way
this is a lovely
cranberry is quite nice
[Music]
it separates the taste
that's my boy's christmas dinner roast
turkey carrots and brussel sprouts
