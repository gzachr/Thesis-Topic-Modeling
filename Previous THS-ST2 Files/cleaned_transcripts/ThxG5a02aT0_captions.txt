topsolog which i'm excited yeah i can't wait this  
thing smell this smell i don't know which 
one it is but something here smells delicious  
and disclaimer before we get into the food please

pronunciation we have missed please politely  
let us know in the comments below just so we know 
we have no trouble with english so yeah we're not  
that's great so please yeah let us know yeah so 
tagalog you mean tagalog so just let us know um  
and like always let us know if there's anything 
else you want to see us try but without that look  
after all that i am hungry i'm sure there are 
dudes that's what i wanted to say yes so which  
do you guys want to try first crispy pata or 
tap salon let's do the powder the crusty paddock
i was not expecting this i mean i read the 
description yeah you did new phone who dis  
clearly he doesn't know how to work his 
name i was not expecting it to look like  
this obviously i read the description 
and i was like okay cool but this is wow  
ready what the heck oh wow look at the size of 
that thing that's a massive leg it's a big phone  
before we get any further i'm just gonna read the 
actual internet description of what the crispy  
patta is crispy pata is one of the most common 
filipino dishes served on special occasions it  
consists of a whole pork leg that is cooked 
until tender it is then dried and deep fried  
until golden brown and crispy the leg is usually 
cooked alongside various spices such as bay leaves  
and peppercorns so this bad boy is dried and 
then deep fried it looks good look you can  
see look how crispy that thing looks this i'm 
expecting a nice pepper flavor on this giant  
thing it probably doesn't look as big on camera 
as it actually is like it's it's huge huge that's  
a big bone 15.99 in canadian dollars it's just 
it's also like really thick like yeah like the  
underside of it there's a big chunk of meat on 
there now from what we learned in our first video  
rice is most definitely life so we got some ice 
a big old bowl yes so i guess you just rip and  
tear and pull it yeah you just cut it up and eat 
it so we got some plates uh and also this is the  
um sauce that you put on it can you pass the 
plates no they're all for me okay what we'll  
do i guess is just i don't know if you want to 
dish out some rice on your plate because you gotta  
eat everything with rice i love white rice though 
it's so good it's nice and sticky basic white rice  
it's coming out like a solid piece now some 
of the comments again i refer back refer back  
to the comments because there's that that's what 
we learned that's where we get all our knowledge  
on people we'll never hesitate to tell us what 
we should or shouldn't do which is awesome but  
yeah it's more of like we know like we didn't know 
rice was such a huge staple and rice's life is all  
over the comments yeah so we definitely are going 
to embrace that so it's kind of like beef jerky  
type of well that's just like the skin i think is 
it yeah but look at that bone oh wow look at that  
meat get ripped off there off the bone better 
that's just like the skin you got to dig into  
there there's underneath you're still going to 
skin the skin i think yeah i know remember there  
it is look at that oh underneath there look at 
that oh nice man look at that meat there oh my  
god there you go look at that yes oh baby this 
looks okay so we have to have a little bit of this  
the little saucy stuff yep so that'll lead us to 
our first fun fact of today's video fun fact time
crispy patta it is traditionally rubbed 
with a spice mixture before it's fried  
served sliced it is often accompanied by pickled 
papaya and a tart sauce which combines vinegar  
soy sauce and a variety of spices you know you 
can definitely smell the vinegar this is the  
tart sauce oh yeah oh it smells good you 
can smell it all right guys wrong i cannot  
not use my hand let's dig in let's just 
eat the rice like this here's everybody  
wow that's so vinegary
guys i'm just gonna eat the rice with 
my hands because apparently that's okay  
mmm a little bit of a sour taste of the 
vinegar yeah you're really ready for the crunch  
that's pretty crunchy oh my god the skin is 
it good holy crap get the crunchy skin like  
i'm gonna be a hundred percent honest visually 
looking at this i was like wow obviously it's dry  
it's like doesn't look very like it's juicy 
no but it's the crispy parts are the best part  
oh yeah that skin is fantastic oh my god that 
pork is so tender and juicy it's delicious i  
love the that sauce is really good too because 
it is vinegary but it's not over pound oh man  
i love this sauce that's probably my favorite 
thing and the rice is just i see why they eat  
everything with rice because the rice is nice it 
kind of absorbs the sauce a bit you guys ready
there's a serious crunch oh my god then it's 
soaked the skin is super crispy but the meat  
is nice and tender and i love the crispiness 
of this did you get a crispy piece i did whoa  
super delicious i'm just going to use my fingers 
for the rice because it's sticky and i'm going  
to dip it in my leftover sauce it goes so good 
in the sauce like the rice soaks up everything  
it kind of reminds me of the skin on 
it when you have a pig roast but this  
is even more because this is actually 
deep fried does not just cook at all man  
they nailed it crispy on the outside juicy 
in the middle delicious on this sauce i want  
to make like i need to bottle this oh wait what's 
that sauce oh it's for the other stuff yeah sorry  
i said another thing well that's a good segue eric 
i was going to say that let's probably say to the  
next item i want to try this other thing all right 
this other thing let's uh clear it up and get to  
the second one all right we have one more food 
item to try which i am actually most excited to  
try this one based on this one sounds interesting 
just from the description peeking over kelly's  
shoulder reading it that sounds really good so 
tapas log that's it one word tapas log capsule  
absolutely taps the log i always say topless 
song but it's taps the s is before the l the
also please correct us if we're pronouncing it 
wrong because we have canadian eyes there's a  
very good chance that we're saying this wrong 
um basically it is just beef fried rice and egg  
when you get when i hear egg i think breakfast 
but i don't think this is a breakfast item it is  
a breakfast item oh is it yeah it is actually 
already no but it is a common breakfast item  
also i was reading on the internet too which i you 
know it's the internet so don't don't come at me  
if i'm wrong but you know in the philippines it 
is also a very popular dish for the youngins who  
like to go out and have a little too much fun they 
have a late night so it's like you come home from  
the bars you have some taps to log that's right it 
helps the hangovers all right let's see this thing  
whoa oh my holy mother that is so much rice is 
that an egg underneath the meat too so we have egg  
here okay it looks like it's friday friday we have 
fried egg here looks like a hard yolk we have the  
rice yup and oh my gosh this beef smells so good 
look at that i thought the egg might be in the  
rice not literally on top of it on top uh for this 
this dish here it's 10.99 which is fair for like  
a full-size meal like it seems like it's for one 
person yeah yeah that's a lot of rice so holy crap  
i don't think i can eat all that rice on my own no 
way i'm just gonna add some scoop of rice and it  
looks like there's some like eggy yolk on it as i 
said you want to like dig into that egg on top see  
if you can like smoosh it around a bit oh should 
i crack the egg oh it's a soft that's a soft deal  
i can see how this is good having too much 
fun recovery yeah oh yeah so while you guys  
are dishing that out how about i do a fun fact 
so this is actually a really interesting fun  
fact and this kind of makes this dish 
even more fun for me i don't know why  
topsail log in tagalog is a mixture of 
three different food items tap for tapa  
which is a fried beef marinated in vinegar 
and garlic c for cine gang sinigang which  
is a simple garlic fried rice and log for it 
log which means egg so they took the bits of  
all three words and put it into one so tapas 
tops a log i think that's pretty fun i like it  
all right you guys we are going to dig in try and 
get a bite of everything yeah yeah there we go and  
i feel like this egg yolk on this rice is going 
to be like amazeballs i think so cheers everybody  
we're gonna mix up the the beef and the egg here 
in one shot we're already on our second bite  
we couldn't caught up oh that's really good 
now the beef is a little more vinegary than  
i was expecting it to be wow yeah a totally 
different flavor than the the it is the powder  
that fried egg in that beef together tastes so 
good really really good i can see how this is a  
popular breakfast dish or a hangover recovery 
dish and the vinegar on the beef is delicious  
i think it breaks down that meat nicely makes 
it so tender i'm a little on the fence with the  
vinegary flavor of the meat but that brings me 
to my second fun fact exactly what is the tapa  
what's on the meat let's find out because it's 
fantastic ready so tapa is dried or cured beef  
mutton venison or horse meat although other meat 
or even fish may be used filipinos prepare tapa  
by using thin slices of meat and curing these 
with salt and spices as a preservation method  
because you know what this really kind of flavor 
reminds me of the cans of mussels you get really
in yeah because that's what i 
think it's a preservative but it's  
man it's fantastic it's really really 
good this heater is juicy it's delicious
the egg i love egg the egg's nice because it you 
know you can't really taste it like it gets mixed  
in with everything else but it's nice yeah that 
egg and the rice that's good i'm gonna be i'm  
gonna be honest i know i've said that a lot of 
times but just so everybody knows i'm honest  
i like the meat it's not my favorite meat i've 
tried out of the different filipino dishes we've  
had no i definitely had these ones i definitely 
prefer the uh crispy pancakes crispy pada meat was  
better to me like this is still good but i really 
like the crispy powder and i also like the adobo  
yeah i wonder if i could take crispy powder and 
put that with the egg i mean you guys could do  
bacon in it like bacon and eggs but anyways 
i agree i think that crispy powder was my  
favorite dish of the stuff today it's weird 
because i kind of like this dish but i like  
that meat more i don't know it's weird it's insane 
taking the potato and put it with the uh taps log  
yeah yeah you definitely do that i don't know yeah 
they were they were both really good though like  
and just totally different types of food too than 
what we're used to i'm pleasantly surprised with  
this i'm gonna say that i thought everything was 
delicious uh really the tap snow the crispy powder  
definitely for me was the better dish just because 
the meat was so juicy and the skin was so crispy  
and delicious on that on the pork leg yeah by far 
that's one of my favorite the favorite thing i've  
tried today yeah like i said i don't think i could 
pick a favorite because i bow like both parts  
parts of both of them but i would eat them both 
again oh yeah so 100 i would definitely have  
these both of them but i would definitely 100 
go to the crispy paddock is that the skin on it  
it's amazing it's so crispy but underneath it that 
layer of fat underneath there is so like delicious
