Hi to you Rafał Baran from SzukającPrzygody.pl
and today I have another episode for you in which
I will answer your questions that you ask in the comments
I collected the list of such questions again
and today I'll just answer it
I invite you
today is Saturday, May 16
I have a weekend that I wanted to spend with my family but
but I decided to break out for 2 hours
record another episode for you
today I will only answer your questions
I collected such questions that
they are not suitable for the episode because
too little information
this episode just too short to last
that's why I answer these questions every now and then
just in a movie like today
at the beginning I would like to thank everyone who supports
my Vlog, mine and Christine really
because she became more and more interested in it
thank you to all Patronite "om
for your support and just as you have probably noticed
every movie that is coming out now is already with English subtitles
and for the future maybe some other subtitles
we will see, we will try to prepare it for you
so everything is going in the right direction for now
so let's begin
here I have a list of printed questions
which I collected for today's episode
Of course, these are not all questions
some of the questions you ask me
in the comments, as I wrote in the comments, I will most likely be
these questions will be separate episodes because I think they are so interesting
and also thank you for your ideas
that it's worth recording a completely separate episode on this topic
and gather more information
those questions that are here are only short, therefore
I will answer them quickly
OK, we're going with the topic
"You mentioned that when you went to the Philippines you could not speak English, today you rather speak fluent
tell in more detail, how did you study, how much time did you devote to study? "
yes, I admit it when I went to the Philippines 5 years ago
I hardly spoke English at all
Of course, I understood English, as probably most of you
by watching movies, by listening
by reading IT documentation
which I just had to read in English
but I was ashamed to speak
it's always so Polish that we
we are ashamed to speak in english
because we think we have to be perfectionists about something
to make a fame, listen it is not
I remember that when I flew to the Philippines
I bought a set
so-called flashcards, i.e. cards
one side was Polish, the other side was English
and I even wanted a word, because
because I wasn't sure if my English is at this level,
to get along
my sister remember that she was laughing at me then
she said, listen, why are you going to the Philippines like
You can't really say anything in English
so it was
I came to the Philippines
and I had to start a conversation somehow
I immediately broke and started talking
in English, of course it was such a hurting of this language
It was bad
but in time I came to this
for this practice, I did not have to use this language, I had no other option
so I started to remember it faster
what, what I heard from others
I also remember that when I lived in for the first time with
already in a private home with Natalia and Robert
they just came back from China
where they were English teachers
and when we lived together
they promised me that listen at home
we will speak in English because it's normal for us
and at least you will learn
it wasn't really that way, because of course we talked in Polish, because it was easier
but what I did then, I often met with
other foreigners
who also lived on the island of Siquijor
and I just listened to them
I remember a few people told me that I was the perfect listener
because I can listen, sit, I do not interrupt
that was the truth, because I was simply afraid to speak English
well, but with time I came to that
that English, simply
became normal for me
and basically it looked like that
it wasn't anything complicated in my opinion
the habit of having to use this language
I didn't go to any school, I didn't take any extra lessons
I thought it was unnecessary
just practice, practice and practice again
and just listening to this language
it allowed that
so that you will learn it simply faster
"What's up with Marych? Is he still working in the capital? Because I saw that he was missing"
this question is about Marcin
the nickname Marych, so called by everyone
this is Marcin and Monika from
Poluzuj.pl blog
they had previously lived on Bantayana, then moved to Siquijor
and together we had a joint project
the one with the kids movie theater "Kids Movie Night"
so it happened, Marych and Monika moved to Manila
and there they now work in a corporation at CallCenter
as far as I know, because we talk quite often
everything is OK, well they live in CezonCity,
where there are now most cases of Coronavirus
I can't say more because it's really theirs
private life, and that's probably why they write less, speak less
blog is actually dying slowly
because they have nothing to write about, they only work
but listen if you're interested in such an episode
what this work looks like
in Manila on CallCenter
probably how much you can earn, what life looks like
and what recruitment looks like
so write me in the comment
and I will gladly contact Monika and Marcin
and ask them to record such an episode with me
but I have to have your information
that something like that would interest you
"Recently, a lot of Polish businesses in the Philippines. You could name the ones you know, come from hearing. Where are they, what they do, and even provide links to them"
Ok, listen, there are a lot of Polish businesses in the Philippines
I obviously don't know everyone
but of those that come to my mind right now
that's for sure
this is Marek and Ania who run a very nice resort in Puerto Galera
you have the link to it here
there is also Krzysiek, who runs the Dive Center in Bohol
very cool dive center
there are of course also several Poles
like Monkey Bussines - Michał on Siquijor
with Mateusz what they lead
Monkey Bussines and also run two departments
who else
also the Polish Tourist Center is now opening
on Bohol, but they don't have the pages yet
it will definitely be when they open flights again
I will definitely write about it because it will be an interesting topic
and in fact probably all those businesses that come to my mind now
if I have any other
I will meet some others, I will definitely write about it
and I will also want to record videos about it, because I think this is an interesting topic
"It used to be loud about a Polish village in the Philippines. Do you know anything about it?"
well when it comes to the Polish village in the Philippines
it's about this Arkadia project
I wrote before, and at the very beginning of this project I wrote on the blog
this is a project that was made in Palawan by one such Lord
Yes. It was very loud about this project
I do not know why
the media picked up the subject that
A Pole wants to open a Polish village in the Philippines
and sell
bamboo houses, for almost 10 times their greater value
as far as I know, this project didn't work out
I have information from several people I know about smoking that they don't even want to talk to that person
because
because they just feel a scam at it, I don't know
these are not my words
I suspect the project didn't work out, because
I think people rather understood that
what he was selling is just that
at very, very high prices
this person was also very fresh in the Philippines, he didn't know how to do business in the Philippines
what are the laws in the Philippines, as far as I know it rather died
this person was also so specific that
just all of them
they lived in the Philippines, Poles
blocked or kicked out of the group
so we really don't have a clue what's going on with this project
so it's probably enough
I don't know what more to say about it
"Local men are not pissed off that millions of men from all over the world come to the Philippines every year ....
to find a wife at best and treat the country a bit more realistically as sex tourism? "
come on listen up
if you are coming on holiday
you look at Filipinos how they react to you
you think they are really very nice
friendly, very friendly towards each other
and want to help you at all costs
they don't want any money from you, and so on
so this is the first impression, I also had the first impression
I still think there are a lot of nice Filipinos who
they will treat you equally
but unfortunately most look at you like an ATM
because he knows that you come from a country that is much more developed, much richer
and bring that money to the Philippines to spend it
so they will want to use you to some extent
it's the same with women
Well, they are looking at you as white, so you must be rich
as for the gentlemen, well they are rather
react differently to this situation
they don't want to talk about it too much
if they are your friends, they don't want to share that they are jealous
about whites, there is certainly this jealousy
they look at you like JOE, as the saying goes
everyone is from America and everyone is rich
they definitely want to be your friends because they know that you have money
only after some time does it come out who is your real friend
and who was the only one who thought he would get some money from you
I have not encountered any such unpleasant situation that
the white tourist was beaten by something like that
or that someone would attack him in some verbal way
rather they are shy
and they will not approach you like that
they will not show that
they are jealous
certainly in depth
inside they are buzzing about it
but they don't show it
"What surprised you the most in the Philippines?"
that is a very hard question
because when I came to the Philippines, it was my first time in Asia, so it was Asia
it was the end of the world for me
and basically everything surprised me here
but what I think is the most, and I still remember it today
this is the Filipinos' approach to how
how they plan their future
namely, they don't think about this future at all
they basically live from day to day
and it was a huge surprise to me that
I don't know how I always planned
plan everything, next week, next day
your savings
I can spend my budget this month
how much I will be able to spend next month
any ideas for the future
it turned out that Filipinos don't think about such things at all
and that was probably the biggest surprise for me
their approach to life
such spontaneity as they function
and it still surprises me to this day
"Which city, island do you recommend visiting the Philippines on your first visit?"
oh, hhh listen, the question is complicated because it depends on what
You expect from the Philippines
if you want to dive and this is your main goal
I recommend, for example, Malapascue, Davin, Apo Island
Siquijor is also great, of course, there are a lot of dive sites
so you can really travel for 2 weeks
navigate around 3-4 different islands
and dive in 4 different places
you will find something interesting in every place
if you think about sunbathing
and rest, some sightseeing
then you can also jump around the islands
for example, I know this region of Central Visaya very well
because I've lived here for 5 years, I'm moving in this area
and here I know what is interesting
this area is definitely very nice
Anyway, I want to prepare a movie for you
I will describe such a trip
two weeks, 2.5 weeks
around the islands how this can be organized
so definitely if you want one
to organize such beaching it is worth coming to Cebu
later get to Bohol, then Siquijor, Dumaguete and return through the island of Cebu back
so these are cool areas where you can take 3-4 days
spend in each of these places, see everything there is basically to see
at such a fast pace
and come back to Europe
so as I say, plaing: Bohol for sure, Panglao,
Siquijor, Davin -
on average in my opinion
definitely an Apo Island tour
but it can be done one day,
basically so many people ask about Palawan
Port Barton, I've never been there before
I regret it terribly, I hope to fly there this year
As Emilia grows up a little bit, we'll go there and spend at least a week there
or even longer if you succeed
so I'll be recording videos from there
and I can say what I like there
from what I heard from friends
I know that, for example: El Nido is beautiful, but it is very, very touristic
prices are awfully high compared to other places in the Philippines
where you can see the same
so that's all I can say about it for now
"Apparently, it's often too far to the hospital in the Philippines. If something happens to you, you won't be able to get there, save yourself. What do you think?"
listen, it's not quite like that
if every small island has its own hospital
Of course, this is not such an advanced hospital, it is a real one
what are the hospitals like in Dumaguete, Cebu or Manila
where is, for example: ultrasound, where is X-ray, where are other devices that can save your life
an example here is the island of Siquijor
every major town on Siquijor has its own hospital
in Larena on Siquijor, in these two cities of Siquijor City,
these are more real hospitals,
these are not hospitals that will solve your every problem,
but if you have a motorbike accident
will something happen to you like that
more temporary can be said
that's where they put you together
while there they certainly won't do you Rengen,
they won't do x-rays there
with this they will send you to the nearest normal hospital, i.e. they will tell you to go to
they will take you if the need arises by ambulance on the ferry
and you'll be in Dumaguete
if there in Dumaguete it turns out that this is again something too serious
e.g. head injury, where it is needed, I don't know what it's called
head tomography, or any other stuff there, will definitely transport you to Cebu
whether it will be a plane or whether it will be an ambulance, there are 6 hours away, you really get it too
and so it looks more or less
that's why a lot
"foreigner" that "chooses Dumaguete and not Siquijor, for example
because they want to have access to this normal hospital
they also want to have access to a normal airport
so if anything happens, they get on the first plane and fly to Manila
or to Cebu and they are within 1-2 hours they are in a really professional hospital
where they can basically do everything the same as in Europe
I also have a few older, much older friends
who do exactly that, they said that they no longer use the services of the Dumaguete hospital
only if anything feels bad already
he gets on a plane and flies, e.g. to Manila, because he knows that he has the best service there
and access to virtually every specialist, every doctor he wants
"Do you have experience with dangerous jellyfish?"
haa, dangerous jellyfish
this is a funny situation, because
a jellyfish burn
from these paws I had
only once in the last 5 years
and make it funnier
I remember it exactly because it was the first time I entered the sea
it was the second day after, the first day after my arrival in the Philippines
when I went to the beach the first day
I changed and jumped into the sea, I started swimming and
and after swimming maybe 10 meters, something just burned my whole arm
it wasn't tragic, I felt, I had such shorts on my hands
and it was the first and last time it happened to me
I remember it because I was scared and I thought if it would be like every bath in the sea
I will just break down, but it was the first and last time
I know that my friends also had some
unpleasant situations, I didn't experience it later
maybe it's about the place, maybe it's just the time of year
when these jellyfish swim more often, I do not know it because, as I say, very rarely
I heard about it, and on Siquijor
maybe I heard something like that a few times, certainly not more.
and that would be enough in this episode
I answered the most important questions I received
In addition to these questions, as I mentioned earlier, I have many other questions
but they are already suitable for an episode, for different episodes on various topics
so I will record in order, I have already prepared these topics
thank you very much, of course if you have any more questions you want to ask
please leave them in the comments
I make comments, I try to reply to all comments
and I'm also trying to record episodes on the topics you want,
because this channel is created for you
and I'm happy to ask these questions
see you in the next episode and have a nice weekend, Greetings
