- Hey guys, how's it going?
We are isolated, it's
just us two right here.
As you can see, there's
no one else around.
So what we're gonna do right now,
is we're gonna throw you backwards
so you can see exactly
where we are right now.
Are you ready for this?
And, go!
(upbeat music)
- Yay!
- All right guys, we're off
to Mount Tapyas right now
here at Coron, Philippines.
How do you feel?
- I am just so excited about this.
I can't wait to get out there.
Bring it on.
- Apparently 726 steps,
is that right?
Seven hundred and twenty-six
steps to get to the top.
Hopefully to watch the sunset.
We're on a tricycle right now.
We're off to Mount Tapyas.
Let's do this.
(upbeat music)
- I'm taking photos of her taking photos.
Like the behind the scenes
of the photos, yeah.
Smile, then.
Lovely.
(laughter)
(upbeat music)
All right my friends, 3:54
in the afternoon, 2nd of May,
at the base of Mount Tapyas
here in Coron, Philippines.
And just got dropped off by
a tuk tuk from the hotel.
We're going here and
climbing for the sunset.
And I'm not sure what time the sunset it,
maybe six, 6:30.
It's about 4:00pm now.
It's about 726 steps to the top,
and we're gonna kill this.
We're gonna kill this.
She's already, this one, Robin, slow down.
Slow down.
Seven hundred and
twenty-six steps to the top,
and apparently it's one of
the big attractions here
in Coron, Philippines.
How you doing?
Are you good?
Good? Good?
All right.
So let's get this started.
This is where we're starting.
This is the starting position right here.
And these are the steps.
And Robin's got a head start.
Are you gonna count all these steps?
All right let's go, let's go.
(upbeat music)
All right guys, we are almost 600 steps,
cause all the steps seem to have 100, 200,
step markers on the way up to the top.
We're almost 600 steps almost
to the top of Mount uh, vit,
uh...t... I've forgotten the name.
Mattaius.
What's it called again?
Mount Tipius, I think.
(laughter)
I can't remember, I'll throw it up anyway.
So we're almost to the top,
and this is the beauty that we see so far.
Sorry about the wind.
That we see so far on
the way up to the top.
Look how amazing that is.
At first I thought that
was an airport down there,
it could be.
Looks like it could be an airport.
There is an airport in Coron somewhere.
And look at that terrain.
Look how amazing that is.
Look how incredible that is.
It's just... just incredible.
(upbeat music)
All right my friends, the top
of Mount Tapyas right now.
And this is actually a great place to be
to get a good view of the city of Coron
and the main city centre.
So what I'll do, although
this you should see.
This is the lookout area.
The sun is over there about to set,
maybe in about an hour,
two hours from now.
The lookout area is here,
and then down through
there is the city of Coron.
Right there.
And you'll probably see
the signage here right?
That says Coron.
A little bit like Hollywood,
the Hollywood sign.
So it's like Coron's version of Hollywood.
But yeah, actually if
you look straight ahead
at where my finger's
pointing, that's the port.
So when you're getting a ferry to Coron,
that's where you'll pull into.
And so, yeah, that's the little city.
That's the city of Coron right there.
You see all those hills in the background.
Pretty amazing.
And if you just hold on
with me just a second.
And then we're gonna get the drone out.
And give you a good aerial
perspective of this place
with the drone.
Before we do that, I'm
gonna bring this lovely
young lady into it.
How do you feel?
Instagraming away, can't
help yourself can you?
(laughter)
- Ah, it's just insanely beautiful.
[Brad] - It's amazing huh?
- It's insanely beautiful.
[Brad] - Yeah.
It's not a bad place to come
if you're short on time,
you have half a day here in Coron,
you just come up here for the sunset.
- Couple hours to kill for
us and look where we are.
[Brad] - Yeah those this is
literally a fifteen minute
tricycle ride and about 30
minutes to climb the 721 steps.
(upbeat music)
Guys, check this out.
The top of the mountain.
Robin has found a track.
How cool is this?
Wow, man this is awesome.
Hey guys.
This is awesome, I love this.
Guys, privacy.
There's nobody else except...us.
Amazing.
We can sit and watch the sunset together.
Private sunset experience.
(inspirational music)
This one right here,
playing model for somebody
else's photographs.
Right?
I didn't capture that.
That would've been fun to capture though.
Robin's just sitting there
and these guys are like,
"Hey, don't move, don't move,
we want you in the photo."
And she's posing for them.
(laughter)
So funny.
Anyway, so...
(laughter)
- It's all so bizarre.
- She loves it.
What girl wouldn't love
that attention, seriously?
Man, all right.
(upbeat music)
[Brad] - She's coming, she's coming,
she's coming, she's coming.
(whinnying)
(laughter)
- Yes?
- All right, yeah.
(laughter)
She's here.
That's why we get along so well.
She's a little bit loopy, like me.
- Woohoo.
- That's right.
High on life baby.
High on life.
- That's me.
- Okay, so we're still
at the top of this hill.
What's this hill called, I
keep forgetting the name of it?
Mount?
[Robin] - Me too, I'm sorry.
- Tapyas.
I think it is.
We'll throw it up on the screen.
We'll throw it up on
the screen, it's okay.
You saw the drone produce before.
This lovely young lady.
Strolling with freedom.
That was nice.
- It was amazing.
- It was good footage huh?
I thought it was.
We're leaving.
- We're leaving this.
- We're leaving the viewpoint
at the top of this mountain.
We're off to the hot springs.
Apparently the hot springs
are really good here.
So, we're gonna go check it out.
Right now.
(laughter)
All right, that was funny.
All right.
- Five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, yay!
One more?
- All right folks, walking down the stairs
from Mount Tipin, Tipias,
whatever it's called.
(laughter)
And I never get the name right.
Even though, even though
ten people have told me
what it's called I keep forgetting it.
Tipias. Mount Tipias.
Anyway, so we're walking down the stairs
but it's 5:30.
Everyone's getting ready for the sunset
and there's like, I shit you not,
there are like thousands, maybe hundreds.
Exaggerating a little bit.
Hundreds of people walking
up and, mostly up the stairs,
for the sunset.
Check this out.
So, we were here maybe an hour ago,
and there was nobody up here.
Nobody.
Is that right?
Nobody.
Except us.
- I'm actually just...
I'm striking to your phone,
cause I'm just so moved at how beautiful.
- She's on a different...
- I'm sensitive.
- She's on a different cloud.
She's on a different cloud.
[Robin] - It's crowded.
[Brad] - It's crowded.
(upbeat music)
