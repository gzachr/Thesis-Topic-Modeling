Islands, tropical fruits and a lot of fish
and seafood.
These are the gifts God has granted this country
of more than 7,000 islands.
And all of their creative chefs have managed
to turn all of them into the tastiest delicacies
you’re ever going to experience.
Welcome to Top 10 World. Let’s look at the Top 10 Filipino Dishes You Must Try!
10.
Bulalo
Even though some of you can’t stand heat
on top of heat, you’ll change your mind
once you try this local delicacy.
The broth for the Bulalo is made from freshly
slaughtered Batangas beef, that’s been boiled
for hours.
All of the bones and spices in which the meat
has been cooking make this dish irresistible.
And usually, it’s served with, beef, corn
and cabbage.

Chicken Inasal
Grilled chicken?
Pass!
But wait on a minute.
There’s something you don’t really know.
This dish is made by letting the chicken sit
in a special marinade.
It’s made from lemongrass, calamansi, salt,
pepper and garlic.
The entire chicken, along with the heart,
liver and gizzard are grilled and served with
a hefty portion of garlic rice.
Just to die for!
8.
Arroz Caldo
Manila prides itself on this thick soup.
There are a lot of restaurants that serve
this dish, so what’s it made of?
We’re glad you asked.
Arroz Caldo is salty rice porridge that’s
very thick and has pieces of chicken throughout.
Some restaurants use green onions, toasted
garlic and a hard- boiled egg as part of the
dish.
7.
Crispy Pata
Even though some might run away from it, this
is an absolute delicacy in the Philippines.
What chefs do is they SMASH THAT LIKE BUTTON
IF YOU HAVEN’T DONE SO ALREADY, BUT in reality,
they take the pork leg/ knuckle and they boil
it with some spices.
Then they deep-fry the tender meat until the
skin is crispy and delicious.
Served with the special sauce made from vinegar,
soy sauce and chilly, this one is finger lickin’
good!
6.
Tapa
If you’re looking for a filling breakfast,
look no further.
Dried marinated beef, fried eggs and a giant
serving of rice.
That’s what you’ll find almost all across
the Philippines.
The locals eat it in the morning and many
vendors sell it all the time!
5. Lechon
There’s not much to say about this one.
It’s an entire pig that’s been split roasted
on some coals until the skin is golden-brown
and crispy.
It’s a bit on the expensive side, but you’re
going to see it to all the parties and social
gatherings.
There’s rarely a party that can go without
it!
4. Sisig
Sisig is what happens when you don’t want
to waste a single part of the pig.
The chefs make this amazing appetized by combining
onions, chilly peppers, calamansi, pig head
and liver.
They fry all of these together and what you’re
left with is an amazing appetizer that’s
just begging to be taken down with a cold,
frothy beer.
If you’re not into eating it as is, you
can add some hot sauce and take it down!
3.
Kamaro
If you thought this dish looks like it’s
been made from bugs… you’d be right.
But before you turn off this video, let us
tell you how this delicacy is prepared.
It’s made from mole crickets who’ve had
their wings and legs removed.
The only thing left is their moist body.
Now, in order to make them taste good, chefs
cook them in vinegar and garlic.
Afterwards, they drain the bugs and fry them
in oil, onion and tomatoes until their exterior
becomes crispy.
It’s one the best appetizers you can find.
2.
Balut
The only reason this Filipino delicacy is
not in not our top pick is because it’s
not an actual dish.
It’s more like a snack.
And you know what it is?
It’s a 14- year old egg embryo that’s
been boiled.
If you go to the Philippines, you can find
them being sold by street vendors… and it’s
said to improve your sex life… even though
it doesn’t look all that appetizing.
1.
Adobo
Did you think we’d forget to mention this
one here?
This is one dish that no Filipino household
can go without.
The cook usually cooks the meat in vinegar,
salt, garlic, pepper, soy sauce, and every
other spice your greedy little heart desires.
This way, they preserve the meat without refrigeration.
If you want to experience this dish to the
fullest, you should go to a Filipino family
and have someone cook it for you.
You won’t regret it!
