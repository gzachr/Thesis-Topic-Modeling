hi guys! usually when we celebrate the
birthdays of our kids here at home we
set two dates one to invite friends from
school and another day to invite family
typically we prepare a light snack with
cake and drinks especially if we
schedule after school for example like
this year we have them decorate their
own cupcakes and that also helps keep
them busy and entertained
and of course the kids always look
forward to the opening of gifts and
maybe having some games and free play
afterwards
we usually try out different things when
serving our family and friends on
birthday parties. Barbecue is very common
and we've also done Mexican Chinese and
fondues but this year it's a bit special
because we are serving Filipino food.
I love it when they help me in the
kitchen and I'm so glad that my
sister-in-law and the whole family are
quite adventurous when it comes to
trying out Filipino food.
do you want this?
yes please
A typical Filipino birthday party is
nothing without buffet style food and it
can be a lot but for a party of ten I
think I have enough to serve
banana ketchup
seems like everybody's enjoying our
"handa" this year
And there you have it. Hope you like this
