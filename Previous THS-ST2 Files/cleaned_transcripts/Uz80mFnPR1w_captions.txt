[First shoot / Idol Truck members gathered in one place!]
[They split into the Philippines team and the Busan team!]
[An awkward first meeting / All Idol Truck members gathered!]
[Choose the K-PRODUCT!]
[Idol Truck's gold is to sell them out]
[How popular is Dara in the Philippines?]
[Ranked third in the Philippines / Duterte, Pacquiao, Sandara Park]
[Amazing class]
[The Philippines team is confident in selling them all]
[Sell out the K-PRODUCT!]
[The Philippines team STARTS choosing the products first]
[With Dara's lead, they're putting things in]
Are you counting 20?
[We have a plan]
[Good job, our team]
[Will the Philippines team sell everything?]
[Let's go, Dara!]
[Idol Truck Philippines team / Starts now!]
[Idol Truck]
[Idol Truck Philippines team members gathered! / Incheon International Airport]
[Who's the member arriving first...?]
[It's the most popular girl, Sandara Park]
The leader should always arrive first like this.
[A diligent 14-year idol / Proud to be the leader]
Someone's here!
[Hi, Jinwoo]
[Dara's close friend Jinwoo arrived second / (Runs)]
[Diligent friends]
[(Cuties)]
We, cuties, always arrive early.
[Anyway]
The other members are a bit lackadaisical.
Dindin is usually late.
[TMI about him being late revealed]
Such a rude guy.
[The third member arrived]
[Who is saying hi brightly? / (Hi)]
[Change of attitudes / The cuties welcome him politely]
Hello. (awkward)
He couldn't come to our first meeting. So it's his first day today.
[(Sorry)]
Right, I couldn't join the filming back then.
[A new face who joined the Philippines team later]
[Aaron with an attractive voice]
[(Awkward)]
Were you sick then?
I had to perform live somewhere else.
[Welcome, Aaron. Let's work hard together]
[(Just looking at the gate) / Anyway, where are the other members?]
[Youngest JONGHYEON arrived in a hurry]
[The last one / Dindin arrived last]
[(She was right) / The late one comes in relaxedly]
Am I here too early?
[(You're the last one)]
[Idol Truck Philippines team's members are here!]
[Curious]
Did the Busan team sell out their stuff?
They did on day three.
[Sold out everything on day three?]
They didn't just sell their things in one spot.
They went around and sold their things.
[The door-to-door sales queen's performance surprised the staff too]
[The door-to-door sales queen]
Honestly, I'm
[(Confidence KING)]
not worried about selling our stuff.
[Our team has the Philippines queen]
[(Laughing to agree)]
[(Am I wrong, Sandara?)]
[(Pressure)]
We need lots of people, first of all.
If it rains and there's no one, then.
Even with the rain!
It'll be a battle between the rain and Sandara Park.
Right.
[Nature vs. Dara]
[Ranked third in the Philippines / Trusting Sandara]
[Lots of pressure]
[Operation Sandara / What's the destiny of the Philippines team?]
[Idol Truck]
[The destination of this Idol Truck is?]
[The rising travel destination in the Philippines, "Clark"]
[1 a.m. Clark International Airport]
The airport has gotten really big.
[What's waiting for them other than the heat?]
[Although it's late, Sandara's fans are waiting for Sandara]
[(Looking for Sandara)]
[Ranked third in the Philippines indeed / (Operation Sandara seems to have no problem)]
[Done with the fan service / Let's keep moving]
Where's our Idol Truck car?
[(Who are you?)]
Thank you.
[The cool guy gives them a mission]
[(Curious)]
We have a mission on our first day!
[Mission / Sell more than 20 K-PRODUCTS!]
[(Already tired)]
Twenty.
[The sales place prepared in Clark!]
[And there are more than 20 K-PRODUCTS prepared!]
[A whopping 80% off sale ongoing!]
[Various kinds of K-products]
[Sell out these items within the given time!]
["Idol Truck Sales Contract" 1. Sell out the products of 20 brands. 2. Enjoy traveling outside of sales hours. 3. Accommodation that will serve as a comfortable resting place will be provided. 4. A certain amount of expenses will be provided during the sales period]
[The Philippines team going to their accomodation]
I don't think selling them will be a problem.
[(Saw how popular Sandara is)]
Honestly, I don't think selling them will be a problem.
If it was Manila,
[Friends chance]
I could ask my friends to come.
I don't know anyone in Clark.
[Clark / A city in the highlands of the Philippines with the coolest climate, renowned for its outstanding public safety, economic zone, and developed sports facilities. Along with Manila and Cebu, it is becoming a notable tourist destination in the Philippines]
[Q. How far is Manila from Clark?]
[Clark is a 2-hour drive from Manila]
- Let's call your friends on the last day.
- Should I call all of them?
[Will force them to buy it / If things are not sold, she'll use her friends]
As the last resolution!
Call all the celebrities in the Philippines!
[Must have cash / -We invite you, celebrities in the Philippines-]
Let's go to the accommodation and get some rest!
[For the sales, they need to recharge]
[Gotta rest well / (We don't know what will happen tomorrow)]
[Shock and horror / -Preview of the hardship the Philippines team will face-]
It's raining now that we're about to start the sales.
[Promoting hard / Was it from this time when things started to go wrong?]
[(The mic not working)]
[Everyone's having a mental breakdown! / (Mic not working again)]
I think the mic's broken.
[In a hurry]
This one's not it either.
[There's no change / Smoothly became a mess]
[What happened to the confident Philippines team?]
[I want to go home]
[A total mess COMING SOON!}
[A total mess COMING SOON]
[Morning of the first day at the Philippines team's accommodation]
[A swimming pool that looks refreshing just by looking at it]
[An accommodation that feels like it embraces nature with its fresh ambiance]
[Are the Idol Truck members awake?]
[The scene of building up friendship from last night]
[But]
[Who are you?]
[(Same person)]
Did you go to bed right away last night?
[(Same person) / They are...]
[Looking comfortable]
[Idol before going to work.MOV / (Yawns)]
[(Yawns)]
[Youngest JONGHYEON is up too]
You're up.
[(Bro)]
Did you sleep well?
Yes!
[Sits]
[(Stares)]
[(Made eye contact / They find themselves funny too)]
[You seem like you had a good sleep]
[(Looking outside)]
The weather is super nice!
[A sunny day welcomes the Idol Truck from the first day]
[Door lock sound]
[Sandara arrived]
Sandara is here.
[Walks]
[Surprised to see something]
[Can't help but be shocked to see this]
[Making an excuse]
- Last night.
- Just a little.
[Danger of building up friendship]
Let's plan for where to do our sales.
[(Right)]
Just lay mats on the floor.
Aren't we doing it on the street?
[(Although they're here with nothing, that's a bit...)]
With Sandara,
laying mats doesn't seem good.
[(Right, that's wrong)]
[Start from scratch / Let's start by making a plan!]
[Let's go]
[Idol Truck]
[Going to a cafe to plan for the sales]
[Heiress(?) Sandara is here]
[The heiress running elegantly]
You looked like an heiress of this place.
[(Smiles) / Feels good to hear it]
[Concerned about OOTD due to the hot weather / (Sandara's look)]
I should've revealed more skin.
[Huh?]
[An idol who debuted 19 years ago]
[If you say so, what should we do?]
Can we survive this heat?
[(Long pants)]
[(Shorts)]
[A smile of the guy who's wearing shorts]
[Just jealous]
[Start the meeting for the sales]
[Pass the resort with no people]
[Going for somewhere with many people!]
[Then a market?]
That area's price.
[To understand the area, the market is appropriate]
[Moreover, there are a lot of people gathered]
[Unanimous decision / Decided to conduct a preliminary survey at the market!]
[Preparation for business / Chapter 1. Market Research]
I didn't know when I was at the hotel. But now that I'm outside...
[The view outside the window makes it feel like we're really abroad]
How big is the Philippines' area?
It's bigger than Korea!
It consists of over 7,000 islands.
[(Amazed)}
It's consisted of islands?
So they have to move around by plane.
[She used to ride planes to go to events when she was working in the Philippines]
[(Amazed)]
What year did you debut, Sandara?
[June 2004 ABS-CBN "Star Circle Quest" celebrity audition program]
For how many years did you work in the Philippines?
[Three years!]
[Work in the Philippines]
So you nailed it for three years, right?
[(Young) / The big star in the Philippines talks about the stories from then]
It was serious back then.
K-POP became popular here after 2NE1 debuted.
[Thanks to 2NE1, K-POP has become active in the Philippines]
[Philippines K-POP representative Sandara?]
[Grateful fans who still support Sandara, who became a K-POP singer]
You were the beginning of the K-wave in the Philippines, weren't you?
I guess so.
[No need to say it / The endless talk about the old days]
It probably feels so good to know there's a country that welcomes me back no matter when I return.
[Because of the overflowing love, Sandara feels heartwarmed]
When I first left the Philippines, I felt homesick so bad.
We didn't have social media back then. We could only use emails.
[(Relates)]
[Sandara, who gave up everything she achieved at a young age]
[She takes a moment to reminisce about the past]
[(Kills the mood)]
It was sweet when you became popular in Korea, right?
[Thanks to him, the old day talk is over]
We're almost there.
[After a long drive, we arrived at Clark Pampanga's market]
[You have to visit the local market to understand the locals' preferences]
[Moreover, K-items have already made their entry]
[Understand the needs from the market where their daily lives take place!]
Then this market sells things other than food too, right?
[Namdaemun Market-styled comprehensive market]
I love the unique vibe of the market.
[What captivated the members right from the entrance?]
[Philippines' signature market beverage]
From chocolate to apple!
I want the mango!
How many mangos?
[United with the mango]
[Lots of ice]
Must be cool!
[(Jinwoo first)]
[(Sips)]
[The rich mango juice that quenches your thirst!]
[(Understood)]
It'd cost 7-8,000 won if we sold this in Korea!
[(For real)]
How much is it here?
[Is this for real? / The largest size costs 30 pesos (=about 700 won)!]
[The cost of our 5 drinks combined is 120 pesos!]
How much is 120 pesos?
[About 2,000 won!]
[Checkpoint 1 / Pricing considering the low cost of living]
[Checkpoint 1 / Pricing considering the low cost of living]
[(Is this heaven?) / Will the 80% discount be effective?]
[Checked the cost of living, now let's buy traditional clothes to appeal to familiarity]
There it is!
[Which clothing store did the members find?]
[Located in the heart of Clark Pampanga Market]
[Combining modern and traditional, situated in the center of Clark Pampanga Market]
[Philippine traditional costume specialty store!]
[(Costume) / (Waiting)]
But it's a bit.
I feel like we won't get the vibe even if we wear the traditional clothes.
Is it possible to modify the Philippine traditional costume to the members' style?
[(Careful)]
Could that be a bit rude?
[Q. Is it possible to wear a traditional top with casual bottoms?]
[Of course]
[Matching everyday clothes with the traditional Barong is a current trend in the Philippines!]
It's thicker than I thought.
[Puts it on]
[It's similar to hanbok?]
[The "Barong Tagalog" made of thin fabric like Korea's mosi and ramie]
[When matched in a modern way, it's similar to Korea's modernized hanbok]
[Teterotsalon / A contemporary reinterpretation of the traditional value of Hanbok as daily wear]
It's nice.
[Amazed]
[Perfect for hot weather due to its ventilation!]
It's not too bad!
[Looks local]
She says it's nice now with the modern style!
[Now, they have to pay]
[Given the high price of the clothing, there's a lack of funds]
It's not enough.
Can you negotiate?
I can't do that.
[Sandara, being a kind-hearted person(?), can't negotiate the price]
[Well]
[Here's the NEW Nego King]
[(7,500 pesos just for the clothes?]
[No, 1,100 for each (=5,500 pesos in total)]
[Will this]
[Work?]
Okay!
[Aaron's first negotiation is successful!]
[It's this easy?]
[They just have to pay at the discounted price!]
[Do you have a change for 500 pesos?]
[The store doesn't have change for 500 pesos]
[She doesn't have a 500-peso change!]
Let's give her 500 more pesos!
Since Aaron got the discount.
[Donating the change]
[She has the change!]
[How you can earn 500 pesos.mp4]
[How you can earn 500 pesos.mp4 / It's fine]
[Learned a great tip]
[Preview / The traditional Filipino attire is planned to be worn on the second day of sales]
[Wrapping up the market research / The Sandara fever is still burning]
Hello.
[So popular]
They know how to say hi in Korean.
[Thanks to K-POP / Korean has become a global language]
Sandara.
[Jealous]
Here, Sandara seems to mean hello.
[Totally agreed]
[Everywhere they go / People call Sandara]
When I took my Korean friends to the Philippines,
they asked, "Does Sandara mean hello?"
Hello, Sandara.
[(Blocks the way) / Asking for a selfie]
[Even the guards can't block the love for Sandara]
[It's almost impossible to film / (Belly censored) / (Thank you)]
[Might as well run for mayor?]
[Almost politician-level recognition]
[Operation Sandara's success rate is 100%]
I feel that there will be no problem with the sales!
[The failure rate will be 0%]
You should know that we came to the market
not to figure out what to sell.
[To find out how popular Sandara is(?)]
We're here to see how many days will take to sell out all of our things!
[Is it possible to sell them out earlier than expected?]
This is over!
[Will things go as expected?]
[Next time]
[Business is best after a meal! Members have come to eat lunch]
[Trusting Sandara for the lunch menu...!]
[I guess I'll have to step in]
[BUT]
[Endless dishes being served]
This is everything, right?
[Nope, there's more]
Did you buy this place, Sandara?
[Stay tuned for small eater Sandara's generous ordering in the next episode!]
