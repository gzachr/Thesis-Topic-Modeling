- Email, email, email.
It never ends.
Rolling, rolling, rolling.
Coffee beeping, time to get some coffee.
Be right back.
(soft music continues)
It's a hot day in the
Philippines here today.
Mostly I go with some hot coffee
but today it was time to get
some cold iced coffee for
a change and trying to get
my steps up with exercise
up to at least 10,000 a day.
I'm up to a, what is that?
7,902, not bad for a
2:09 in the afternoon.
So it's nice to be in
some air conditioning
with some cold coffee,
to be able to cool down a little bit.
I've been getting some questions
from you guys out there.
A lot of them having to do with
how to start a business in the Philippines
and others of you that
are in different countries
wondering how you do different
things like hire people
from the Philippines
to be able to help out
with your business.
So this week I got a question and he said,
"I'm interested in learning how one finds
VAs or virtual assistants
from the Philippines
that one can trust."
"For example, for Instagram
you have to give someone your log in info,
if they're going to post for you."
"I was concerned about that
or should I be concerned about that?"
"I've had identity fraud in the past."
"Second. Are there VAs that could hire
to be in a sales support role for me,
it seems like, you
know, a lot about this."
"Please let me know if
you're open to phone calls."
So yes, I am open to phone calls
and definitely welcome
emails about business and
hiring people in the Philippines.
So feel more than
welcome, not to just watch
but also if you ever wanna
reach out and ask questions,
I'm here to support you.
So this is a question that I
already responded to by email
and looks like we'll probably
set up a call in the future,
but I thought that this is a question that
others of you might be interested
in learning about as well.
And so that's the subject of this episode.
Okay, recording.
So this is a topic that has
interested me for a long time
and that has been a part
of my life for a long time.
Before I moved to the Philippines
I had a company Purple Cow
Agency that I started in 2008.
And my very first person
that I got to help us out
was Nguyen from Vietnam
and he worked with me as
a freelance contractor
and did a great job as a web developer.
After time, we eventually
got our own office
and started to get a
California based employees
to work from our office there.
And we've continued to
do that to this day.
At the same time, we've
always looked for contractors
to help supplement what we
would do from California.
And I worked with literally
hundreds of contractors
from India,
perhaps more than anywhere
on the technical side,
but also Russia, Vietnam, the Philippines
and a number of other places.
And so after years of doing that
and having a lot of experience
of dealing both with
local employees in the U.S
and contractors from overseas
I decided to put that experience
into starting a business
process outsource company
here in the Philippines.
And that's what a Purple Cow
in the Philippines does is
help others that are looking
for outsource employees
to be able to find reliable workers here.
So when it comes to this question of,
can you find reliable VAs
that you can trust in the Philippines?
There's really two ways to approach this.
And I think both have
some pros and some cons.
So the first one is you could
do what I had done for years
and that is go to websites like upwork.com
and you can post different jobs.
And you basically just let people know
what it is that you need done
either for a quick job
or for a long-term job.
And once you do that,
it's gonna be a number of people
that are gonna bid on that job.
And you're gonna get to see
how many stars they were
rated from past jobs,
what experience they have,
their portfolio,
feedback that they get from
reviews from other people
that have worked with them.
And this was a mixed experience for me.
So sometimes I would find
people that were phenomenal.
I would probably say about
5% of the people that I worked
with were truly wonderful.
And to this day, I still have one of those
people working with me,
Nitish and he's worked
with me for years now,
and I rely on him and trust him
and appreciate him completely.
He's just done a great job
with us over the years.
And so even though I have
an office in the Philippines
and in California now,
I still continue to be loyal to him
because of the excellent
work that he's done.
And the other hand,
I had a lot of people that
were either very low quality
or very good at what they did,
but they didn't follow through.
Honestly, it was really a mixed
kinda bag of good and bad,
but honestly, mostly average to bad.
I had to really sort through
a lot of people that weren't so good
or weren't so reliable to
find the few that were,
coffee break.
In a lot of Asian countries,
there's a lot of tea that served
and I've had some amazing tea
in places like South Korea
and other Asian countries,
certainly China.
I love red tea, which I've
only ever had in China.
It was great, but I'm really a coffee guy.
And I find that in the Philippines
and I know Vietnam is the
same coffee is huge here
and there's really some great coffee.
So it's one of those things.
I'm a long way away
from home in California,
but I'm glad that my second home
has some great coffee is here as well.
So going back to this
question from my viewer about
can you hire virtual
assistants in the Philippines?
Absolutely.
So we talked about your first choice being
going through a site like Upwork
where you're dealing one-on-one
with the virtual assistant.
The second way that you
can go about this is by
working with a business
process outsourcing company
or a BPO like Purple Cow, Philippines
that I run here in the Philippines does,
and how this works for us
is a client will come to us
and they'll let us know of
the position or positions
that they need to hire.
Either they'll have an
existing job description
or we'll help them put one
together based on the skills
and the needs that they
have for their business.
And then once that happens,
we will get to work with
our HR team posting jobs
on local job boards
here in the Philippines.
We'll search through
connections on LinkedIn
and we'll put ads on Facebook, which is
a really popular way for people
to hire in the Philippines.
And then my HR team will
do the initial interviews
where they're really
seeing if somebody has
all of the skills that our client needs
for these particular roles.
And once they make it past the HR team,
then I'm brought in for
the final interviews to
really make sure that I
also approve of the people
that they recommend
before we then pass them on to our client
to do final interviews
typically over Zoom or Facebook
chat or something like that
where through video, they're
able to see each other
and make the final decision
on who's gonna work with
their company from there
that virtual assistant
works with our clients one-on-one,
but we're also overseeing them.
So we're still taking
care of project management
and HR when it comes to things
like government benefits
which need to be paid
for employees over here,
we take care of all of that.
After they pass a probationary period,
we also take care of healthcare
for those employees as well.
And we create an environment
where employees wanna come
to work and do their best
and where each other really
encourages each other
and brings out the best each other
in a supportive work environment,
which really is very different
than just working with someone one-on-one
that's typically at home
and doesn't have those extra support
and accountability systems
to be able to lean on.
So for me,
what I think is that if you're
just looking for a short job,
something that's maybe
every once in a while,
or just a time kind of need,
something like Upwork
or one of the competitor sites to Upwork
really makes a lot of sense.
But if you're looking for someone
that's really gonna be a
part of your work family
and be there day after day
regular hours, and they're
gonna get to know who you are
who your business is, what your needs are,
and be able to grow in those skills
then makes a lot more sense
to hire a business process
outsourcing company
in the Philippines as
opposed to the Upwork,
you know, type of example.
So as always, if you have any
questions about these things,
I'm always here, let
me know how I can help.
Coffee's gone.
I guess it's time for me to go,
as always thank you for
taking the time to listen.
If you have any questions,
make sure and drop me a line.
Take care.
