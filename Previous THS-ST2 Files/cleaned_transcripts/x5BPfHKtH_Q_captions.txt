everyone what's up this is Addie here 
and welcome back to my youtube channel
so guys this challenge from philippines is 
getting really viral at the moment and i thought  
i would love to make a reaction video of this too 
and before i watch this video i would love to tell  
one thing that whenever it comes to music it comes 
to karaoke and stuff like this whenever this music  
related southeast countries are always top you 
know the whole point of me i love doing career  
case a lot because you know this is a kind of 
sense of joy because music is a kind of healing  
and that you know and you can sing throughout 
the day or night as long as you're free and  
good enough you know to sing i mean in fact even 
if you're not a good singer that doesn't really  
matter the best part about philippines is that 
you know they love music they love singing and  
i am not shocked to see that this video getting 
viral because no wonder it has to start from them  
and yes you know whether it comes to 90's the 
best part about somehow i can connect with a  
lot of people from philippines in a way that the 
kind of music they like even i have the similar  
feeling because they usually prefer alternative 
rock apart from being me being a metal hat i also  
love a lot of alternative rock and the old pop 
music of the 80s and the 90s of course i'm not  
talking about indian music i'm talking about 
there was no music maybe rock music such as  
you know bands of the 80s led zab eagles metallica 
or you talk about firehouse scorpions white lion  
mldr and the pop band such as savage garden c21 
so um so that's the best part about them like  
for some reasons like most of the people when i 
have come across from philippines have always been  
drawn to artists like the ones that have mentioned 
and for us for some reasons i love them too  
so well guys that was more of like an unwanted 
introduction that nobody want to hear maybe  
but nevertheless guys let's 
watch the video and let's see
there's this thing in philippines 
that most of the people whether you're  
whether you're a female or a male you're so good 
at singing trust me they have a very unique voice  
and that's what it's really 
good about the country you know  
wherever you go in the country you find 
people who love singing wow i love it
i
me
this is such a nice challenge i mean like i come 
across so many you know you may disagree with me  
but like ice bucket challenge or some stupid 
challenge where you just get nothing out of it  
i mean like this is such a nice way you know you 
you take up one song and you can break it into  
different you know different sections and all of 
you can sing together whoa this is how it should  
be i mean like that's so nice i wish i had you 
know people around me who would love to do that i  
am so excited i mean like if i get a chance 
to do this every day i would love to do
to all their this
each other
me
do let me know guys that if you have tried 
this challenge too i mean like this is kind  
of quite interesting whoa you can take up so 
many songs like this and all of us can sing  
normally what happens in a karaoke station 
is like you take up one song and you have to  
wait for your turn there are a lot of people 
down there and wow this is quite interesting
my
is

this is such a fun thing man i mean like you can 
you can do this for hours and hours i will never  
get bored of it i mean like oh we should i should 
definitely do this i need to find people out who  
were ready to do this of course we 
cannot do it online for sure we need  
you know to be in a group at a place where we 
can play curry okay and maybe we can do that  
wow what do i say about it 
i mean like this is so nice  
this is amazing man i mean like wow like you 
know there are a lot of things we can learn like  
i mean music is so much evolving all around the 
globe and people like us who loves music who  
loves to listen who loves to sing i never really 
maybe i wanted to be a musician when i was young  
maybe not anymore but that doesn't mean that you 
know i do not have rights or i should not sing  
or something so we love music and things like 
this will always help you make you feel better  
and always allows you to connect with people 
and as a traveler do i love traveling you know  
i've come across places where i found people 
like similar interests with terms of music and  
we had some great amazing moments so you know 
challenges like this are so nice and so good i  
don't know who came up with this one any anyone if 
you're watching my video if you know this do let  
me know in the comment section who actually found 
this challenge but whoever is this it's actually a  
nice way to socialize with people and this should 
happen on more you know public places you know on  
parks or wherever it's possible to sing you know 
it's so nice that anyone can join anyone and start  
singing together just imagine if music is there 
all around the world the world will be such a  
better place to live in right i hope you guys like
