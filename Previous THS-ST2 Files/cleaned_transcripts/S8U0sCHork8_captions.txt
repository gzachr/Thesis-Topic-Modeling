well hello YouTubers two bats and of course my 
assorted collection of crazy people why you don't  
see this every day on the old dog Channel now do 
you in fact it's such a big deal that I have a  
white woman on my channel that they blew up a 
bunch of balloons for us in the background to  
celebrate anyway this is my friend Karen 
hello and Karen is married to a Filipino  
living in the Philippines and the interesting 
thing is is just this morning I had a comment  
on one other video of mine from a woman who says 
Hey can women live and move in the Philippines and  
look what I did for you we actually set this up a 
week ago right and I met you what three months ago  
or something like that you were cordial enough to 
come up and introduce yourself to me and you are  
married to a Filipino and will you please tell 
my audience how are you and your husband met yes  
my husband and I met in 2002 on board the MV 
doulas ship we met in Port Elizabeth South Africa  
we were both missionaries at the time and my 
husband was on the ship for two and a half years  
and in 2002 I graduated from college and my friend 
invited me to go to Africa and I went to Africa on  
the ship for a month and my husband was my leader 
how old were you 23 23 yes and you went on a  
missionary trip yes to Africa that's right my kind 
of chick right here I'm telling you and so you met  
him and then what we met there we became friends 
and he was on there for two and a half years at  
the time that I met him he had only been on board 
for six months so he had to finish his commitment  
and I went back to the States and worked 
and then we kept in touch through email  
at that time there was no Facebook or social 
media back in the good old days yeah so we  
corresponded through email and then a year later 
the ship had been traveling and it went to Europe  
and it went to a little island called Malta which 
is below Italy and I I decided to go on another  
missions trip with the same organization that 
runs the ship Ministry except we were focusing  
on people in Europe different areas and my husband 
asked me to come and visit him in Malta flight  
already is yeah yeah and so I did and then at that 
point we became you know closer friends and we  
decided to start dating that's awesome and now you 
lived with your husband in America for how long
16 years yes and you've lived here in the 
Philippines for how long almost two years two  
years two years next month and this is permanent 
yes for a season this is it we will see yes this  
is it okay there's a million questions that go 
through my mind but I guess the first one is  
what is it like being a Caucasian 
Woman married to a Filipino guy  
uh you guys are in your 40s and you 
guys are running around here together  
is that complicated is it easy is it 
difficult what's it what's the vibe  
I would say um you know I've been to the 
Philippines five times and usually because our our  
home base was in the U.S we would just come here 
for a visit to see the family and everything so  
this is the longest I've been here and throughout 
the years and as we've been married and have  
gotten older I've learned to have a thicker skin 
and ignore certain certain things because being in  
a cross-cultural relationship has many challenges 
did you experience those challenges in the states  
I would say he he did go through some challenges 
there but maybe because the states is so  
Multicultural there's so many different cultures 
and you know it was important for him to also  
connect with his culture there so we would find 
local Filipino communities I think it was a little  
bit easier but for me here you know I really stand 
out yes you do and that's that can be challenging  
at times but like I said you know by God's grace I 
I am who I am I don't know how else to explain it  
that's the best way it's the only way you can 
and should be yeah um so your experience here  
is at times you said you use the word ignore 
you get funny looks do you get stairs do you  
get glares a lot different between a stair and a 
glare I mean what's the factor on the glare look
every day every day really really you see that 
kind of takes me yeah it knocks me off balance  
a little bit because it just seems so easy peasy 
and when I run around and I'm in a big age Gap you  
guys are the same age there's nothing there but um 
I don't I'm just shocked by that but we're going  
to take it as gospel because it's coming from 
her lips and so what was the state of America  
like while you were there just do you prefer it 
in the Philippines do you prefer it in the states  
um can you maybe address those issues sure sure 
um you know America has changed a lot Paul and  
um it's not the same as it 
was even five to ten years ago  
I think that the state of lawlessness is 
increasing um people don't seem to have as much  
respect for authority like they used to and we can 
see that ever since you know covid happened right  
everything changed right yes it did and now we 
have shootings almost every week I I mean I keep  
up with the news in the U.S almost daily and there 
was just another shooting yesterday in fact and so  
um I miss it there of course my family's there 
my good friends are there I miss certain things  
about it but right now living here it's it's very 
different it's very peaceful living on the island  
uh-huh I don't feel like fear of shootings every 
day or shootings in my kids school at this moment  
whereas in the U.S I was always scared to see oh 
is today going to be a day where their school is  
well I never thought about that because it's been 
so long since since I was taking kids to school  
it's been 30 years but I never had that fear 
but that's something that's amped up so when  
you took your kids to school in America did you 
drop them off and like say a prayer there wasn't  
going to be a mass shooting today or well they 
went to public school for a short time and then  
um we put them in a Christian School a small 
Christian School and we know the people there  
we know the principal we know the teachers and we 
had a peace of mind not that it couldn't happen  
there right correct but crazy it's crazy but yeah 
wow yeah so in the two years that you've been here  
have you found that you've what is what is the 
most that you feel that you've gained or lost  
I mean do you have like more of an inner peace 
here would you recommend the Philippines for other  
females to come and maybe possibly if they're my 
age for example they're they're on their social  
security check like me would you recommend it for 
a female to come over here do you think that they  
would feel safe and comfortable and fit in or 
would it be too challenging or I think it depends  
on the person you know if you're adventurous 
and for me I'm adventurous I like I'm a tropical  
person I like warm weather the Filipino people 
are some of the most friendliest people I think  
I've ever met right and very hospitable right and 
welcoming right they make you feel very welcome so  
I think you can easily come here and feel that 
love and care and there's ways to meet people  
you know communities there's different expat 
groups that you can connect with so I think it's  
it would be a good thing what about the state of 
women in general in America I hear that there are  
a lot of women that have kind of done with their 
fathers suggested they do which is become strong  
independent go to college get a degree and on 
the surface there's nothing wrong with that  
but it seems like women in America have sort of 
Fallen away from the more traditional roles is  
that a lot of hype or is that the norm or do you 
not have an opinion on that I think it's mixed
Mexican and I have a traditional view okay 
my husband and I both always work but I think  
feminism is very strong in America now women's 
rights so I think it depends on the group and  
the community that you're involved in do you 
think the part of the country matters you think  
the part of the country matters like if you're 
in the South I think so I think a lot of it's  
territorial depending on which state you're in 
the midwest I think is much more traditional I  
would think than say New York or California or 
San Francisco or the hotbed seems to be Portland  
Oregon now and all that and people can steal 
up to nine hundred dollars with a stuff without  
getting stopped and I'm hearing all these loopy 
things that I actually I can't even process it  
that you can just walk into 7-Eleven or Sears and 
Roebuck if those still exist I don't know and just  
walk out with a bunch of stuff is that a fact 
that is a fact my friend actually told me that  
she has to allow people to do that where she works 
they can just shoplift and leave the store with  
800 worth of items and there's nothing they can 
do do they call the police they don't there's no  
point because the police won't come I don't know 
it's it's crazy I don't know how anybody's gonna  
stay in business I know I mean if even a big store 
I mean if it becomes and if it becomes a trend and  
a cycle where everybody just starts to catch on 
and say well I can go get those pants and that  
sweater and that TV set and walk out with it no 
one's going to stop it it just to me I'm having  
a hard time fathoming that well maybe you're 
aware they're trying to defend the police in  
certain cities and states uh-huh so that's another 
issue as well now you were talking and I really  
want to dig into this because I don't do it often 
enough but we were talking about your Christian  
walk yeah and how you feel that this is the end 
of times yes and that you're seeing the signs  
of it could you get into that with my audience 
a little bit sure I'd love to talk about that  
um we are living in the end times you know Jesus 
gave us signs in the word of God he told us what  
it would be like in the end Wars rumors of wars 
earthquakes and not just little earthquakes huge  
earthquakes and if you're really watching 
some of those things they're increasing it's  
not just like 2.3 it's 6 7 8 in some places 
like the one in turkey that we had recently  
um also at the End of the Age there's a rise in 
lawlessness a lack of respect lack of love for  
people in second Timothy it talks a lot about 
the signs of the last days in the New Testament  
I can't just point to one because they're all 
converging right now It also says that no man  
will know the day yeah that's right we don't know 
the day or the hour of when Jesus will come but  
we know the signs in this season we can know the 
signs and the season of that time and what stood  
out to me is when covet happened and the lockdowns 
and taking away people's rights and freedom and  
it's happening not just in one country it's 
Global yes and um during the the last part of the  
of time which we know in the word of God 
is the seven year tribulation there's gonna  
be a one world leader a global leader that 
will have control he will be given control  
so right now when you look at the news and you 
see the news and you connect the dots with the  
word of God because I base it on not me but 
what does the word of God say and you can put  
the pieces together and you know I've had this 
conversation with a number of my good friends  
that are also Believers yeah and I've told them I 
think this is a good thing yeah yeah because it's  
prophesized yes and it's been spoken of and it's 
supposed to happen that's right and so this is  
actually the bad news is good news that's right 
that's the way I see it yes and I said to myself  
a long time ago when the internet first came on 
this is not good this is too unfiltered this is  
too open this is you know the prince of the air 
now has full range anybody and everybody can do  
anything yeah there's all this AI stuff that's 
going on I just recently heard about this week  
that you can get it you can get a program to tell 
you to write you a term paper on Thomas Edison or  
whatever or a breakup letter with your girlfriend 
it'll do it so no longer do we have to think it's  
it's it's dumbing down the internet is supposed 
to be there I thought originally as a resource  
a place where you could go like we used to have 
encyclopedias in my house and we used to have to  
pull the encyclopedia down and we would we were 
talking about I was talking about this with a  
couple of my friends the other day we were just 
plagiarize the encyclopedia when the the teacher  
said okay I want you to write about Abraham 
Lincoln so we would just copy word for word out  
of the encyclopedia about Abraham Lincoln however 
because we read it and because we wrote it down  
through osmosis we learned you know where now 
that's taken away and it's just okay give me this  
and it's immediate gratification immediate reward 
and no effort is put forth in order to get it and  
that's just the beginning yeah and so I can see 
I don't mean this to be a depressing video but I  
could just see it spiraling down um I don't know 
what are your thoughts on that well it's true and  
um we have to have a different perspective 
as as a Believer it's exciting because  
prophecy is being fulfilled God's word is always 
true he remains faithful to his promises and so  
when you see these things Jesus said when you see 
these things begin to take place look up lift up  
your heads because your Redemption draws near and 
you know the world is in chaos yeah but it has to  
go into this season because it leads into the end 
times it actually does have to it's supposed to  
happen it's supposed to happen so this is unsure 
a lot different than what you thought you were  
going to get today you didn't know we were going 
to church but we did and I'm so grateful for it  
and we've got people moving furniture behind us so 
and we have these lovely balloons but we got the  
balloons so let's make it up for the noise in your 
husband he works online yeah he's also a pastor  
um he's not really a pastor right now he's a Bible 
teacher he teaches at a local Bible College here  
yes and you work online I work online I 
serve with the Billy Graham Evangelistic  
Association in the U.S it's based out of North 
Carolina and when covid started they began a  
prayer line 24 7 prayer line where people can 
call in at any time of the day and receive  
someone on the other end that's there to 
encourage them pray for them and sometimes  
we counsel people there's a lot of hurting people 
yeah and that's that's when I'm busy doing these  
days good for you yeah I need more of you uh 
an encouraging word is sometimes all people  
need yeah you know and it comes so rarely 
and it's like I was thinking the other day  
how how eloquently and how how beautifully we 
speak it's of someone at their funeral and I  
think maybe you should have said that while they 
were alive yeah you know to their face pull them  
aside and said you know what I think you're 
valuable I think you're worthy I think you're  
good I think you're capable I think you're able 
but we we don't do that enough so I'd like to  
just say that to you right now that's exactly how 
I feel thank you I really appreciate that um what  
else are they going to ask you coven you touched 
on covet that was interesting because it gave  
everybody out there a taste for what it's going 
to be like when things are digitalized and we are  
controlled more and more by the powers that be you 
spoke at one you know world leader and supposedly  
will come out of someplace very benign and not 
someplace like a superpower I remember that some  
people say Europe yeah some Bible prophecy experts 
say Europe yeah but it was interesting because we  
were discussing how we got a little taste of that 
with our vaccination cards or our injections yeah  
or our face masks now I was not allowed to walk 
into Lee Plaza or I was not allowed to walk into a  
department store or a hospital that didn't place a 
face mask on I was not able to get on an airplane  
or a boat or even into a taxi for that matter I 
didn't have a vaccinated Nation so that's sort of  
a prelim I think to what's going to be happening 
and I don't know how you guys felt about it but  
I really resented it I especially when they began 
to mandate it and say that you have to do it yep  
um I think that if someone wanted to get 
vaccinated rock on get vaccinated if that makes  
you feel good cool do it you know maybe it works 
maybe it doesn't but it's your choice and once  
our freedoms are taken away from us I think we're 
really in trouble and again but we have to spend  
that to your belief system and my belief system is 
that that trouble is actually the foreshadowing of  
good news yes yeah something good that's going to 
happen so what would you share with the ladies out  
there let's lighten it up a little bit um that are 
maybe thinking about coming out to the Philippines  
any advice um I think you should say I want to 
just come on a vacation and hang out for a while  
come enjoy this beautiful country the people here 
are so loving and so welcoming they smile all the  
time and I just love that and they're very eager 
to help right like when you're at the store or  
wherever you are because I fell down and dropped 
my groceries I know they would be right there to  
help me versus in the states that happened to me 
I had three bags they fell all over the street  
and people walk by yeah and I'm not trying to be 
negative but I I was left to myself and it's just  
different it's different so I would say come 
visit the Philippines if you're considering  
moving here I would say come first and visit and 
check it out for a few months at least six months  
oh absolutely I always say if you can make a Recon 
run make it make sure you like the temperature of  
the people the attitude the living conditions 
it's not Paradise it's not perfect there's a  
lot of flaws with the Philippines if there was a 
perfect place on Earth we'd all be living there  
and so that's why we're all still spread out a 
lot of us are still on that search um however
a woman that say is my age and is 
receiving her pension uh would you  
find that it would be economically more 
viable for her here if she didn't have  
the opportunity to say have a second job 
or a second career she's a widower widow  
um would you agree with that I would I would and 
would she feel safe here yes I I have a friend  
here I won't go into a lot of details but she 
is in that age bracket same situation and she  
loves it here she's been here many many years 
she feels safe she's happy to be here her her  
social security is enough to cover all of her 
expenses and she wants to stay and so other  
females that that are maybe in their 30s or 40s 
or 50s whatever they're not going to receive a uh  
money on an income stream but there is the ability 
to work online now so if they have a job at Google  
they have a job at you know Barnes and Noble 
whatever and they're working online as an  
accountant or whatever it's just a matter of 
adjusting to the time isn't it yes because  
you have to be up at midnight or something to work 
yes yeah yeah like maybe you're going to work from  
9 p.m here to 5 a.m because it's daytime in the 
states or whatever whichever country they're from  
right right you have to make uh sacrifices 
but you know well I know I gotta I gotta  
say we'll wrap it up and her name is Karen if I 
didn't tell you and she's anything but a Karen
I first mentioned that when I first met her school 
I'm so sick of hearing that because of the Karen  
analogy but I do have to ask you are women in 
America as angry as as they're portrayed or is  
that being blown out of proportion well I haven't 
been home for two years so you know I don't really  
know right now but I think a lot of what we 
see is blown out of proportion I do too and  
um for me I just take it with a grain of salt I 
don't spend too much time focusing on it there's  
always people that want to be negative and 
critical and putting others down right and  
that's not what life is about and I'd rather 
spend my time on other things you know it's  
important to build people up encourage them Speak 
life right be positive yes and spend your time  
bettering the community well I don't know how 
else to end it other than that be positive have  
a better attitude help others and encourage 
people Karen thank you so much thank you  
Paul thanks for having me all right I will 
see you crazy people in the next video bye
