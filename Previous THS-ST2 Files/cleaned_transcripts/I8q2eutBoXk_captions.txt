She came off the farm
E, she's trying too hard
D, she's on Tinder
C, she's a movie star, alright?
But B? She looks like iCarly
And A, that's my girl
I'm done!
Hey!
Hey guys!
What's going on guys?
I'm Xiaoma (@xiaomanyc), and today...
Sorry, I was just taking a little bit of a nap
Got a really fun video for you guys today
Because you guys asked
And you said...
Xiaoma, we want another Filipino video!
And yes, today...
We're bringing back a Filipino video, okay!
I've done this type of video before
Where I let people in New York City...
See what celebrities in another part of the world look like
See what kind of like, Americans...
Who Americans think is the most beautiful, the most handsome
And I think it's a really interesting type of video
Because that I think a lot of times what Americans...
...might think about how somebody looks
Is not necessarily the way that somebody...
...from another culture might think about how their own celebrities look
I asked you guys on YouTube...
...what celebrities from the Philippines you wanted me to feature on today's video
And so!
And so! Today, I am pleased to announce...
We have...
These...six famous Filipino celebrities
We got Nadine Lustre!
We got Maine Mendoza!
We got Liza Soberano!
We got Kathryn Bernardo!
We got Maymay Entrata
And we got Anne Curtis today
It'll just be interesting to see who in Americans' eyes
And people from all around the world here in New York City...
According to their own beauty standards
Who they think would be the most attractive and why
Yeah guys!
And, if you like this video...
Please subscribe
And let me know what other types of videos like this you guys would want to see
So
Yeah!
Come on, let's go guys!
Basically what we're doing today
Is we are asking people to...
Judge the appearance of these...
Six celebrities...
That's kind of superficial, isn't it?
A little bit, yes it is
But the idea behind it is that
A lot of people in the Philippines would have their own perceptions of what these celebrities look like
So the idea here is to sort of see like...
What people's beauty standards here are like
This is totally superficial
But knowing nothing else about these celebrities...
Who would you think personally is the most attractive to you and why?
Most attractive to me and why?
Yeah
Oh my
They're all attractive, but for me, probably D (Kathryn Bernardo)
D, why D?
Oh jeez
I don't know, I like...her hair
And...her cheekbones
Her cheekbones look really nice
Cool!
And her lips are nice too, so...
Lips, right
[Xiaoma:] Awesome, thank you so much man, really appreciate it!
[Man:] Of course man, yeah!
Thank you!
So we have six celebrities here
Who are all really popular in the Philippines
And we want to know according to people's own beauty standards here
Who they think is the most beautiful and why
Okay, well...
I wouldn't compare them all, because they have like...
[Right:] All different types of individual beauty
[Left:] They're all so pretty!
I can't pick a certain one because they're all gorgeous, right?
And they probably have their own personalities and stuff like that, so...
C? (Liza Soberano)
I think C too, yeah
Oh, you too?
Yeah
Why?
Not too much makeup
Okay
And I feel like her face is very symmetrical
And we want to see what people here
According to their own beauty standards
Would think is the most beautiful
Okay
Or attractive
So...
So who would you think?
[Spanish] Who's
[Spanish] Out of all of them?
B? (Maine Mendoza)
You think B?
Yeah
Why?
Her eyes
[Woman:] Obviously her eyes
[Guy:] Her hair!
Her smile!
Smile, yeah
So beautiful!
You think B too?
Yeah
Okay
[Speaking Spanish] Who's the most beautiful?
Same!
B also?
Why?
She's cute!
Yeah, yeah, yeah!
I think in regards for Americans...
Probably C... (Liza Soberano)
Or maybe A... (Nadine Lustre)
C or A?
Would like stick out the most
Yeah? Why?
I'm getting heavy Angelina Jolie vibes from C
Heavy!
Yeah, a little bit!
A (Nadine Lustre), I just like the makeup on her
Like the makeup, yeah
And what would you think?
I would think...either C or D, too (Liza Soberano and Kathryn Bernardo)
C or D?
Yeah
Why?
She [Kathryn Bernardo] kinda reminds me of Anne Hathaway a little bit
Oh my god, yeah, a little bit!
[Xiaoma:] Totally!
[Girl:] Like a tinge...
Like Anne Hathaway with bangs, though
Oh my god, yeah!
And then D?
Honestly it kinda gives me Instagram vibes
Instagram, yeah yeah, a little bit!
Very Instagrammy
They...are all quite beautiful
I don't know
B, C?
B and C?
Yeah
Why?
I don't know, I think their eyes smile
Yeah
[Liza Soberano] has a bit more sexy look
Right
Maine Mendoza is getting a lot attention today
Alright, let's keep going
Which one you most like?
Me?
Yeah
For me...
There's no question, for me it's E
Maymay Entrata here
Okay
I just think she...
There's just some kinda look about her...
John, what do you think?
I like D! [Kathryn Bernardo]
You like D?
Yeah
Why?
Because...
Lovely...eyes
Yeah, she does have pretty eyes
Hair
Yeah
And umm...
The baby face
Baby face, yeah
So we basically have a list of six famous celebrities...
I don't know these people!
[Xiaoma:] No no, it's okay, you don't have to know them
[Man:] Are we on camera right now?
We're just kinda looking to see like...
Basically how people's beauty standards differ here and in the Philippines
Oh, that's interesting
Yeah, and so [we want to know] how people here...
...would perceive these celebrities
And if there's one in particular that's particularly beautiful or attractive
I would say A is beautiful [Nadine Lustre]
Yeah
Why?
I'd just say her eyebrows look nice
She has full lips
She has good cheekbones
And her hair with the part...
She just looks Filipino
Interesting
You've got such great analysis!
What would you say?
I think they all look pretty!
Yeah
Any of them could walk down the street and I'd be like, wow they're pretty!
I just feel like [Nadine Lustre] looks Filipino
I wouldn't be able to tell what B and C...
[Woman:] I couldn't tell...
[Man:] Yeah, they look all American
No...
These two look Hispanic
What, B and...?
B and C [Maine Mendoza and Liza Soberano]
Even...white, half white or half hispanic
So you like that Filipino look?
Yeah
I mean they're all pretty
Probably D or A [Kathryn Bernardo or Nadine Lustre]
D or A?
I'd say...
B or D [Maine Mendoza or Kathryn Bernardo]
Okay
C's cute too [Liza Soberano]
I think A [Nadine Lustre]
A? Why?
Because [of] her eyebrows
Eyebrows!
Probably her lashes make her pop out more
Yeah?
Yeah
I'd do B and D
And why do you think that?
B because her smile's pretty
And D, I like her brows!
D, her eyes are cute
Yeah
[Xiaoma:] Cool, thank you guys so much!
[Girls:] You're welcome!
This is actually a video about celebrities
Celebrities?
So I have a lot of fans from the Philippines...
But I'm not on there!
Next time!
Okay, okay
So these are all very famous celebrities in the Phillipines
And we're looking to see what people here according to their own beauty standards...
Would think is the most beautiful or attractive
A! [Nadine Lustre]
A, why?
She...
She has a full face of makeup?!
[Guy:] No!!!
[Girl:] Let him talk!
Let him talk!
A, because you know...
Back in my city, I'm from Toronto, right?
Who is the most beautiful?
Toronto, six side! [Six is a nickname for Toronto]
Back in my city, umm...
I don't see girls like that, you know what I mean?
I'd say C, to be honest [Liza Soberano]
[Girl:] C and B! [Liza Soberano and Maine Mendoza]
[Girl:] I say F! [Anne Curtis]
B [Maine Mendoza] is naturally beautiful!
She's someone who I would...
[Girl:] Her smile too!
[Girl:] B is naturally beautiful!
And her smile!
But C [Liza Soberano]...is like a sexy type of woman!
[Guy:] A [Nadine Lustre] looks like she's thicc though! [slang for curvy]
[Girl:] I would say B [Maine Mendoza] more because of her smile
[Guy:] She's thicc though!
[Girl:] F [Anne Curtis] is naturally pretty
I think it's because she has big eyes...
I like A [Nadine Lustre] because she has big eyes
And her lips are full, that's my type of beauty!
B or C [Maine Mendoza or Liza Soberano], like what you said
[Girl:] The smile...
[Guy:] F [Anne Curtis] just came off the farm though!
[Girl:] This smile [Maine Mendoza] is natural, but this [Liza Soberano] is sexy...
[Girl:] She is sexy...
I like G too, you know?
Oh, G is you, right?
Yeah yeah yeah...
Nah, but F...
She came off the farm
E, she's trying too hard
D, she's on Tinder
C, she's a movie star, alright?
But B? She looks like iCarly
And A, that's my girl
I'm done!
Thank you guys so much, really appreciate it!
No problem!
I would say...
C... [Liza Soberano]
B and D [Maine Mendoza and Kathryn Bernardo]
C B and D?
Yeah
Why?
I have no idea, I just think that they have pretty eyes, and...
I don't know, I don't know
So if you had to pick one?
Out of them? What would you...
D [Kathryn Bernardo]
D, okay
[Xiaoma:] Is there one that stands out to you as particularly beautiful?
[Woman:] I don't even know them
Who they are
I think she is
C? [Liza Soberano]
Yeah
Why?
I don't know, just...she looks edgy!
Edgy
Yeah
Interesting
Little bit more edgy
Little edgy, yeah?
I like the edgier [ones] more!
I like it, cool!
Thank you so much, appreciate it, thank you!
Number D [Kathryn Bernardo] stands out
D?
Yeah
Why?
Umm...she has more of a natural type look
But also looks really feminine...I don't know, I like it
[Xiaoma:] Interesting
[Girl:] It's a natural look to her
Cool
I have to go with D too
D? Yeah
Why?
Same thing, like natural
Just natural, yeah
I mean, the one that I would say is particularly attractive to me is D
Why
Mostly because I like her smile and she has really nice dimples
Cool
I think D too, because...
She has more...clearer skin
Yeah
And the hair
Right
Yeah, that's it!
Cool!
Sweet, thank you guys so much, really appreciate it!
Thank you guys!
I thought that was really interesting
It was actually, you know what?
To my mind, that seemed like a very close race
I really think that...
People had a hard time choosing
And it wasn't really surprising, they all are obviously very beautiful
Personally I think some interesting things that stood out for me...
Were that people really kind of appreciated like...
A natural look, sort of?
They didn't necessarily appreciate so much makeup
But a lot of people did also like that sexy look
Anyway guys, thanks so much for watching!
And...we'll see you all next time!
Bye bye!
