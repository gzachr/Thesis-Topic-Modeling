Filipinos are so nice yeah I 
know I'm not a Filipina Espanol
okay Puerto Rico
everybody says lechon is famous from Cebu Ys
in the morning are you guys making tick 
tocks yeah can I make one with you yeah
foreign
what's up guys welcome back to a brand new video 
in a beautiful country that I have been dying to  
visit for so many years I'm in the Philippines I 
actually got here last night I'm in Cebu City and  
right now I'm about to explore this area for my 
very first time now I'm actually heading over to  
Fort San Pedro I've heard many great things about 
that area the fort itself is a very historical  
site here in the city so I decided why not tune 
on in and share with you guys my first few hours  
of exploring Cebu City now right now I'm actually 
walking out of a huge shopping mall this is the  
Robinsons Galleria I'm actually staying at a hotel 
called The Summit Galleria very beautiful place  
I actually showed up there on accident yesterday 
because of a Airbnb nightmare I promise you guys  
I'm done using Airbnb Airbnb is literally the 
worst and nothing but problems but I'll explain  
a little bit more about that later on today now 
the weather out here in Cebu is actually quite hot  
and last night it was actually a 
little bit cold so it's very confusing  
compared to the climate that we just experienced 
in Thailand the last few weeks where it was just  
extremely hot and humid last night it was actually 
very fresh but right now it is warm but it's nice  
I like it it's actually not too humid I've 
been told that it's rainy season right now  
I'm not sure if that is true or not but that 
is what uh the taxi driver told me yesterday  
leaving from the airport over to the area that 
I'm in right now which I actually have no idea  
what the name of this area is but yeah this 
here is Cebu City looks a little Moody looks  
like there might be some rain on the way you 
got a grab driver all kinds of taxis local  
buses right here but you know what I think we're 
actually gonna walk I think we're gonna walk in  
and see what this city has to offer on foot well 
at least attempt it it does say that we are 25  
minute walking from Fort San Pedro so let's see 
let's see if there's enough to keep us entertained  
throughout our walk here now I do want to point 
something out or tell you guys about something and  
that is the people the Filipino people have been 
so incredibly friendly since the moment we arrived  
I've been told that the Philippines is the land 
of some of the most precious people on this planet  
and I actually worked with a lot of Filipinos 
back in the U.S when um when I was working my  
normal job I worked with a lot of Filipinos and 
they were all lovely people they loved to eat love  
to have a good time and I remember around the 
holiday times that all the Filipinos at my job  
would gather around and celebrate together 
and always invite uh myself and other people  
uh that worked in the same spots to their homes 
for Christmas and New Year's because they always  
threw some huge parties so yeah Filipinos amazing 
so far I can't wait to start interacting with  
a lot of locals wow those buses look cool I 
wouldn't mind jumping on one of those today  
so yeah we're gonna be interacting 
hopefully with a lot of Filipinos  
um in this video and of course over the course of 
the next three weeks that I'm in the Philippines  
I'm gonna be making sure that I show you 
guys the most important part of the country  
is the people so join me as 
we explore Cebu City all right  
it's only been a few minutes but right 
off the bat I'm filming very warm already
but yeah this area that I'm in right now actually 
looks like it might be a nice combination of like  
Industrial and well of course like a shopping 
district because we just made it out of a huge  
Mall oh there's one of those Jeeps right now 
I think those are what they call a jeepney  
I'm not too sure but I've watched a few quite 
a bit of Vlogs here in the Philippines and I'm  
pretty sure that those are the Jeep knees if 
I remember clearly we'll have to ask somebody  
about that a little later on right now oh wow 
he was on a dirt bike we got some scooter action  
a lot of energy on the streets no 
obviously we're not in a big city  
um the capital of Manila we'll be there in about a 
week and a half time but I still have been told by  
many people that Cebu City is one of the larger 
cities in the entire country of the Philippines  
Shell gas station I wonder what petrol prices are 
like out here oh and actually I can read it from  
here it says 558 pesos 628 pesos and 646 pesos I'm 
not sure if that's for a liter or for the gallon  
we'll have to find that out later on today oh 
man it's getting incredibly warm out right now
incredibly warm hello
I believe um I was asking the 
driver yesterday for a couple  
advice on words that I should know and the 
most important one that he told me hello  
I'm telling you the Filipinos they love 
me the most important one that he taught  
me was salamat which means thank you okay yeah 
this definitely looks like an industrial area  
probably shouldn't walked that way you know what 
let's continue on this way and who knows maybe  
we'll just hop into a a taxi and make our way 
over to the Fort because it is extremely warm  
out today have a nice day how can I get to 
San uh Fort San Pedro Port San Pedro that way
that way thank you all right  
you too take care lovely people all right so Fort 
San Pedro's this way it was on the street that  
I was walking down I looked on Google Maps but 
it's kind of confusing to be honest with you guys  
according to the map of Cebu City there's all 
kinds of roundabouts and one-way streets and  
um there was actually a bunch of roads 
that were closed down due to construction  
yesterday where we were driving around 
in the taxi so we had to like Veer off  
into different directions in order to 
make it to our hotel which was actually  
only a straight shot from The Nightmare 
of an Airbnb that we we're staying in or  
checking into you know what let's actually see 
if we can wave down a taxi no that one's full
I wonder if they have Moto 
taxis here in the Philippines  
I actually see a lot of police 
officers over in this direction
but man traffic time now right now it's 
actually um right now it's actually
one in the afternoon so it's extremely 
busy out on the streets today but I  
have a feeling that it's only going to 
continue to get worse as the day goes on
most places in the world the traffic jam  
always starts between like 4 30 to like six when 
everybody starts getting off of work all right
yeah I'm starting to sweat now you know what 
we're gonna hide underneath this tree and I  
think that's exactly what I'm gonna do I'm 
gonna wave down a taxi and we're gonna just  
hop into a taxi and make our way over to the fort 
because this is brutal but let me actually show  
you guys a little bit of these Filipino pesos 
while we're here so this here is a 500 bill  
and it says Puerto Princesa and it has a parrot on 
it limandang piso so these are the Filipino pisos  
and who's on the back benjino Aquino Jr pangulo 
NG Philippines so this is 500 around 10 US dollars  
and in here we have a hundred peso notes which has 
the my own volcano in the back and the whale shark
very beautiful money
you always can tell that you're in a great country 
when the money looks beautiful all right you know  
what wow there's people hanging off the back of 
that truck the jeepney I'm just gonna keep calling  
it a jeepney if it's a jeepney you let me know 
down in the comment section and I have a feeling  
that that's the iconic jeepney now I could take a 
grab grabs are actually quite affordable as well
but um they do take a while to come and I really 
don't want to kill like a whole 10 minutes  
oh there's a taxi right there sexy nope that 
one's busy Taxi that one's busy too policeman Taxi
hello can you take me to Fort San Pedro 
thank you oh man it's very hot today  
is the Philippines always hot no uh

[Music] salamat oh man
Tagalog no no not not Tagalog no I 
don't I I only speak English in Spanish  
you speak Spanish espanol no a lot of people 
in Cebu speak English though and very well  
I wonder if that's the same in all 
of the Philippines I know here in  
the city though everybody we've talked 
to has spoke incredibly good English
is this the port City

the ports huh come on Chris you should know  
better than this Oh look The Coconut

yeah like there's all kinds of stores little 
shops along the sides of the roads man we  
actually should have continued walking it looks 
very interesting around here a Marlboro store
this looks like a very local neighborhood 
I should have came walking man but  
I'm frying and I have a feeling that right 
now we're gonna make it to the Fort a lot  
faster than if I would have been walking the 
entire way and I made a new friend [Music]

Plaza looks super beautiful guys so yeah

Impressions on how beautiful  
this area is how beautiful the Philippines

statue up there we'll go check that out as well
they must be training for uh 
Dancing with the Stars or something
interesting all right well let's come check out 
the statue and then we'll jump on into the fort  
let me know what are your guys's favorite 
places in the Philippines what are some  
places that I should not miss when I'm here in 
this beautiful country now one thing that I've  
um always loved so much about the Philippines is 
the flag I see it absolutely everywhere especially  
in the U.S at all the Filipino restaurants 
and the flag is always incredibly beautiful  
I mean always it is incredibly beautiful it's blue 
red has like a a sun in the middle and some Stars
it grabs all the attention though 
oh man this is where people come  
to dance look you got some other 
kids over in this area dancing
and this here is the statue what is the Statue 
of I wonder oh man I should have definitely put  
on some sunscreen this morning it is hot it's 
cooking out here today beautiful Filipino flag
all right so it says that this here is
oh man this is like in Spanish look 
obviously because well the Philippines  
was founded by the Spanish so you find a 
lot of Spanish everywhere this one here says
oh wow so this is the first governor of 
the island and the founder of this city  
but who is it oh it says a name of there I 
can't read that I can't read the Top Line
but it doesn't look like there's 
actually anybody on the statue
reynando Isabel Segundo LA Pro yeah Mandan um 
it says that this is from the year 1855 Queen  
Isabel Queen Isabel the second in mandando LA Pro 
interesting I mean it's a very beautiful statue  
but there's nothing on top of it all right you 
know what um we could walk around this park a  
lot longer but then we're never gonna make 
it into the fort let's go inside and let's  
go explore Fort San Pedro oh you know I did 
say that the walk looked pretty interesting  
um on the way here but it is also incredibly 
hot so I'm kind of glad that I didn't do that  
the taxi driver saved our saved our butts and 
he was also a very kind guy so it was nice to  
be able to jump into his taxi and chop it up for 
a little bit why not always makes for a great time  
now I'm actually gonna look up some information 
about this Fords because I didn't do any proper  
research before coming here I just kind of showed 
up and was like you know what I'm gonna wing it  
I'm gonna take people's recommendations and then 
go see what they want uh what they recommend that  
I see and everybody told me to come to this Forks 
so let's see what the fort San Pedro is all about  
and of course I'm gonna use the handy 
dandy Google to help me out here  
all right so this here is the Fort San Pedro and 
it says that the four percent Pedro is a military  
defense structure in Cebu Philippines and it was 
built by the Spanish under the command of Miguel  
Lopez de legaspi the first governor of the uh 
general of the Philippines it is located in the  
area now called Plaza independencia oh so this 
must be Plaza independencia Independent Square
and it is in the heart of the pier area of the 
city the original Fort was made of wood and built  
after the arrival of legaspi and his expedition 
in the early 17th century a stone Fort was built  
to repel Muslim Raiders today the structure dates 
from 1738 and it is the oldest triangular Bastion  
fort in the country seems like we came to a great 
place to kick off our first impressions video here  
in the Philippines wow this is beautiful
here we go fort San Pedro all right 
well you know what hello let's enter
a lot of tourists too huh everybody I've 
ever met that has been to the Philippines  
absolutely loves this place all right here 
there's actually a little plaque that says  
forts of San Pedro the fourth of San Pedro 
described in an official report of 1739 is  
a triangular in shape is triangular in shape and 
made of stone in Mortar the three bastions are La  
Concepcion San Ignacio de Loyola in San Miguel 
Powder Magazine cool all right let's go inside
oh
man look this is what the original Fort 
looked like the original structure of the  
fort as I just read was made out of wood 
well on the construction started in 1565.
this is another picture of the fort from 1920
wow very historical place
hello good night um paper entrance Rhino 
30 pesos United States thank you so much
yes just by myself
thank you so much
thank you
very nice okay so we're inside of the fort 
now 30 pesos I'm not sure exactly what that  
is I think it's less than a dollar to be fair 
all right wow this place looks super beautiful  
and there's this tent that I'm standing under 
now that makes it incredibly fresh here as well  
for San Pedro all right let's walk around 
and explore the fort a little bit why not
I can hear there's some people playing 
some music maybe we'll hit that down on  
the way on the way back down but I want to 
go up there and kind of like go stand where  
we just saw those girls looking down from  
that said hi to me comfort room oh this is 
like the bathroom nice little place to cool off
I love visiting historical sites like 
this especially sites that are of great  
significance to every country wow this is 
awesome and so peaceful too so relaxing
oh those are ducks how do you say 
ducks in Tagalog oh like in Spanish
that's awesome it's the same word in Spanish 
yeah I think I think a lot of the words in  
Tagalog are probably going to be um very 
similar if not exactly the same to Spanish  
man I'm gonna have a great time here in the 
Philippines everybody speaks well a lot of people  
have a pretty good understanding of Spanish 
but then also a lot of people speak very well  
English as well so the videos should be 
pretty entertaining and very informative
oh man this is cool you know what this 
reminds me of this reminds me of the fort  
and Cartagena Colombia in 
Cartagena Colombia there's a fort  
kind of similar to this a lot larger in size 
but um same similar structure as far as like  
these little um look out post Lookout 
towers and the cannons and this is cool
wow the city of Cebu I'm 
impressed you're beautiful  
palm trees I wonder if those palm trees up 
here when they constructed the fort or do  
you think this is something that they put here 
too you know add the tropical Vibes to the fort
man this is impressive let me know what you guys 
think of this fort down in the comments section  
you know what let's try and see when this fort 
was abandoned by the Spanish online because  
I know you guys are probably just 
as interested in that as I am  
it's okay so it says here that the fort served as 
the nucleus of the first Spanish settlement in the  
Philippines during the Philippine Revolution at 
the end of the 19th century it was attacked and  
taken by Filipino revolutionaries and it was used 
as a stronghold for the Filipino revolutionaries  
as I mentioned below downstairs construction 
started here in 1565 1565. that means that  
this fort had been around for almost 200 years 
before the United States was ever even a country  
very impressive now the date of construction 
of the Stone Fort is uncertain although there  
are claims that a Jesuits Antonio campioni built a 
stone forts in 1630 at the gates of the fort bears
that date 17 that date 1738 together 
with the arms of Castile and Leon  
I'm very confused right now maybe I shouldn't 
be reading this off of Google all right now it  
also says that Fort San Pedro became a part 
of the American Warwick Barracks during the  
American regime from 1937 to 1941 the barracks 
was converted into a school where many subuanos  
received their formal education during World 
War II from 1942 to 1945 Japanese residents  
of the city took Refuge between these walls 
when the battle to liberate the city of Cebu  
from the Imperial Japanese forces was fought 
the fort served as an emergency hospital for  
the wounded from 1946 to 1950 Fort San Pedro was 
an army camp after 1950 the Cebu Garden Club took  
over and fixed the inner parts and converted 
it into a Miniature Garden well that answers  
the palm trees and all the beautiful flowers 
and rose bushes that are found in here it was  
converted into a garden in 1950. what a place what 
a place so there you go a little bit of History  
uh courtesy of Google about the forts of San Pedro 
no man Filipinos love to dance I'm noticing that
so this here is the window where the 
girls were saying hi to me from earlier
you know what the water salesman was right

working out I think I'm at 150 000 subscribers or 
followers whatever you call them Tick Tock friends

platform that I was staying away from for a  
long time because for many about two three years

water over there you know what it's brand new

I'm gonna have to follow him because 
I don't know how to dispose of this
oh there's a trash can right here oh man
there's nothing more fresh refreshing then a 
coconut no every time I drink a coconut like that  
and throw it away all of you guys tell me Chris 
you're supposed to cut it open and eat the inside  
because I'm not really a big fan of 
eating the inside though to be fair  
I'd rather drink the juice drink the milk or 
the coconut water whatever you guys call it and  
then throw it away it's weird because in some 
places of the world they call it coconut milk  
that's inside the coconut in other places they 
call it coconut water let me know what you guys  
call it here in the Philippines and well yeah 
guys I think that's gonna wrap up our little
