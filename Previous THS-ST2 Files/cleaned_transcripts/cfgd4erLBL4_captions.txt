It's like a duck egg with an embryo inside it,

So inside this there's duck? Baby duck?
Yeah, baby duck.

Who wants to be camera man?
Okay. The balut man is the camera man.
So, hopefully this is the top. Let's see what we get here.
Oh, oh, oh, oh!

You just cooked them just now, right?
- Yeah.
Yeah, they're very hot.
Let me...

So hot. Yummy balut.
Yummy balut, ah?
- Yeah.
Sip the sauce.
Sip.
- Okay I'm getting something.
I see something in there. I don't know what it is.
- That is the embryo.
Put some salt.
- Some salt?
Salt, salt, salt, salt.
I see like a little hairy head.
Guys, I see like a little hairy head or something.
I think that's the head. That's the head?
- That's the head.
That's the head. Oh my God.
Oh, it's like a little hairy head.
Okay, so I got some salt here, guys.
Want some sauce?
- Salt bae.
Salt bae for the balut. Okay, some sauce.
So I got some...
It looks like some spicy,
some spicy kinda sauce.
- Balut is very spicy.
I need to peel the whole shell off, right?
- Balut is very spicy.
Oh my God. Look at what is inside here, guys.
Oh, wow.
First time?
- First time, first time ever.
Oh, so it looks like a big...
This bit looks like yolk. So it
looks like just like egg yolk.
Oh and here's the...
Oh, this is the duck. I see the head there.
Look, it's a little head.
- Yeah.
Yeah, it's the embryo.
The duck embryo has a little head there.
Hello little duckie.
Okay, so...
Oh, I can just eat it like this?
- Yeah.
Okay.
Yeah, mmm.
Yummy.
- Balut is very yummy.
Oh, yeah.
- Yummy balut.
It is yummy.
- Balut is very yummy.
Yeah.
It just tastes like a big egg yolk.
I thought there was gonna be like
crunchy bits and bones and feathers.
No, but if I didn't see the duck's head,
I wouldn't know there was a duck
embryo inside it. It's very soft, like jelly.
Yeah.
And this is just like yolk.
How about the yolk?
- Oh, tasty.
Yeah, very fatty and tasty.
Yeah.
Good.
- Balut is yummy.
And this bit is hard.
You can't eat this bit, right?
- Yeah.
It's hard.
So what happens now? I give this to you?
I put this down?
Okay, I put this down.
Oh and then he gives me this to
wash my hands. He's got a little,
a little basin here that I can wash my hands.
Good?
- Thank you, so much.
Yeah, I enjoyed that.
I really, guys...
I really thought that was gonna be like
disgusting or something.
It's not disgusting, it's tasty. It's
just like eating like an egg yolk,
but, like, really intensely flavoured.
Yeah, it was surprising. It's good. It's good.
How much is that for one?
20.
- 20? Only 20? Okay, that's like 35 cents.
It's good.
20.
- Okay.
500.
- 500?
Yeah.
- Oh, what is this?
What is this?
Okay, you can keep the change, brother. It's okay.
Okay. Thank you very much. Okay, guys.
- Thank you.
Where is a good place to eat pares? Pares?
- Pares?
Yeah.
- There.
On this street?
- Go straight ahead.
Okay, I will look on this street.
Okay, thank you, guys.
Very good. Okay.
That's nice.
Mango lady as well. Hi, Mango lady.
Okay.
Lots of street vendors here but, guys,
not as many as I thought there would be.
I came here for the night market.
The Colon Street night market.
This is where I am, I'm on Colon Street.
The oldest street in the Philippines.
And there's, every Friday, Saturday night
and Sunday night there's supposed to be a night market.
But, it's not on. It's not on.
So I'm just walking around
eating stuff.
I'm starting off with the balut.
Now I'm gonna go, oh, here's a pares here.
Paris Pinoy.
Oh, wow, this looks busy.
And no wonder. It's only 49 pesos for a meal,
which is like 90 cents.
And they have other stuff as well.
Actually, that looks way better than the pares.
The pares is like a very simple meal.
It's like a braised beef or whatever
but I need to try the pares
before I leave the Philippines, so
yeah, I guess this is gonna be the place.
This is like the name of the shop.
It's what they specialise in.
Look how busy it is.
Oh maybe I'll try that. The pares overload.
Hey.
- It's like a big, hey how are you?
I came to try the pa..., you eating pares?
You're a blogger.
- Yeah, I'm the blogger. How are you?
Are you eating pares or steak?
Steak.
- Ah steak. I'm gonna try the pares.
I think I will try this one. Okay.
Blogger.
- Okay, blogger. Yes, blogger.
Okay.
Yeah, look how busy this place is, guys.
Ah. It's one of these places where
the guy comes around with the bucket of rice,
giving you free refills of your rice,
right there.
Oh, it's like one meal with beef, right?
- Yeah.
Hot pares with fried garlic.
Oh, and this is with some other stuff.
- Yeah.
Oh, and this one comes with balut.
- Yeah.
Okay.
Okay, I'll have the Pares Overload
that comes with balut. Okay.
99 pesos.
- The Pares Overload.
Yes.
Okay, I'll take the table number. Okay.
- Thank you.
So, it's good.
It's like this in a lot of restaurants in the Philippines.
You pay first and then you just take your
table number and they'll come and bring it to you.
There's no actual tables. I was gonna just rock up here.
In fact, I'll just rock up here.
The place is basically full. Check it out.
Like, all this side is full and then every table is taken.
Very popular,
the old pares.
I ordered a bottle of water as well.
This the Pares Overload?
- Yeah.
Okay.
Water is coming.
Okay guys, a little bit hot in here.
It's not air conditioned, but they've got ceiling fans.
Better than nothing. Oh, there is an AC as well, but they've got it set,
they've got it set to 24.
Okay, so this is my Pares Overload.
There's apparently a balut in there.
I think that's it, that egg right there.
And what pares is, is braised beef.
Thank you sir, thank you so much.
Yeah, pares is braised beef.
And usually comes with rice but I
just didn't order it with the rice, guys.
And they didn't bring me any cutlery or anything.
I don't know how I'm supposed
to eat it. Oh, they have actually got...
I think you have to grab it yourself.
They have forks and stuff.
I just grab this, yeah?
Okay.
They've got spoons and forks here.
There we go.
I think these are the clean ones.
There was like two different sections,
so hopefully this was the clean one.
There's probably like one for the
clean forks and one for the dirty ones, but
they look clean, they look clean.
Okay, let's try the balut first.
I've just eaten balut out on
the street there and it was decent.
Here's another one, right here.
It looks exactly the same as the one I've just eaten.
There's this big yolky part.
Big yellow yolk and then
the little soft duck embryo on top.
Yeah.
To me it just tastes like egg yolk.
Nothing disgusting about balut, guys.
I was scared to try it. I was scared to try it.
But it's good.
Now the beef itself is in this kind of gravy.
More like a soup.
It's more like a soup as you can see, like a beef stew.
I thought this was gonna be
more of a, more dry, just pieces of beef.
It's apparently braised beef and a
popular... I think mostly popular at lunchtime,
this is dinner time,
meal with the local Filipinos. Let's give it a go.
Oh, guys, that's tasty.
Very peppery gravy and the beef, it's like tender
but the outside of it's crispy, like it's been
like seared on the outside or something.
Very, very, very savoury,
very peppery,
salty,
delicious chunks of beef.
Guys, I still have this part of the balut.
It's like rock hard.
It looks like it's like an egg white
or something but it's actually rock hard.
And this part was there as well
when I got the one out on the street
and it was just too hard to eat, so...
Yeah, I don't know if that's supposed to be discarded or
you're supposed to try and break
your teeth crunching through it or not.
I don't know but I'm leaving it and I'm concentrating on
these thin, slices of braised, delicious beef.
Yum, yum.
And the gravy, oh.
Really, I just wish it had some Yorkshire pudding guys.
Some Yorkshire pudding.
Just soaking this gravy into
some Yorkshire pudding would be perfect.
I finished it guys.
I've got all the chunks of beef out of here.
I don't know if I'm supposed to
drink this gravy like a soup or what.
I could do but then again it's more like a gravy.
You wouldn't drink a gravy.
You would just leave it, if you
had no more food left to soak it into, so
I think that's what I'm gonna do and
I'm happy that I didn't eat rice with it.
It means my stomach is still fairly empty.
I can go out and eat more food, guys.
So that's good.
Okay, we're getting a
selfie with the three lovely ladies.
Oh, so cute.
- Thank you.
You're so handsome.
- Oh, thank you.
One handsome guy and three cute
girls are taking a selfie together.
Okay, let's do it. Let's do it.
One, two, three...
Okay, nice to see you.
I just ate this pares. It's very nice.
You tried before?
- Yeah.
Hi, how are you?
Yeah.
Okay, bye-bye.
See you.
Okay, so cute.
So cute.
- Thank you.
So cute.
Hi, how are you?
- We wanna take a picture.
Ah, okay.
Want to take a picture?
- Yes.
But he's wearing a mask. You can't take a picture with a mask.
You need to take off for the picture.
Okay.
You watch on YouTube? Ah, okay.
Most Filipinos are watching on Facebook.
But you're watching on YouTube. You're good.
I always watch you on Youtube.
- YouTube? Good.
Okay, that's the original.
That's the OG style. YouTube.
Okay, thank you so much, guys. Have a nice night.
That was delicious guys. That Pares Pinoy.
I see a lot of these around. I think this is like a branch of another one.
There's a lot of chain restaurants around
that don't exist in other countries like that Mang Inasal.
And you just keep seeing them again and again and again
when you're walking around and think, "Ah, this must be popular."
So, yeah, the same with this, this Paris Pinoy.
It was good.
So, it looks like this is gonna be a food vlog.
Guys, as I said, I was originally
here to make a night market vlog.
I was gonna eat some stuff,
buy some random souvenirs and stuff to take away with me.
I'm coming towards the end of my trip to the Philippines.
But the night market is not here,
so I think what I'm gonna do is I'm just gonna try
and tick off all the things that I haven't eaten.
The pares, that's me ticked that off.
I've also got to try the Bulalo and Lechon.
Well, lechon, that's something I'm gonna have to try
like in the morning or early afternoon
while they're still roasting the pig, so
this is gonna be another
one of these multi-day vlogs, guys.
One of these vlogs.
It'll continue tomorrow.
Right now, I'm still hungry.
I didn't have rice with that pares,
so I can eat something else right now.
And the last time I was here,
there was some little bakery that had really
good-looking cakes and stuff.
This time, I brought my little bag.
So... Hi, Hello!
This time I brought my little bag
so I can actually buy stuff and take it away with me.
So if I see that bakery that's on this street somewhere,
if it's still open in the night time,
I'm gonna buy all those ube treats from there,
guys, but yeah, this street, a lot quieter
than I was expecting it to be.
This was supposed to be closed off to cars
and there was supposed to be all these tents
with vendors all the way down the street.
I'd seen pictures of it, I'd seen videos of it,
I'd seen news articles of it, but
yeah, apparently it's just not happening now,
for some reason. I don't know why.
Why you keep your mask on?
Your friend took her mask off.
You're so cute, you should
always take your mask off for a photo.
Okay, now we get a proper photo.
Okay, nice one. Okay.
Oh, you just want one together.
Like we're a couple or something.
That's what people are gonna think.
Look, we're hugging.
Little couple.
Okay, nice one.
Oh, and you as well.
Another couple. I've changed already.
You're dumped and now I'm with this one.
Okay, nice to see you girls. Take care, have a nice night.
- Thank you.
I'm just walking around and eating and stuff.
Okay, see you, bye-bye.
- Thank you, bye.
Okay, that is nice.
The one girl wanted to take the photo with her
stupid corona mask on. Come on.
Take it off for the photo at
least, especially when you're a cutie.
Especially when you're a cute girl.
You gotta take the mask off.
Right. Oh, that's it. That's the bakery,
right across the street.
That's it. I think it was called Patty's or something like that.
Uh oh, I better watch the traffic.
But right across the street here.
That's it there, Patty's.
Okay.
Gonna buy some of the
ube treats. I wasn't sure if this would still be open.
But here it is, Patty's.
Let's see what they've got left.
So they've got less stuff than they did
when I was walking past before,
but there is still plenty of cool stuff like ube rolls
and ube everything.
I'm gonna ask them what the favourites are.
Hello, girls.
Hi, sir. How are you?
Fine.
- What are the favourites?
What?
- The best ones, the best cakes?
I like ube. I like ube.
Ube, we have.
- Yeah, you have ube roll, right?
Yeah, we have ube roll and we have ube bar, also.
This one.
- Ube ball?
Ube bar, yeah.
- Can you show me?
Yeah, okay.
Okay.
It's our famous here, in Patty's bake shop.
Ube bar and ube roll.
Oh, these are the famous ones?
Yeah.
- Ube bar and ube roll.
Ube roll?
- Everything in here, our breads, it's famous.
Ah, okay. So she's saying these
are famous. Oh, it's here already?
Oh, wow, it's big.
- Yeah.
So this is ube bar?
- Yeah.
Can I see?
- Yeah.
It has...
- Ah, wow.
This is one portion or it gets cut up?
- No, it's one portion only.
That's one portion?
- Yeah.
Really? Oh my God. It looks so big.
- 12 pesos.
Yeah.
- Ah, okay.
It's affordable.
So ube bar, okay, I will take one ube bar
and one ube roll.
This is the ube rolls here.
Only 12, only 12 pesos each.
- Yeah.
And what is this one different here?
Ah, this one.
Yeah, this one and this one. Yeah, I'll take the,
yeah, I'll take all the purple ones.
All the purple ones, guys.
I will take.
Yeah.
So,
what have I got now?
I've got ube bar.
Ube roll and yo-yo.
And yo-yo?
- Yeah, that one.
The one that...
- The circle one?
Yeah, circle one.
- Ah, okay, that's the yo-yo.
They've got "roll" there but it's yo-yo.
Ah, okay, and what else should I take?
Maybe one more thing that's not ube.
Ah.
How about popiah or binangkal?
Okay, I will take.
Or this one sir. Cheesy mamon.
What is it? Cheese?
- Cheesy mamon.
Yeah.
- Okay, I'll have one of these
as well please.
And maybe one more thing.
Maybe one more thing.
Because I'm greedy.
What looks good guys?
These sesame seed looking balls.
Or these pastry looking things.
That's fairly just normal.
There's cheese cupcakes.
There's these. I wonder what this is, here.
This looks strange.
And these, like, UFO type things.
It has cheese or no?
- No.
What is it?
- That's not cheese.
Just sponge?
Yeah, it's just sponge. Ah, looks very normal.
Maybe I'll try.
What about this one here that looks like a sandwich?
- Big Bite.
Big Bite?
- Yeah.
Inside is what?
It has spring onions.
Ah, no, I want sweet sweet.
- Ah, sweets.
Yeah.
That's all, sir.
These are sweet?
That one, yes.
It has also spring onions inside like Big Bite.
Ah, no, I need like sweet-sweet.
Something without onions or spring onions.
What about this?
Torta.
Raisins.
It's only raisins.
It's all sweet, yeah?
- Yeah.
Ah okay. You said it's called tartar?
Torta, yeah.
- Tartar? Okay, one tartar please.
Okay.
So that should be enough.
- Okay.
It's 56.
- 66, only?
No, it's 56.
- 56, only?
That's even less. Oh, wow.
Do you have 6 peso sir?
- 6? No, I gave all my change to the pares shop. Sorry.
Careful your things.
- Wow. Yes.
Careful.
Oh, someone...
She's telling me to be careful with my camera.
Like maybe someone will just run past and grab it.
I dunno.
Everyone's so friendly, so far.
This street is Colon Street, a lot of, you know...
Oh Colon Street, a little bit dangerous, or?
- Yeah.
Ah, okay, everyone has been so friendly so far,
but it only takes one person to be bad, you know?
You know? If one person is bad then it can be a problem.
- Thank you, sir.
Okay, thank you, so much.
- Yeah, thank you.
Thank you. I will go try my bakery.
Okay, thank you.
- Enjoy, come back again.
Okay, that's good. I got my sweet treats from Patty's.
And a little warning that I need to
be a bit careful around here.
It was so hot standing there. I need to get into the,
the fresh air. That's better.
Oh, I dunno how they can,
they can stand working in a bakery.
It's like they've got the
ovens on and it's just like so hot.
But yeah, I'm gonna take these back to my hotel to
try them out but
in the meantime I'm gonna
find something else to eat right here on Colon Street.
Although it seems absolutely dead, right now.
Most of the businesses are
closing down for the day.
There's a little mall here.
One across the street as well.
I'm just gonna jump in and soak up some air conditioning.
Guys, always a good idea.
Always a good idea when you're
walking the streets in these
tropical countries.
Nip into a mall. Hi, po.
So, I've no idea what's in here
at all and I don't care.
I absolutely don't care, as
long as it's got air conditioning.
Which it does.
Oh, there are a few like
little stalls and stuff
around. Oh, I've went straight into a food court, guys.
This looks good. The blue lemonade.
It's cold, yeah?
Oh, okay, that's what I need.
- Closed.
Oh, you can't serve me one lemonade?
It's okay.
- You can sell me?
Okay, good.
They're closed. But I'm not here for food.
They normally sell mozzarella sticks.
Oh, these are good. I have
them at the night market sometimes.
One lemonade?
- One lemonade, yeah, the blue one. Thank you.
So you're just closing for today?
30 pesos.
- 30 pesos, okay.
Okay, thank you so much.
- Thank you.
Thank you. Okay.
Blue lemonade. Cool me down.
Oh, guys, that's what you need.
Some artificial sweetness. Nice and cold.
Very refreshing.
Okay.
I'm gonna get back out onto the streets and have
a look around for this bulalo.
I don't see it anywhere on the Google Maps.
Like, I don't see a specialty restaurant.
I don't see any restaurant with bulalo in its name.
So I don't know how successful I'm gonna be.
Also, everything's closing
down right about now as well, so...
Yeah, it's probably gonna be a fail but
I'll down this,
get out and have a wee look.
Have a look
in here. It looks like,
it says "supermarket" but it looks like a wee mall,
as well. Maybe I'll find,
maybe I will find
bulalo. Hi, how are you?
Hi.
Entrance?
- Yeah.
Hello po.
I'm looking for bulalo.
- Bulalo?
Yeah, any place selling bulalo?
Oh, bulalo?
- Yeah.
On Colon Street?
Yeah ???? bulalo
No.
- No?
???? bulalo.
No in here? Ah, okay, he says not in here. Okay.
Not in the market.
Yeah, there are a few like little
cafes and restaurants and stuff
inside but he says not in the market.
Darn it.
Hey she wants to take a picture with you.
- Hi, how are you?
She wants to do what with me?
Take a picture? Okay, we can do that.
- Really?
Guys, I'm looking for bulalo.
You think I can find here on Colon Street or?
- Pares.
Pares? I ate Paris already.
I ate Paris already.
I'm looking for bulalo.
Bulalo, nobody knows bulalo?
I thought this was like a famous Filipino food.
Bulalo.
- We don't know where...
You don't know?
Okay.
Well, guys,
maybe this bulalo isn't as famous as I thought it was.
I heard it was like one of the main Filipino,
one of the main Filipino foods.
Okay.
Nice to see you guys. Nice to see you. Okay.
- Bye-bye.
Maybe it's just because they're...
Maybe it's just because they're young guys
and girls, that they eat different foods.
Like they eat McDonald's and Jollibees
and they don't eat like stuff like
bulalo.
I don't know.
Is this gonna be like one of these missions?
Like when I tried to find
the Filipino
national team's football top
and I spent like two days looking for it
and I couldn't find it anywhere.
Is it gonna be like that? By the way,
I have ordered the Philippines national football
top from Shopee
and it's gonna be delivered
hopefully before I leave
Cebu.
Hopefully it's gonna be delivered before I leave Cebu.
So watch out. Maybe you'll...
Maybe you'll see it in this vlog
if I continue this vlog tomorrow.
It might actually arrive tomorrow guys.
It's a...
I've been tracking it and it's at some warehouse
in Cebu.
Some, like,
distribution centre,
like for the courier,
for the postal company.
So there is a chance that
you might actually see it
in this very vlog, the Philippines national
football top.
We will see. We will see.
And now
I will keep seeing
if I can find bulalo.
What is he playing? ML?
Yeah.
It's
Mobile legends but he's got it like
the screen is going onto here.
- No
This is YouTube.
Oh this is YouTube? Ah, so he's watching
like someone else play but
also he's playing himself as well.
Yeah.
- Addict, addict.
Oh look at his keyboard.
You got the RGB.
RGB keyboard. Oh, very nice.
And two monitors.
Oh, very cool.
Nice one.
Ah, okay. So this like internet cafe?
- No.
Oh, it's like a repair.
But you guys are working here?
- Yeah.
Ah, but when no customers you just play?
- Yeah.
Okay, it's good.
Nice to see you, bro. Thank you.
Okay, that's cool.
Some video game addicts,
right there.
Okay, guys.
If I'm gonna be walking around looking for something,
I might as well be in an air conditioned mall so,
I've just called a grab
that's gonna take me to the Ayala Centre
which is the fancy mall that's right next to my hotel so...
Oh, my driver's calling.
Hello.
Yeah, that is him
right there.
Hi po.
Can I sit in the front? It's okay?
- Yeah.
Okay.
Sorry.
It's a difficult place for pickup, I know.
- Ah, yeah.
Sorry about that.
Okay, so I'm going to the mall.
- Yeah.
Yeah, we're right here.
- Okay. Fantastic.
So he gave me some suggestions for
Lechon.
I was asking him about bulalo.
He doesn't know one for bulalo, but yeah we're here at
this fancy mall and it closes in 25 minutes so
yeah it's maybe a waste of time
but at least it's close to my hotel.
Hi po.
Thank you.
I thought there would be a
section in here that would be like that
Robinson's Mall in Manila, in Malate that I was staying at
where there'd be loads of nice restaurants in a row
but here it looks like...
Yeah, it's all like Burger King,
McDonald's, probably Jollibee is there or KFC.
Just the usual guys.
Yeah, Jollibee is there as well.
Yeah, just the usual junk food.
I need like a fairly nice restaurant to find this bulalo.
I think there is more up and down here. Okay.
Like I said this mall is about to close so
on Google Maps anyway, it says 9 pm.
Most of the malls in Asia are closed like 10 pm
but this one it said 9 pm on Google Maps.
Although people do still seem to be,
you know, like settled and sitting and eating so
I don't know there's a chance guys, there's a chance.
I've had that before, Chowking.
It's like Chinese food. The orange chicken is very good.
The orange chicken and the orange pork.
Oh, Kenny Rogers Roasters.
That went bankrupt in the
United States but you still see them
in Philippines and Malaysia.
I've had that in Malaysia before,
but yeah I think it's like long, long,
long ago it was bankrupt in the
United States and now Kenny Rogers himself,
the man himself has sadly passed away.
Yeah, pizza hut.
Yeah, that's it guys, it's just the
just the junk food.
Is there more? Is there more?
I don't think so.
Dairy Queen.
What is out here?
Some kind of terrace area,
with one restaurant, Casa Verde.
I think that's Italian by the sounds of it.
Yeah, it's like a steak restaurant.
Don't think I'm gonna get
bulalo here.
Looking for bulalo. Looking for bulalo.
Unfortunately we don't have bulalo.
Do you know if I can get it in this mall with bulalo?
Can I ask, sir, are you a blogger?
Yes I'm blogger, how are you?
I'm a subscriber your.
You're a subscriber? Oh, okay good.
Nino, Nino.
I'm looking for... Hey, doesn't Nino mean small?
You're big.
- Yes.
Look, guys.
He's big.
He's not Nino?
Can I shout out my family?
- Okay shout out to Nino's family.
Shout out, shout out.
- Shout out to my family, Gitgano family.
Okay, good.
Guys, do you know where I can find bulalo,
in this mall?
- Bulalo?
Yes, sir, we have here.
Yeah, this is not bulalo.
Like a bone marrow.
Yeah the bone marrow, but I want the
the proper, proper Filipino bulalo.
Yes, we have
Pochero, this is with meat.
Pochero? This is
Pochero with meat.
This is bone marrow?
- Yes.
It's like Cebu version of bulalo?
- Yes.
Yes, sir.
- But you call it Pochero?
Yes.
- Ah, okay good.
So you've got "soup only," that's just the broth.
And they've got with meat.
Not available, soup only.
Not available, soup only? Only with meat?
Yes, with meat.
- Ah, okay.
And we have a boneless Pochero, is all meat.
Oh, boneless Pochero,
doesn't have the bone marrow?
- Yes, yes.
There's no bone marrow?
- Yeah, all meat.
All meat? Ah, I need the bone marrow.
Yeah.
So, yeah, I will get this, the Pochero,
Pochero with meat. You're still open, yes?
- Yes.
Okay, good.
Oh, nice and cold in here.
I like it.
That's a big difference. Okay, nice one.
Thank you so much, Beverly.
Thank you.
- Okay.
Okay.
Oh, nice one.
Here our menu.
- Okay.
This is the menu.
Okay, so I already know I'm
getting the Pochero with meat, regular.
And then I just need something to drink.
Mmm, we have a...
Oh, gulaman.
...a big, it is a pitcher and we have a glass.
Okay, I'll just take the iced
tea. And I can get bottomless, right?
Which means I can get refills.
- Mmm, iced tea bottomless.
Yeah, iced tea bottomless.
Thank you.
Okay, I'm looking forward.
- Do you want to eat
rice?
- No, it's okay.
Yeah.
- Okay, no rice.
Yeah, but Filipino will always take rice, right?
- Okay.
If they're Filipino.
But me, I don't need. Me, I don't need.
Okay, thank you Nino.
Okay, guys, when I search Google
for Pochero, it comes up "Pochero Bulalo."
So this is definitely the Cebu version.
It's like Cebu style Bulalao
comes up when I search for Pochero so,
yeah, it looks like I'm getting the right thing.
I might just get like a slightly
different variation of it when I'm in Manila.
But, yeah. That's fortunate.
It's fortunate I stumbled upon this place
because I would have kept asking people
"Where is bulalo, where is bulalo?"
and I would never have found it.
It's Pochero here, Pochero.
Okay, my Pochero... Oh, wow, it's big.
I didn't think it was gonna be so big.
This is like for sharing.
- Yes.
Okay.
So.
- Meat from Chika An.
Okay, so how do I eat this? I eat
from here or I put on the plate?
Mmm. You can...
Ah, okay.
- And can transfer it to your plate.
And I put the broth in here.
Can you help me?
Because I'm gonna make such a mess.
Bro, I will make such a mess if I try to tackle this.
It's like one huge lump of meat.
And the bone marrow is in there as well.
Yeah, inside the bone.
So this is beef.
Yes.
- Big chunk of beef.
Oh, I can see the bone marrow.
It's this, right? The chewy stuff.
Yeah, it's all glistening.
You taste it, the meat.
You can think, "Oh."
You think it's delicious, the meat?
- Yes, yes.
Yeah, it looks good. It looks so soft.
- It's very good.
Yeah, I can see.
Maybe tomorrow you come back here.
- Again?
Maybe every day I will eat, do you think?
Okay, we will see.
- Try, try.
We will see. Okay, you want me to try?
Okay, he wants me to try this beef right here.
Let's give it a go.
- Okay.
Oh, wow.
Yeah.
- Yeah.
He knows, he knows. Yeah.
-Uh-huh, uh-huh.
It's so soft.
Mouth watering.
Yeah, it's like roast beef.
Yeah, very.
Boombalabap, you say it.
Boombalabap?
- Yeah.
Okay, does it mean it's delicious?
Yes, you can eat again and..
- Yeah
Boombalabap.
- And then after you eat, you can say,
"Boombalabap."
Say again boom?
- Boombalabap.
Boombalabap?
- Yeah, Boombalabap.
Okay.
Okay, okay. Boombalabap.
- Mmm.
Boombalabap.
Okay.
- Thank you, brother.
Thank you.
- Okay.
Yeah, guys, it just tastes like the...
Oh my God.
Yeah, it just tastes like the roast beef
that you would have in the UK.
There's no weird spices.
There's no, nothing weird.
Like, this is like,
this is something that
could be in British cuisine, actually.
A very usual taste,
but more moist than, like if I was eating roast beef
on like a Sunday dinner or something like that,
it's just so moist, obviously because it's in a soup.
And I was expecting...
Okay, good. Yeah.
So I got the bottomless,
I got the bottomless iced tea, so,
it just keeps getting refilled. That's good.
Yeah, I was expecting this to be in a big bowl
and I'd be eating it from the bowl, but this is massive.
Normally people sharing this?
- Yeah?
Normally people sharing?
- Mmm, good for 3 to 4 persons.
3 to 4 persons or one hungry Scotsman.
This for
one hungry blogger. Okay, that's good.
There's a lot of meat. There's a lot of meat in here, guys.
That's just, that's a lot on its own.
You know, if you had that with some
rice and vegetables, but look at this.
And that's what I wanna get stuck into there, the,
the bone marrow.
I gotta try the broth though.
Oh, very, very oniony.
Oniony?
Oh, like cabbage. Tastes like cabbage.
Is there cabbage in there?
Oh, yeah, it's bok choy.
It's the Chinese cabbage.
That's what it tastes like. It's like a,
that's the most prominent taste
is the bok choy, in this broth.
Oh, there's some corn as well.
As you can see, there's some corn.
Yeah, the two, the two flavours
complement each other well.
The beefiness
and the soup.
Guys, this is the type of meal I'd like to eat after
a hard workout.
Like, if I'd just been to the gym, this would be perfect.
It's just all protein, all protein.
Now,
I want to see
if I can get this bone marrow
out of here.
Is there a way? Do I just stick the knife in?
Oh, yeah, look at that.
Oh ho ho ho ho.
Look at that guys.
Right there.
I can just dig in and scrape this out.
Scrape this bone marrow out.
Let's get it together with the tender, tender
meat.
Lovely jubbly, guys.
Lovely jubbly.
Okay, he's helping me again.
I tried to scrape some of the bone marrow out.
It's good. Yeah.
Wow.
It is a good taste?
- Yeah, it's a good taste there, in the middle, yeah.
You want me to taste on its own?
- Yeah.
Okay. The bone marrow on its own.
Oh, wow.
This is what I'm saying.
- Yeah, it's delicious.
It's delicious.
- It is delicious, yeah.
Wow.
And that's all getting soaked into the soup.
Yeah, it's all getting mixed into this beef, tender, tender.
How about the meat?
The meat is very tender, very soft.
Yeah, so soft.
How about the soup, sir?
- Yeah, very nice.
It tastes like the bok choy, the Chinese cabbage.
Yeah, this vegetable.
Yeah, it's nice.
It's a nice taste.
- Corn?
No, I haven't tried it yet, yeah.
I haven't tried the corn.
Okay.
- Yeah.
Sir, I can...
- Okay, yeah, sure, you can put it in the soup.
Okay, this is good.
Later, just inform me that...
Oh, you can help me again?
- Yes.
Okay, thank you, so much. Very good service.
Nino, thank you.
Okay, that's good.
Thank you.
- Thank you, so much.
Like, I didn't even have to ask.
He's helping me chop it all up and everything.
I would have made such a mess on my own, guys.
Trying, you can imagine, you can imagine.
You can imagine the kind of mess that I would get into,
trying to carve that up.
Especially if I had the camera in one hand.
Oh my God.
This fatty bit right here.
How much meat have I got left?
I'm eating quickly. I'm eating quickly.
Yeah.
Oh, wow. That's all fat.
I think it's all fat.
Can I transfer it to your plate sir?
- You wanna transfer the whole thing to my plate?
Oh my God, look at this.
Look at the size of this. Wow.
Okay, so I'm just gonna carve
bits of meat off of this now, this bone.
- Yes, sir.
Yeah, see if there's any bone
marrow left inside. I don't know.
But, uh, yeah.
That's what I've eaten.
That was covered in meat.
And we've almost,
we've almost got it all.
Yeah.
Just trying not to waste any.
Especially the bone marrow.
And then you can...
- Yeah, I think...
Like that.
You can, yeah, like suck it. Yeah, suck it out.
Yeah.
- This gonna have soup.
Okay, at the end, I will do this.
Yes, last, I will do this.
Okay, thank you, Nino. Thank you.
Okay, good.
Those fatty bits that are right next to the bone.
Oh my God.
Okay, guys, I've pretty much got all the meat off this.
It's just fat that's left.
As you can see,
pretty much scraped it all off, so the last thing to do,
the last thing to do, guys, is to pick it up
and suck out the remainder of the bone marrow, right here.
I think I got it all.
I think I got it all,
guys.
Pretty much. Oh, no, I didn't.
Okay.
I'm just trying not to waste any,
any of it, at all, guys.
But, yeah, I've got it all.
Nino, can I get the bill please?
Thank you, so much.
That was fantastic.
Left a bit of a mess of the table, but
not as much of a mess as if I had to carve that up
on my own, guys.
Okay.
So we are 600 total.
Okay, there is 1,000. You can keep
the change for the staff. Okay?
Thank you, sir.
- Okay, no problem. My pleasure.
Thank you so much for helping me. Thank you.
Okay, good.
See you, guys. See you next time.
Thank you.
- Can I take a photo for you?
Photo? Ah, okay. What's the name of the restaurant?
Chika An.
- Chika An?
Ah, yeah, Chika An.
- Chika An, okay.
Okay.
- Okay, yeah, we can take a photo.
Okay, good. Okay, and you, and you, okay.
Okay, good. Nice one. See you guys next time.
Okay, see you.
See you, bye.
- Thank you.
Okay, that was nice.
I forgot the name of the place already. Oh, there.
Chika An, sa Cebu.
So, yeah, that was an unexpected discovery.
I was just wandering around the mall and
I was looking at that and it
looked like an Italian restaurant
and then I just wandered to that menu.
And it looked like they didn't have what I was looking for,
the bulalo, but then I found
out that the bulalo in Cebu is pochero.
And then I had the pochero and it was delicious.
And great success, guys. Great success.
And the plan now is to try
and find my way out of this mall, guys.
If I can find a way out, they don't seem to give you the exit.
It's like a Las Vegas casino.
You're just wandering around in circles.
You're wandering around all over the place,
trying to find your way out.
And they deliberately make it difficult to do so,
but I want to go back to my hotel room to eat dessert.
That's right.
I haven't forgotten that in this backpack right here,
there is four or five.
Was it four or five?
There's either four or five snacks,
ube and the other sweet
stuff that I got, some raisin thing.
But, yeah, I gotta try them out.
I gotta try them out. They look beautiful,
especially those deep purple-coloured ube ones.
So, yeah, let's take a walk over
to the Holiday Inn and try them out, guys.
Yes, guys.
Back here in my air-conditioned
hotel room to enjoy these five sweet treats
along with my can of Coke Zero Vanilla.
Guys, we have got right here, the ube roll.
The raisin thing.
We've got the ube slice.
We have the cheese bun and the ube ball,
I believe it was called. I think it's a ball, an ube ball.
But, anyway, three ube treats and two others.
Most looking forward to the ube ones, guys.
I'm just gonna take a couple of
bites out of each just for the taste.
Get my reaction.
I don't wanna eat five cakes for my dessert, guys.
I don't wanna do that.
So I will be saving the rest for breakfast tomorrow
when I wake up late after
the breakfast in the hotel closes,
as I do almost every day when I'm travelling, guys.
10 o'clock. They always cut off at 10 o'clock.
Who wakes up and gets down for breakfast by 10 o'clock?
Not yer man. Not yer man when he's on vacation.
And he's on vacation all the time,
so all the time he misses his breakfast.
I need to find a hotel where they
keep breakfast open till like 11 or something.
I could do the compromise at 11. Roll out of bed at 10.30.
Go for my breakfast.
Aye, that would be decent.
I don't know if any hotels do that.
Maybe kind of like vacation hotels.
But not business hotels like this one.
Anyway, I'm gonna get stuck
in. And over here at the tea station,
we have some little spoons.
I didn't have a plate or anything like that.
I did clean the table before putting these down.
This is where I've been setting up my laptop.
There's no other really, well
there's no other table in this room.
It's just this coffee table that I
have to use for everything. Eating and working.
But let's give this a go, this ube...
Oh, it's nice and soft.
Like it feels kinda soggy.
It's all glistening with bits of sugar.
Is this a mouthful or should I chop it up even more?
It's a mouthful, it's a
mouthful when you've got a big mouth.
It's like a sponge cake.
It's like a soft sugary sponge cake.
And the taste of ube is not that strong.
So it's just like a sweet sponge cake. It's alright.
It could do with some cream or something.
Some ube jam. Some jam or cream in the middle.
It would be perfect.
Is there anything in the middle?
No, it is just that.
Yeah, some clotted cream that you'd have with a scone.
If you ate it with that,
oh and a wee bit of jam, like a blueberry jam.
Or an ube jam, if you can get ube jam.
It would be perfect.
Now this actually looks like a scone.
This actually looks like a British style scone,
right here. It's softer than a scone though.
It does have the raisins.
Yeah, again,
it's just wheat.
It's just like your regular kind of like wheat spongy cake
with sugar and raisins.
Okay, nothing that special.
Let's try this, the ube slice.
Is it just gonna be the same but like a different shape?
This one's a roll.
And this one's a slice.
Oh, this one I think has got some cream in the middle.
Has it or not?
I don't know. Check it out.
This tastes like what you would
get out of a bakery shop in Scotland.
It's called a snowball.
You get something called a snowball.
And the reason is, it's all this
desiccated coconut that's around it.
So it's like an ube sponge with desiccated coconut,
rather than that one which was just sugar.
So that's that one.
Now this, cheese.
Cheese, oh it's so soft.
Oh, it's so light. It doesn't weigh anything.
I think she said there was cream
or something or maybe it's made with cream.
It's so light. This weighs nothing.
So it's a fluffy light kinda bun
that's got cheese on top.
Yeah, it doesn't really taste of anything,
apart from the cheese, the cheddary cheese.
It's alright.
Now I think this is gonna be the
best one, this UFO shaped ube ball, guys.
Let's give this a taste.
And all of this, the full lot,
the five of them together, 56 pesos, 1 US dollar.
That's a bargain. So you're talking 20 cents each.
20 cents per cake. It's a bargain guys.
Let's, I was hoping there was something in the middle.
They don't have anything in the
middle like cream or jam or something.
They are cheap, so I'm not complaining,
but all of these would be better with cream.
Like if there was cream in that.
I think this is made with cream
but if there was something like custard in the middle of that,
cream and ube jam in that.
You know, just cream, cream and jam, cream and jam.
That's why you need. You need something to go with your...
You can't just... We would call this, in Scotland,
something like that, we'd call it "stodge."
It's just like, it's just all wheat and,
yeah, it needs a bit of something else,
something else to it.
Anyway, let's try this one.
Oh, yeah.
That's the sweetest one.
And it's more dense as well.
It's like, it looks thin, but it's like,
it's like that but it's like been compressed or something.
It's very dense.
I like this one the best, guys.
I like this one the best.
Anyway, I'm gonna bid you guys farewell for now.
I'm gonna eat a bit more of this, not too much more.
I am tempted to just sit here and
graze, but I've still got the,
I've still got the wrappers for it.
I'm gonna put some of it away
and keep it for my breakfast tomorrow.
And yeah, tomorrow, or the next day, or the next day,
kinda depends on the weather and stuff,
but I will be continuing this vlog.
I will be going back out and I
will be looking for the pork lechon,
because I guarantee you one thing,
this vlog will not end until I have eaten lechon.
I won't leave Philippines until I've eaten lechon.
It would be a crime.
And it's a new day guys and a very happy new day for
yer man right here, for two reasons.
Two reasons. Can you notice the two reasons?
Maybe you can notice one or
two of the two reasons, right here.
The first reason yer man is happy on this new day is,
check out yer man's digs, right here.
He has been upgraded.
I've got a proper working desk now, guys.
If you had seen the previous vlog,
when I did the room tour here at the Holiday Inn,
you would have noticed that the room was a bit small.
It kinda came to, it was kinda the same room,
but it just kinda like came to here
and there was no room for a working desk.
I just had to have my laptop up on the coffee table,
which wasn't very comfortable.
But, I finally got the upgrade here on my third day.
So the way it is at IHG hotels is,
normally I will get an upgrade without asking for it.
Normally when I check in...
I usually just book the cheapest room,
because I'm diamond status.
I'm the top tier in the loyalty scheme with IHG.
So I normally just book the cheapest room
and I get some sort of upgrade,
either deluxe room, suite, something like that.
But then sometimes hotels are fully booked
and sometimes hotels are stingy
and they just don't give you the upgrade.
I think in the terms and conditions
it's at the hotel's discretion.
So, I'm not sure what happened at this hotel.
Either the hotel's stingy
or they didn't have any better rooms available.
But I finally got it guys. I finally got it, here
on my third day and I'm much more comfortable
now, sitting at my proper working desk,
with my proper office chair, right there, with the nice view.
I'm on the top floor, I'm in a corner room.
Everything, everything is good.
This is a bit annoying.
There's a big nasty piece of sellotape
on the other side of the window there.
That's kind of, actually, annoying when
you're trying to enjoy the view.
But it is a good view here from the 20th floor.
You can see there's all these modern buildings
and there's kind of like a slum area right next to it.
Right down there. You can see the contrast.
In fact, that kinda slumish area
is in the middle of, like, all these condos
and office buildings
and suchlike.
That's interesting.
Anyway guys, that's one of the two reasons
why yer man's happy on this new day.
Can you see the other reason?
Can you see the other reason why yer man is happy?
Yes, he is wearing the Azkals
Philippines National Football Top.
I finally got it. The delivery came today to the hotel.
I got the notification from Shopee
and I went down and the reception had signed for it.
It was there waiting for me. So I finally got it.
I'm representing the Philippines National Team
and number 8.
Do you guys know who number 8 is
for the Philippines National Team?
I'm betting most of the Filipinos who
are watching don't even know who he is
but I'll turn my back and show you.
It is Mr Ott, Manny Ott.
So Manny Ott plays for some team
in the Malaysia Super League
and he's German but... He grew up in Germany,
he has a German father, but he has a Filipino mother
and that's why he plays for the National Team.
So Manny Ott, number 8.
I am representing you, mate, right now.
I'm gonna go out with this top on.
Finally, I get to roam the streets with the National Team's
jersey. That's what I wanted
to do from the start of the trip.
That's what I wanted to do, but I didn't get to do it.
I did my whole Indonesia series
half the videos I was wearing the Indonesia football top
and I couldn't do that in the Philippines.
I think when I'm out and about
people aren't even gonna know that
this is a Philippines national top.
It doesn't say Philippines
on it apart from, like, on the badge.
But, yeah, I'm gonna go out.
It's actually fairly late in the day.
It's 4.20 pm.
The reason I'm leaving it a little bit later
than I thought I was gonna do to go out
and eat lechon, that is the plan.
I was gonna do it, kinda like early in the morning,
so I could find one of these places
and the pig was still roasting.
But, when the staff were moving me to the new room,
they suggested some new night market,
called Carbon Night Market.
That's, it's near the ferry port where I arrived in Cebu.
And apparently it's a little bit kinda clean and fancy
and it's popular now.
It's quite a popular night market.
So I looked it up on Google Maps
and I seen there was like a couple
of guys selling lechon there.
So I'm feeling like if I go there,
you know, as soon as the night market begins,
they will have like the big old pig right there.
I can choose which piece of the pig that I want.
That's what I want. That's what I want to do, guys.
Apparently this night market, it starts at 5 o'clock
but then some news articles say it starts at 4 o'clock.
So I didn't know what time to like head over there
but I'm just gonna head over there now.
I think I should be there in like half an hour.
So I'll be there just before 5 o'clock.
And yeah guys, let's do it.
Let's go to the Carbon Night Market here in Cebu.
So this is the Carbon Market
but it's not the Carbon Night Market.
Guys, this is like the Carbon Public Market.
I don't know where the night market is.
It's 5 pm on the dot right now,
so wherever it is it should be starting right now.
Hey guys.
- Hey guys, what's up?
Okay, gonna look around.
So I came down here because I seen these like tents.
And on Google Maps for Carbon Night Market,
which the location is like here.
It's like right here.
I don't get it. It should be here.
All the stalls had these red kind of roof tents.
And yeah, it should be here.
Have I done it like two days in a row?
Two days in a row have I turned
up to night markets that don't exist?
Is that what I've done?
How are you? Hi, hi.
Where's the night market? Night market?
Full of drink.
Okay, he doesn't know.
Night market?
- Night Market.
In there?
Okay, thank you. Oh, go around?
Okay, thank you po. Thank you.
Okay.
Night market is around.
Okay.
This is like a flower section, here, of the market.
Hello.
And
Yeah.
It's a kinda cool area.
I wish I had came and checked this out during the daytime.
All these stalls seem to be closing.
Hello.
- Hello.
Oh, there is some food, right here.
Some kind of grilled meat, sweets and such like.
I want to find the...
Hello.
- Hello.
Actual proper night market, which it looked kind of fancy.
This... Oh my God.
It looked kinda fancy on the
map, on the Google images.
Hi po, hi.
What are you eating? Oh, fried chicken.
Good, good.
Yeah, the fried chicken vendor there, good.
Yeah, this looks a bit more rough
than what I was looking at on Google Maps.
But I still remain hopeful that there is a night market
and it's good, guys.
Hello.
- Hi, how are you?
Okay.
So this guy said it was up here and around.
Where's the night market? Night market?
- Night market!
Oh, this way?
- Over there.
Over there?
- Over there.
Keep going this way, this way?
- Oh, this way, yeah.
Okay, thank you po. Thank you.
No I will walk, it's okay. Thank you po. Thank you.
Thank you.
- You're welcome.
Okay.
Can't be that far away. This is the Carbon market area.
She says it's up this way.
That's good. Like two people have confirmed that
a night market does exist, so
that is positive, guys.
That is positive.
Okay, so I've reached the end of this road.
This is nice. This blue building here, USJR.
Think it might be a university area or something.
Hi, how are you?
Do you know where the night market is?
Night market?
- Night market.
Carbon. Carbon night market.
Ah, Carbon.
Carbon.
Over there.
Over there? Oh, they sent me this way.
Have you been before?
But I think night market only at Colon.
At Colon?
- Yeah.
No, there's no night market at Colon anymore.
- Oh, really?
Yeah, I went. There's nothing.
But there's some new one at Carbon.
Apparently.
But probably over there because that's new.
- All the new stuff is there?
Okay, thank you so much. Thank you.
- You're welcome.
Okay.
Probably students from that university.
I think it's a university,
right there.
But, yeah, this looks more new, guys.
There are some stalls here.
Is this it?
Is this actually it?
Guys, I see some...
Yeah, there are some stalls and stuff over there.
Let's go and check that out over there.
Hey, sir.
- Hi.
Yeah, guys, I think this must be it.
I think this must be it in here.
There's like a bunch of tables.
And this is all much nicer than
what I was seeing out on the streets.
And there is food, so I guess this is it.
This is it.
This is the Carbon night market, right here, guys.
Right here.
Okay.
Let's see if we can find Lechon.
That's what I'm up for.
Hi, hi.
Looking for lechon, lechon.

Oh, here? Oh my god, look.

Oh, there's another one here.
There's two and this is them both here.
Both closed.
- Both closed?
Ah, you're killing me.
You're killing me.
Ah, yeah.
Ah.
How can they both be closed?
How can the two lechon places be closed?
Oh my word.
There's someone here, grilling up...
Oh, that looks pretty good, actually.
Grilling up some marinated chicken, meatball, fish.
It's a
little barbecue station here.
Looks good.
Yeah, it's a whole section of barbecued meat,
right here.
Looks good, but it's not lechon, is it?
It's not lechon.
Darn it. Darn it.
Yeah, so all sorts of grilled meat.
Oh, sisig right there.
- Yeah, the sisig.
That looks beautiful.
That looks glorious.
- Yeah.
Ah, okay. So sisig is chopped pork and
chicken liver, right?
- Yes.
Yeah, that looks good.
I think I'm gonna go for this sisig.
Oh, that's how they serve it.
They serve it with silog. Yeah.
Okay, sisig silog.
Okay.
Can I get one portion, please, of the sisig silog?
Yes. Look at this, guys. Check it out.
Wow.
One serve?
Yes, one portion, please, with the egg as well.
I came for lechon, but they're closed.
They're not open today, lechon.
- Ah, lechon late?
Yeah, this one over here.
They're not open.
Normally they are open or what?
They're coming later or?
Yeah, she said, see the camera.

Yeah, beautiful, beautiful Filipina.
Beautiful silog.
Beautiful sisig.
Beautiful Filipina.
Everything beautiful at this market.

Okay, so it's like $1.80. It's good.
Okay.

Nice and cold as well.
That's just what I want.
Okay.
And I need the fork.

Okay.

And I think this is the...
I had this before. What is this one?
Palabok.
Palabok.
- Palabok.
Oh yeah, I think I've had this before, yeah.
It's noodles, right? Rice noodles.
Yeah, I've had this one before.
So it's 15 for this.
- You want this?
Oh, no, no, no.
I'm just gonna eat the silog first.
Okay, I'm gonna take the silog, the Royal,
and I'm taking the girl with me as well.
Okay.
- She's coming with me. Okay, let's go.
She's coming with me.
Okay.
Oh, what? It went in there?
Oh my God.
Did it go in there?
- Yeah.
Oh my word. Okay.
Okay, sorry about that.
Okay, they're gonna fish it out.
They're gonna fish it out.
Okay, thank you.
I'll take my silog and Royal.
Okay, let me get my...
You're going to help me.
Oh, okay, thank you. She put it in my arm.
Okay, thank you. Okay, I think I've just wasted.
Well, it was her that dropped it, not me this time.
Usually I'm dropping stuff,
but I think they've just wasted a whole,
whole tub of whatever that stuff was.
Yeah, maybe partly...
Oh, I nearly got...
Sorry.
Dog nearly tripped me up.
Yeah, it's...
I guess partially my fault for distracting her.
I dunno.
I'm gonna...
There's music playing away down there.
I'm gonna just sit here. Or stand here.
Hi, vlog.
- Hi, how are you?
Hi, how are you vlog?
Yes, she said how are you vlog?
Ask them, ask them. How are you? How are you?
What is your name?
Tal.
- Tal.
Hey, Tal.
Shout out to Tal. Shout out to Tal.
Okay.
- Shout out.
They really want to be in the vlog, guys,
so I put them in the vlog.
Okay, this sisig, it's gonna be interesting
how this compares to the sisig I had
when I first came to the Philippines,
I had sisig in Manila, and it was very expensive.
It was like sisig, a mango shake,
and rice, I think, was like almost a 1,000 pesos.
So this is 100 pesos, and it comes with egg.
It comes with silog.
If you see the sign "silog" anywhere,
it means you're getting it with rice and egg.
And there was already a spoon inside it,
but I'm gonna eat it with two spoons, guys.
Okay, just the sisig on its own, just the sisig on its own, to get a taste of it.
Oh, yeah.
On this one, the spices are less strong
than the restaurant I ate it at before,
but it is still spicy.
It's like a peppery, spicy, fatty, fatty bacon.
It's like eating thick, thick bacon.
Oh, balut, balut.
It's balut?
Okay, try, try. Reaction, reaction.
I should tell him, "show me, show me how to eat."
Show me how to eat.
- Okay.
That's good because nobody showed me.
The first time I ate balut, nobody showed me how to do it.
I made a mess.
I was peeling little bits of the shell.
This boy is gonna show me how to do it.
Oh, so you get a stick?
You get a stick and you stab it?
Is that how you do it?
You have to sip it.
It's hot? It's hot?
- It's hot.
You try.
- No, no, no, he...
It's very hot.
- I will watch him and learn.
I will learn from him how to do it.
It's too hot, yeah.
Yeah, they boil them so
they're very hot when they come out.
Okay, he's struggling. He's trying to peel the shell a bit.
He's trying to let it cool down a bit first.
I'm gonna continue eating my silog.
Yeah, he's just kinda slurping on
the soup. Is that what you call it?
The liquid inside the balut? It's like a soup.
Kind of just slurp, slurping on that.
Yeah. He's drinking it.
He's drinking the balut right now.
Sisig is delicious.
So he slurps a bit, he bites a bit, then he peels a bit.
And he's just, like, working it down like that.
Yeah, it's a messy thing to eat.
I don't think you can eat this without getting in a mess.
Yeah, like that. Oh, and there's
the duck embryo, right there.
Show.
- Show us. Show us.
Oh, there it is. Oh! He just ate it.
Good job, good job, good job.
- Good, good, good?
Yeah, he says it's good, yeah.
He just picked it up and put the whole
duck embryo in his mouth, and ate it.
So now all he's got left is the yolk, the yellow stuff.
Just the yellow and the white.
- Yeah.
And this sisig, it gets hotter the
more I eat it. It gets spicier.
I think I'm starting to eat some of the red chilies
that are in it, that's why.
See you.
- Okay, nice to see you.
Thank you for teaching me.
Thank you for teaching me, balut.
Okay, thank you. That was nice.
I learned.
I learned about how to eat it,
making less of a mess than what I did earlier.
Guys.
But this sisig, washed down with a Filipina, Filipino Fanta.
It's basically a Fanta. They call it
Royal for some reason. I don't know why.
It's very good. It's very, very good.
And I'm not much of a rice person.
When I eat rice, it makes me feel full,
and I don't want to eat much more, so
I end up wasting rice.
Sorry, guys.
Sorry.
Lovely jublee.
Let's go and see.
It was very nice. Very nice. Oh.
Thank you.
- Very, very, very tasty.
Thank you for the sisig.
I'm gonna go and see if the
lechon man has turned up or not.
I doubt it. Lechon takes a long time to prepare, guys.
Oh, he is there. He is there.
Maybe he cooks the pig at home or what?
This is him right here.
Dennis?
Dennis?
Yes.
- Dennis lechon.
Where's lechon?
Dennis is here but lechon is not here.
It's coming.
- It's coming, ah?
It's already cooked?
- Yes, yes, yes.
What time is it coming?
Ah, ah, 15 minutes.
15 minutes? Okay, I will wait. I will wait.
I want to be the first one.
Can I be the first one?
- Yes, sure.
Okay, I'll be the first one. That's good.
I thought I wasn't gonna get the lechon.
I'm ready to go somewhere else,
because I think he wasn't coming.
And you also have a neighbor who
does lechon but he is not here.
This one. Only you? Only Dennis today.
Only Dennis?
Okay.
Hi, po. How are you?
Okay, good.
Oh, here it is right here, the lechon. Cooked lechon.
It takes three of them. Three people. It's so heavy.
Big, big, big. Look at the size of it.
Look at the size of this here.
So they must cook it somewhere else.
Wow.
Good.
You want to be in the vlog?
This kid wants to be in the vlog.
I think he also wants lechon. You want lechon, right?
Yeah, I think he wants lechon.
I don't know who he is. I don't
know if he belongs to them or what.
He's just kind of like hanging around.
Just hanging around.
He kept saying to me, eat lechon, eat lechon.
I don't know if he's asking
me if I'm gonna eat it or if he...
Or if he wants some.
Eat lechon?
You, you eat lechon?
- My friend, my friend.
Your friend? Okay. Not just him, his friend as well.
Here we go.
Fresh, fresh lechon, right here.
Look at that. Look how crispy.
Wow, look, look.

Eat? Okay, three.
And me is four. Okay.
I will tell Dennis.
I need four portions.
Yes four portions.
But maybe small portions for the kids,
three for the kids and one for me.
So maybe small portions for them.
Yes.
Wow.
You have restaurant or only in the market?
No, we have restaurant every Sunday.
Every Sunday?
- Yeah.
Okay.
- Here every day.
But here is every day?
- Yeah.
Ah, okay. And it's Dennis Lechon. You can
find on Google Maps, I guess, his main shop.
But you have a main place where you're cooking?
Yes.
- Not here. You're not cooking here. Okay.
What your name?
- My name is Dale. What is your name?
John.
- John?
Hi, John.
What is your name?
- LeBron.
Huh?
- LeBron.
LeBron? Like LeBron James?
He said his name is LeBron. I don't think so.
I think he's like a basketball fan.
Yeah, bro. I want four portions, like one

Wow.

Oh, Dale Phillip?
- Yes. You know?
Yes.
- You know? Okay.
Thank you, thank you, very much.
- Okay. No problem.
Who do I pay? The lady or the man?
- Later, later.
Yeah, oh later, yeah. Usually the lady
is the boss for the money at these places.
I find that.
Usually the man is doing the work, the man is doing the cooking, and the lady takes the money.
That's normally how it works, guys.
Lechon is coming. Lechon is coming. Good.
Okay.
You're next. After this.
Oh, you said I was gonna be first.
- Yeah.
I thought I was gonna be the
first one. This guy's first.
Well done. The Golden State Warrior.
Yeah.
I think this is my one here.
And I bet they, look people
are starting to crowd around already.
I bet they finish this pig in like an hour or something.
They probably have to...
Dennis.
Every day one pig or more?
Every day one.
- Every day one, and when you finish, then you go?
Yes.
- Like that? Like one hour, two hours, three hours?
I think 9 pm.

Yes.

Oh, your daughter but she's not here?

Ah, okay. Good.
Okay, this crispy skin.
Crispy skin right here. I've already tried it.
It's already... I already know it's delicious, guys.
I already know it's delicious.
So incredibly crispy,
and fatty and delicious, guys.
Now the meat.
The meat. Oh.
It feels all soft.
It's all warm because it's freshly cooked.
Hi, guys.
Oh.
Oh, wow.
Oh, wow.
That's the most tender pork I've ever eaten.
It's so,
so soft, guys.
So soft. Wow.
Guys, there's more skin and fat than
there is meat. I've got the combo together.
Fat, skin and meat together and
I'm so thankful.
I'm so thankful I'm wearing the gloves.
This is a good thing.
Oh, wow.
- Crispy.
This fat, the fat is so delicious.
Oh, no, I don't need the sauce. Yeah.
Maybe I should take some of the rice.

Okay, join us, join us.

There's room I think for mother and daughter.
Okay, so I've just opened up this rice packet as well.
It's all kind of clumped together.
Yeah.
It's rice. It's rice.
And this is skin and fat, right here.
I would say there's twice as much, twice
as much skin and fat as there is meat on this.
But it's good. It's not healthy.
It's not healthy guys but it's tasty.
- Bye bye.
Bye bye. See you.
Okay.
I thought she was joining us but I think she's...
I don't know. It's so loud here guys.
They're playing loud music.
So hot as well.
We're in a bit with no ceiling fans and...
Hello guys.
Good?
Okay they're helping me. They're helping me vlog.
Giving me two free hands to
drink some water and eat more of this.
The fatty bits. The fatty bits. It's just pure flavour.
Yum, yum. Good.

- Good, good, yes.
Yes.

Good.
Bye, bye.
Okay.
He's leaving now.
Good huh?
Taking with you? Okay that's good.
They don't waste food here in the Philippines, guys.
Any leftovers they just take it with them.
It's good.
Thank you
for your company. It was very nice.
Bye, bye. Bye, bye.
Bye, bye. See you.
Bye, bye.
Go and pay for this now.
How much, Dennis?
560.
Okay. Thank you Dennis. Thank you.
Okay see you guys. Bye, bye.
Okay.
That was lovely,
so it was, guys.
I'm gonna get out of here cause the...
Hang on. We'll get out of here.
Okay guys. I'm back out onto the streets.
Here in Carbon.
This huge market area that's mostly for produce.
Even now, it's almost 6 pm,
it's almost dusk.
there's still people selling fresh fruits and vegetables,
guys.
I had to leave the food market, the night market,
because it was too loud. The music was too loud.
They just turned the volume up to maximum.
And then I was having to scream at the camera to be heard.
And the obvious copyright issues that can
really mess up your video, mess up your channel.
If you get some copyright match with
the commercial music that they were playing.
It was all like commercial music.
And I was already sitting as
far away from the speakers as I could.
The speakers were at the front of
the market and I was right at the back.
And yeah, it was just obnoxiously loud.
And there's no way to avoid it really so,
the only way to avoid it is to...
Actually more music here.
Well I can avoid it here by running
away from it and almost getting run over.
That's what I normally do when I'm out and about.
But there... Hi.
But, yeah, in there there was no getting away from it.
So I'm getting away from it now, guys.
And I'm actually headed towards the San Pedro Fort.
It's actually next to the port where I came in.
I came into this port around here,
when I came from Bohol to Cebu.
And there's the San Pedro Fort set up by
Miguel López de Legazpi
when he came here all those years ago.
And there's a big statue of him there.
And that's kind of where I wanted to end my vlog.
But it seems it's closed already.
So, yeah, I can't do that.
I'm gonna see if I can see the statue from the outside,
or anything like that.
But, yeah guys, I'm not making this a three day vlog.
I'm not coming back again
tomorrow just to see Mr. Legazpi
His statue.
I've done everything else I wanted to do
on this trip to the Philippines.
I ate all the foods I wanted to try.
I tried the sisig twice in fact.
Oh, and that's something you should try twice.
Or three times or four times.
That is, I would say that's, I would say the lechon.
The lechon was delicious.
And the sisig, they were my two favourites.
The pork, the fatty pork belly basically.
With the sisig.
I think I got more of the rump of the pig with the lechon.
You know, he was chopping up the bottom of the pig first.
So I don't think I got the belly.
The like the bacon-y part.
But it was so fatty, the butt.
I think it was the pig's butt that I ate.
A fatty pig's butt.
It was, yeah, like mostly fat and skin.
But delicious,
guys. Yeah I'm looking for this San Pedro Fort,
San Pedro Fort to finish off this vlog.
Because, like I said, I've done everything.
What is that thing there?
Let's see if we can see that from the front.
Ah, yeah, guys it's a statue of that black Jesus,
that was in that church that I visited in the last vlog,
but I didn't see this.
I didn't even know that that was there.
Yeah, it's like a boy, a boy Jesus that's black
and it was found washed up.
This isn't it. This is like a big massive version of it
that's been created as a statue.
But in Basilica de San Nino,
It was there. I think that was the part
where people were queuing up.
There was a part where people were
queuing up to get into a chapel.
I think that was it. They were queuing up to pray to that.
But I didn't see that.
I didn't see that when I was there, unfortunately.
But there's the bigger version, right there.
And according to Google Maps,
which I have just consulted,
this San Pedro Fort is just round this corner here. So,
I'm trying to make my way there quickly.
I don't think this kinda port area is somewhere you want to be wandering around
after dark.
And it is basically, like, a few minutes
until it is gonna be proper dark, guys. So,
I'm making my way down there.
This is a wee pedestrian area here.
So we've got all the skater boys.
Hi, bro.
The skater boys.
Hi, hi, hi.
The skater boys here.
We've got the bicyclists.
I'm looking for Legazpi.
Hi, hi.
I'm looking for Legazpi. Where is he?
He should have a statue around here somewhere.
Here we go.
This is the fort here.
The fort walls of Fort San Pedro.
Set up
in the Spanish colonial days.
The Spanish were here in Cebu about five years
before they conquered Manila. So this is the first,
this is actually the first
place in the Philippines they settled.
The first place.
The first fort, I'm guessing.
Probably where they sailed into, right there.
Probably where I sailed into from Bohol.
That's where they also sailed into. And the gates are closed.
And I think the statue is over the walls, guys.
I think, uh...
I think Legazpi statue is over the walls.
So, yeah.
It's nice though. Look at how they've lit it up at night.
Right here.
Fort San Pedro.
It's very nice. This is probably the staff on their way home.
And, I dunno, could I just ask somebody to just quickly
let me see Miguel López de Legazpi statue?
Oh, this opens?
Closed.
- Oh, a closed wedding. Sorry.
It's a wedding or something. Yeah.
Darn it. Darn it.
Darn it.
Because on Google Maps, the statue is right at that corner.
Oh, that's him!
That's, he's on the outside. He's on the outside.
We're gonna go and see him, guys. That's him right there.
That's Legazpi.
Okay.
Finally, something worked out well.
Things are working out well after yesterday,
turning up to a night market that didn't exist. Today,
turning up for Lechon and it wasn't there.
Then the lechon turned up.
I got three nice friends to eat it with.
I got my football top this morning and Legazpi is there.
Sometimes things work out, sometimes they don't.
That's the adventure of life, guys.
That is the adventure of life.
But, yeah. Let's go and see.
Ah, so he's behind the fence, but you can see him from here.
Hi, how are you? No, it's okay.
No, it's okay.
Fresh water.
- Not just now.
Yeah.
That is him right there.
That's good.
So, luckily I didn't...
What is this?
It's a trap.
A trap?
Thank you.
Okay. I think they're playing volleyball or something.
What's this for?
No, it's just a fence.
Oh, it's a fence? Ah, okay.
It wasn't very effective because I just went under it.
I came to see Legazpi. This Legazpi?
- Yeah.
Yeah, see where he is right here?
Miguel López de Legazpi, his statue right here.
The Spanish conquistador, who came here
and he brought Christianity, he brought Spanish culture.
She just tapped me on the shoulder and ran away.
Hi. Oh, it was this one?
Why? Why you tap me on the shoulder?
Why? Okay.
Yeah, he came here.
Basically a lot of the
Philippines culture that exists right now
would be totally different
if it wasn't for this man right here
who came here and conquered.
He took over from the Muslim
rulers at the time who were here.
But that is it. That's my adventure here in the Philippines, guys.
I hope you enjoyed it.
The next adventure will be from somewhere else
and I will see you then.
What?
They touch you.
- They keep... Yeah, why are they touching me?
I don't know.
- Oh, another one.
Stop it. You're cheeky. You're cheeky.
You're very cheeky.
Okay, bye-bye guys.
Bye-bye. Bye-bye.
