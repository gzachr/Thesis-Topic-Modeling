My friends that means good evening and how are 
you all doing I am doing well on this amazing  
night and what I'm up to today guys is I'm heading 
over to a place in Manila that is actually open  
still it's about uh like 8:15 and I was able 
to find one barber shop that was open till  
nine that was highly rated and it is about like 
17 minutes walking but at the speed I'm walking  
probably like 13 minutes away from my hotel in 
Binondo so I'm passing over [__]
All right we got [__] space right here and 
yeah guys we're walking over there I don't have an 
appointment or anything didn't call them but  
we're gonna see if they uh will give us a haircut 
and if they do they'll definitely get a nice tip  
for doing it because it's late at night as you 
can see the Beard's a little overgrown the hair  
is overgrown and we're in need of a nice clean up 
here so we are walking past the uh big mall right  
here like going into the Chinatown Museum 
area and it's kind of near the divisorium  
market that we're heading so right down this way 
we're about 12 minutes out we got Habib down the  
FaceTime she's actually watching this Vlog for a 
minute and uh we're about 11 minutes away killing  
two birds of one stone right now and once we get 
over there hopefully it'll be a fresh cut [__]  
let's go all right we're crossing over the 
street and oh we made it almost died there  
and here we go salamat kuya thank you all right 
and we made it across whoa that was a close one  
all right guys we're making a 
good progress here we've got a few  
maybe three or four blocks to go I want to say 
maybe 10 minutes walking so we're walking real  
quick through the neighborhood so we might 
be able to actually do it in like six minutes  
all right we've got to be getting close to 
it it's somewhere around here I believe if  
it's open I really hope Google Maps is correct 
because we're about to find out we shall see

no wonder why they both let us in because we both  
arrived after they closed we're gonna do the 
haircut today guys we're gonna do the beer trim  
we're gonna be looking like a fresh new man after 
this I'm gonna be looking Filipino after this oh  
perfect Salama as you can see we it's like we're 
back in the US we've got the American flag Barber  
color uh covering right here yeah that's pretty 
fresh this is the longest I've grown the hair out  
up top it's probably uh yeah quite a bit uh maybe 
three times my last three haircuts I didn't even  
trim the top so skin Fade's gonna look fresh there 
clean it up and uh it's gonna be a big change  
let's put it that way it's nice nice place and 
you're from Manila I'm from Milano are you finally  
there now oh another city yeah yeah that's close 
to Manila also uh part of the Philippines yeah so  
how many years have you lived in Manila four years 
four years all right and you like it what you like
it's very good yeah it's a 
very busy uh and uh very uh  
high traffic yeah but a lot of fun vibrant City
foreign
that haircut was from Lebanon that photo 
was from Lebanon this big fan okay I know  
a couple words yeah yeah that means 
handsome yeah hahaha I know that one  
I I've got a small list of words here yeah 
yeah I know magandang Gabi I know McDonald's
[____]
I know how to negotiate in the market
that's good Tagalog yeah there's a lot 
of similar words to Spanish because we've  
been invaded basically yeah I saw that in the 
history and I speak a little bit of Spanish I'm  
not fluent but I know a few words so I recognize 
a couple similarities here and there you speak  
a different dialogue in the city you're from yeah 
that same Tagalog or different language different  
language yeah there's so many languages 
oh yeah but my vacation's been really nice  
I've only explored a Manila I've explored like 
the banondo area and also I went to Tage City
it's a big volcano yeah I think for the top just a 
small little like trim off that much under attack  
yeah and how many years have you worked at Supremo 
from the beginning from the beginning 15 years
oh wow so you started it Manila
thank you thank you since you since you arrived 
to Manila yeah okay very nice how much does a  
person a price of a haircut in America varies 
significantly it depends where where you are  
so because you know United States is very big 
so if you're in New York City yeah and you go  
to a luxury Barber maybe 70-80 dollars for like 
uh 70 or 80 dollars for a haircut and a beard  
if you go to like uh a barber in a small town 
maybe twenty dollars so in in you want to  
know in Filipino pesos and Filipino pesos in 
New York would be 4,000 pesos and in in like  
a small city in the United States it would be 
um one thousand one thousand one hundred pesos
my haircuts are better when 
they are not in America
I mean I've never gotten a haircut that's  
as good as the ones that I've gotten 
internationally in America all right
we can see the haircut starting to take 
shape there yeah it's fixing the shape  
of my head quite a bit and it looks nice and 
guys I'll tell you every time I get a haircut  
around the world it's always interesting 
to see each Barber's unique way of doing  
things some start on the top some start 
on the sides some start you know uh with  
the lowest level blade guards some start with 
the highest and build the fade from there so  
it's always unique to see each uh each person's 
special way of perfecting a fade haircut
get close to that skin right there that looks nice
watching YouTube channel that's  
what's up they find the world know 
that right there kuya thank you
so is the local language you speak in your city 
it's much much different than Tagalog foreign
ERS that speak good Tagalog no no
there's some a couple words yeah
last month I had customers 
he's from Germany from Germany
they speak Singlish yeah yeah oh that's 
good so do you get a lot of foreigners  
here or just sometimes just sometimes okay 
well guys that means you gotta come here  
and get yourself a fresh cut over at Supremo 
Barber especially because they're open later  
than like 95 percent of the other barbers in 
the bonando area that's how I ended up here  
and actually they're taking care of us it's 
already 9 17 so an hour and 17 minutes past  
most Barbers and about 17 minutes past 
that closing time all right the best part
IES
everything's more fun in the Philippines right
in boycott is what yeah yeah meeting my brother 
over there he's actually in in Boracay uh tomorrow
there's what cheeks uh chicks I 
don't think my fiance would like that
yeah that Fade's looking very fresh brother
so now we've got the Clippers out here we're 
gonna actually uh connect that fade on the side  
with a longer hair up top and Korea's already got 
that going and it's faded in quite nicely there  
amazing how different you look when your 
head's been shaped properly from a fade  
that looks nice the Precision our men's put 
on this is uh showing now in the results
so what's the most popular haircut in 
the Philippines the style these days
I'm doing a fade yeah yeah so after 
I get this haircut I'll look Filipino
um
so those are the thinning scissors 
yeah okay yeah my hair's pretty thick  
definitely needed it it's giving 
it a much better shape to it
oh nothing better than a fresh cut oh yeah a 
great job iOS brother we're getting some of  
these last little straggly hairs right 
on the side there a clean as it can be
uh it cleans up yeah let's try it out yeah 
let's try sure yeah do most people in the  
Philippines get that yeah yeah all right 
perfect if it's normal then I'll do it
what else
all right so that gives my head 
a new shape there oh that's nice
a little a little hair removal 
from the sides that it can do
oh wow that is clean well done
guys look at that it just 
gives a much like more defined
nice I like that a lot
oh yeah nice I'm glad we went with that and 
this is my friends is the final haircut that  
is so nice great length up top it just Fades 
right in there nice and thin now too so it'll  
be easier to style that up top and then we've 
got a really really clean fade all the way  
around the entire head as you can see all the 
super nice feeling when you touch that pain  
sing a special nice clean in there on the 
back too oh it's such a nice feeling it's  
like a light back scratching it's just 
taking off those little uh straggly hairs
oh yeah that's nice super smooth on the back now
it's but not least the uh beard here
