members of the barrio today we're going 
to be showing you some of the best  
asian fried chicken in new york city from 
filipino to korean and taiwanese hope you  
brought your appetites this is my go-to 
fast food spot in new york city not arby's
jollibee so it's going to be the three-piece 
chicken joy with one side one pineapple juice  
and one water that's my boy here jellybean this 
is how you know you've come to the right spot  
fried chicken this is what they're known for this 
is their signature actually have you ever had  
this before yeah i've had jollibee fried chicken 
before it's pretty good it's a lot different than  
like kentucky fried chicken put it that way in a 
good way in a good way okay i've been told that  
to do jollibee right you've gotta dip it in 
the gravy this piece is so big i can barely  
fit it in oh there we go there we go drumstick 
looks like honey dripping off incredible it does  
all right let's uh let's take our 
first bite of the day cheers cheers
if a bite is worth a thousand words you could 
hear how crunchy and crispy this jolly chicken is  
with the thigh covered in gravy the gravy 
just adds this nice extra salty flavor to it  
i mean it is good and it's funny you 
mentioned how the gravy was like honey  
it does taste like that like the consistency but 
it adds a little bit of saltiness afterwards and  
this chicken's like so moist i love it jollibee 
fried chicken can never go wrong absolutely not  
this is one of those places when i tell people 
to come to sometimes they get surprised or  
like fast food i'm like jollibee's not 
your average fast food i'm sorry right  
not talked about enough here is the pineapple 
juice at jollibee now it's about 40 degrees  
outside not exactly tropical weather but you know 
this is still it's putting me in a warm mood i  
guess this is warming up a little bit you know 
i was here the week it opened the line was down  
the block jollibee is such a cultural institution 
in the philippines and we just so happen to have  
an ambassador filming right now amazing ben 
get this used to work at jelly bean virginia  
what's the secret to the jollibee chicken this is 
just typical salt and pepper simple yeah i know  
is that they never actually they come 
in already marinated so in the stores we  
would just deep fry them apart from dunking 
it you can also just pour the gravy over
pretty much
it's time for some kfc and we're not 
talking colonel sanders here korean  
fried chicken is the hottest type of 
fried chicken in the city right now
could we do the small combo wings 
and drums with soy garlic that's it
all right i said i was only gonna have one piece 
max to conserve my appetite but after staring at  
this it's gonna be more than one just from the 
looks of it compared to jollibee i feel like  
jollibee is more of your american style fried 
chicken this is very korean i mean just look  
at this thing you see all the glaze on it 
it's just coming at you like eat me i agree  
it's saying eat me like i i don't want to waste 
much more time on this let's do it i know cheers
that was so good i needed two bites at once it's 
really crispy and the soy garlic flavor doesn't  
overpower you i was afraid that the sauce would be 
too strong but it's just like the perfect amount  
and the consistency of the chicken excellent 
so good i almost ate into the bone and now i  
ate my teeth but totally agree with john the 
soy garlic flavor doesn't overpower the chicken  
at all it's super crunchy so far i think this 
is the best asian fried chicken i've ever had  
in my life yeah i haven't had a lot i do not 
have a huge amount of experience with asian  
fried chicken with korean fried chicken but 
this is just jumping out of the page for me
now this is important research we're doing because 
my wife adriana loves korean fried chicken i don't  
think she's ever been here before so i'm doing 
really vital research for our relationship  
i know it's important to have good fried 
chicken if you want to stay together  
husband duties bringing adriana some what the heck
next stop is in the heart of koreatown which and 
by the way we did an amazing guide to koreatown  
if you want more ideas what to do here check 
it out down below this is honestly one of the  
best blocks in all of manhattan for eating 
and drinking i will tell you hey here we are
all right so this is more of a grab-and-go kind 
of place i admit there's a lot of choices here  
we got boneless with bone wow a lot of choices uh 
i'm thinking honey garlic it's like the 7-eleven  
of korean fried chicken right here this thing all 
right here we go big unveil oh that's a lot that's  
a lot honey garlic turn it into an asian fried 
chicken feed after this video no joke bon appetit
i like it but it doesn't have the same flavor 
explosion that bonchan did this honey is a lot  
more understated yeah i would say the same 
thing but definitely a lot more crunchy  
i'll give it that definitely lighter i feel like 
i can eat more of these really quickly or bunch on  
i just wanted to savor every single bite like for 
me this i could just go through this really fast  
yeah i mean like you said this is more like 
a casual restaurant you just grab and go and  
these you could usually just down them having a 
few drinks a lot of people don't know this but  
fried chicken got very big in south korea 
after the american gis were there and that's  
how it spread similar story to the philippines 
with jollibee and some other chains so we're  
actually looking at some american influence 
here just done a little bit different though  
they're not supposed to talk oh yeah 
then he's not real he's not he's not  
that's what they call it or is he i did that 
you know i actually did i did that when i  
was in london but i didn't mess with them but 
they really don't flinch they just chill yeah
tkk fried chicken we went from philippines 
to south korea now to taiwanese
i think we're going to get wings we want curry 
seasoned or lemon pepper your choice sorry
oh i smell the curry it's strong that's a 
really strong curry flavor here look at this  
it's not as glazy as the other ones but 
it looks seasoned very well i smelled it  
it has the strongest smell of all the chicken 
wings we've had so far today that's for sure  
he's not really that big the cheap 
fast food style cheers all right
definitely the spiciest of all the wings 
we've had so far today that yeah that  
crazy flavor smacks you in the face wow 
like with no sauce with nothing extra  
it's a little hot got me a little hot yeah
i'm dating the curry flavor though yeah i like 
it there's a lot of flavor here i love the curry  
definitely not like saying jollibee style which i 
think is more americanized like this is something  
distinctive i think it stands by itself i have 
to say of all the spots we went to today tkk  
surprised me the most i had pretty much 
on the lowest expectations of this one  
never been before really impressed though 
just like quick grab-and-go fast food pkk  
like really went high on my list for it tell

asian fried chicken places you most want
