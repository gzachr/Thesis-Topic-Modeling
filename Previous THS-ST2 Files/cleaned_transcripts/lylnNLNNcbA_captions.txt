hello everybody my name is katrinka i'm a
professional singer and a voice coach and
welcome back to my channel it's one of those
days where you have too much coffee and you
talk way too fast so if i'm gonna stumble
on my words i'm very sorry again too much
coffee it's a long day today we're gonna be
reacting to kz tendingen i hope i'm reading
her name correctly and yeah i've heard that
she's an absolute badass and you know that
i have a soft spot in my heart for badass
women bad ass singers so i cannot wait she's
gonna be singing rolling in the deep which
is overall a fantastic song by adele you definitely
know that song and i've heard her rendition
is just completely different so i cannot wait
if you would want me to react to your request
you can come to my live stream i do voice
coach react on monday and then on wednesdays
and fridays i do live concerts they take around
three hours live on my channel the link is
gonna be in my description so come hang out
it's gonna be a lot of fun and without any
further ado let's go
i love guitar and draws
[Applause]
okay she has a very heavy fx element hey come
on my girl [Applause]
very wild flavors i like here [Music] i like
it and you played it you played it [Music]
she made it a very um latino nice long tone
okay so i'm just really quickly saying one
thing she has a very heavy affect on i don't
know if she's gonna have it like a whole song
i am personally not directly like against
using effects on voice i think it can bring
a very interesting flavor into the song and
it can be very interesting a certain kind
of arrangements but it has to be done well
so it doesn't look out of the place and it
like suits into the music suits into the picture
they're trying to paint so and this effect
was very very heavy i'm not sure if she's
gonna continue with the effect we're gonna
see
okay so the effect is off now we're going
to continue without it
she's having that [Music] nice
they're using a lot of elements from latino
music too [Music] well you get the body movements
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
nice variations [Music]
they started with like a very funky music
i like it because it has a lot of latino elements
but it's still keeping that a little bit of
a rock and roll a little bit of a funk you
know so it has a lot of flavors and i'm really
really rolling with it she's changing the
song a lot i really like it let's continue
[Music]
oh
[Music] she's putting emphasis on the different
tones [Music]
[Applause] [Music] is [Music] [Applause]
how to
[Applause] [Music]
check this
[Music]
is
[Music]
beautiful that was good that was good
like genuinely usually when singers try to
rap 90 percent of singers i'm not i'm not
saying that all of them but 90 person singers
fall weak and they just like their rap game
is never up to par to their singing but her
rap verse or everything that she did over
there was absolutely amazing like she's a
great rapper too like the rhyming and everything
and the speed really good i love that and
it was actually not falling behind the singing
[Music]
whatsoever
she's having fun huh
[Music]
[Applause] she divided it
oh that's a power stance [Music] [Applause]
she's such a show man [Music] two women [Music]
[Applause] nice all right so before i'm gonna
dive to anything else i just wanted to um
pinpoint two things the first one is here
[Music]
and she's just cutting the edges of the of
the phrase she's rephrasing a little bit and
she's more punchy in a certain sense like
she's not dragging the nose but she's like
so she's putting emphasis on a higher note
and then dragging a little bit down that was
very interesting element i liked how she changed
it up and the second one [Music]
i think i said multiple times in my previous
videos that e is one of the most difficult
sounds to drag so like e force you to uh put
up your smile and kind of clench your whole
throat which when you have this high notes
you want to open everything relax your throat
and she decided to switch it she wasn't dragging
a phrase uh rolling in the d
but she made it rolling in the deep hey so
she took her opportunity to not drag the e
but she chose an open phrase like yeah oh
it was a really smart choice she did something
that is really interesting she grabbed effects
that would normally be done in pulse process
and in the recording studio during the mastering
of the of the track and she did it live on
stage it was such a ride this was this was
a fantastic rendition of the rolling in the
deep it was still a pain and homage to adele
of course because adele is absolutely amazing
class a singer but this little badass completely
renditioned the whole song and she added her
own flavor it was absolutely amazing i loved
her so much in jazz and blues a lot of times
uh singers but also uh instrumentalists use
something that is called improvisation and
she was definitely working without tons of
improvisation on this song especially vocal
improvisation and me as a huge fan of kind
of taking inspiration from other genres putting
them in your genre and fusing them together
and taking the best of that of that of that
of that and creating something unique i'm
a huge fan of that so yeah now i really want
to check her music like i really want to know
if she does her own music and how that looks
like an issue too every single time i upload
