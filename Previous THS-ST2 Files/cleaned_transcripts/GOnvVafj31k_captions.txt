It was very late last night, I was very tired, so I fell asleep as soon as I arrived.
Just got out of the house, I was very hungry, so thought I should eat something
I have an apartment in this tower
I am trying to book Grab for a long time but booking is not happening
I'll catch a taxi from here to see if it stops here
There are lots of jeepney here, I want to try that also
I'm going to a mall right now, a friend of mine is going to meet me
I just arrived at AyaLa Mall
My friend has said come to this mall
I couldn't get a grab, so I came here with a taxi
It was showing me 188 pesos in the grab but I only gave 100 pesos in the taxi
local taxi cost me cheaper than Grab
It's a big mall, now I have to find where is my friend
Feeling hungry too thought let's have lunch together
I'll look for her now
I am here for this annual festival "Sinulog"
i don't know much about it
Finally I have found my friend and now we are sitting in a restaurant and we have just ordered lunch
little shy and has said that she doesn't want to be on camera
but i still introduce
this is my friend Avon
Avon told me that I have to learn few words before coming to the Philippines
She does not live in the Philippines, here she has come to meet her family
I called her and asked if free then come to meet and now we are having lunch here
I don't know much about this festival, obviously she knows more, I was just joking
Sinulog is the ritual prayer-dance honoring the Child Jesus
I am very excited about this festival
The food we have ordered right now is rice with chicken for me and seafood with pork for her
I requested her that if she gets the time, then give me a little philippines tour or Cebu atleast
She speaks Bisaya in Cebu, otherwise People speak Tagalog in Manila
It is very hot in Cebu, today I had no interest in going out, I will have lunch here, I will roam around a little, after that home
I don't eat pork, so I'll just eat chicken and fried Rice
And here's this local beer
The quantity of food in the restaurants here is very high.
While roaming here, the impression of this festival is seen everywhere
this festival is on Sunday actually
People doing practice for Sunday's carnival
My friend has said that on the day of carnival everyone dances in the street, people eat and drink and enjoy a lot all day
And everywhere, someone keeps practicing
It's time for dinner now, people eat dinner very early here
I came here in a normal restaurant and maybe I will have some item of chicken
I will probably take noodles but here it is written shawarma with rice
Came to buy stuff for house
Buying goods from Philippines is more expensive than India
here i bought some eggs, its price is 144 pesos
Means 155 indian Rs.
Eggs 144 Pesos
One Bell Pepper 89 pesos
Not even 6 bananas 100 pesos
In India price is almost 1/3 of Phillipinnes
Its Little Expensive Country
In India 6 bananas cost only 40 Rs.
and here its 100 pesos means 140 Rs in India
I have taken all this stuff from the super market, if the same thing was from the local shop, then the rate would have been more expensive
Its not a Cheap Country
Price is quite expensive here
Here I met a Sardarji
He also came here to buy his stuff
What is your name
Bipinder and he is from Delhi 
Bipinder works here but before that he was in Gurgaon
While working in Gurgaon, he got a little bored, so he came here in the Philippines and started working
So how do you think Philippines is, is it cheaper than India?
How do you feel living in the Philippines, here the cultural difference, living, drinking, everything is different
But being a Punjabi who are hardcore non-vegetarian, you're still limited to chicken only , or move up even further
It feels so good when you are roaming somewhere and all look alike and then find a unique look
And know it's Indian
It was nice meeting you
