[UcieczkaDoRaju presents...
I bought a wife on slums...]
[Two weeks later...]
This is a tribal nuptial ritual led by
the spiritual leader of
the Badjao tribe...
Our feet were touching, and
I had to hold the scarf in my hand
the whole time, and so did he...
That white stuff is rice.
Today is the wedding of this
foreigner with a Badjao girl.
This marriage will grow
like a big crop of rice
and will be full of happiness
like this cup full of water.
Leader: You have to drink.
Damian: Everything?
Yes... Not all, just half...
The other half must be drunk by Aico...
[One hour later...]
The music turned off from time
to time because the equipment
was quite old and
makeshift for the ceremony.
[One week earlier...]
Damian: We're at home of make up artist,
who will do make up for Aico.
Damian: I turned off the light,
see how it's with light.
Damian: I just turned off to record
without, but I'll show you how it is with.
Damian: Generally Filipinas look
much better without makeup
than with makeup so we will
see how it will be in this case.
Damian: I suspect the same.
That's how Aico looks without makeup...
Damian: Check out what
supplements they have here.
Damian: I asked what it was and
they said it was body supplements.
Damian: And they pour
water over it and drink it.
Damian: Such as sticks
which I suspect have properties
according to them...
Maybe they have - who knows...
Damian: And the altar must also be
of our magnificent...
Damian: We are going to
this boat to take photos.
Damian: A while ago we took
pictures here on the bridge,
where some guys observe us.
Damian: Now we go here, all at ease.
Damian: This is a man
who manage all this...
Damian: I can hardly
believe I'm getting married.
Damian: I feel like I'm in
some fairy tale or movie.
Damian: They're pulling...
Damian: On the background of
the American flag - It must be.
[All photos made by makeup artist?]
Damian: Now there will be a
moment of handing over
the money and we are
waiting for witnesses.
Soon there will be witnesses and
we will hand over the money.
A strange feeling,
but it's such a tradition.
Damian: The lady said it's ok.
[All the houses in this
village stand on stilts.]
[Here people sleep,
you can call it a room.]
Damian: It's the second
day of preparation and
and again makeup because
there will be another session
in the wedding dress.
Damian: We are a while
after giving the money.
Damian: And we're about to
go to a session.
Damian: Check out the
construction of this house.
Damian: How the cables are
hanging, here is the light bulb...
Damian: Everything is made makeshift
from many found materials.
Damian: There is not even a window...
The window is there, but the glass is not.
Damian: But there is a sea view.
Damian: Now it is the final phase
of preparation for the photo shoot.
Damian: When it rains
the water comes into the house here.
Damian: Check out the fan hanging.
Damian: It's probably used at night.
Damian: During the day he wouldn't
be able to handle it, one is needed.
Damian: What you see by the wall
are kind of like
closets for clothes
I mean no closets, because
they are packed in different bags
and covered with fabric
to keep them out of the mess.
Damian: But it is something like a closet
where clothes are kept.
[At the same time, the floor below...]
A treat for all tribal members in
connection with the giving of money.
Check out what they made me wear.
I don't have my stuff because
they didn't tell me to bring it.
Now it's my third photo shoot and
I have a too-small t-shirt
and too-small pants
that are put on top of my other pants.
And Aico is dressed similarly.
We will be dressed in sportswear.
Damian: We are on the last session
and in the last session we
were dressed in the same outfits.
Damian: I will show you photos.
[However, these are the real
pearls that are sold to tourists...
Because of the pandemic,
they are lying in the sack...]
Damian: Practically all
their jewelry is fake,
but I don't know why
pearls are so popular.
[Three hours earlier...]
Aico is my cousin... I'am happy...
Damian: Ok...
One you have to drink with me.
Damian: Ok.
[Two hours before ceremony...]
[I practice a traditional tribal dance...
This Aico's brother, he learn me.]
Damian: I'm all wet, but it's pleasant.
Damian: Brownout - that
means there's no electricity.
Damian: We sit and wait for
the electricity to come back,
and because of this,
there is no light and the fans don't work.
Damian: So, we're waiting.
Damian: Aico brother-in-law
brought a light bulb
and will try to restore the light.
Damian: There is no
electricity all the time.
Damian: So he brought a battery.
(Inaudible)
(Inaudible)
Damian: Maybe they want to
show that there will be light.
I'll plug the light in for you Damian.
Damian, dress in wedding clothes.
[Start of the wedding ceremony...]
You have to pick me up with a chair
and turn me around my axis three times.
It was that moment when the music stopped
and Aico was ashamed of it...
[Gifts...]
[Half hour later...]
Congratulations...
Damian: Aico is packing
its things because...
Damian: I honestly don't know
what's going to happen if we're
going to go to my place right away
or if she's still going to stay
here, I think probably not.
Damian: That is, I'm
taking her to my place.
She's packing up
and can only leave home after the wedding.
Damian: Such an interesting fact.
The ceremony has just ended,
so I am a newlywed
bridegroom.
I am a newlywed bridegroom.
Let me tell you honestly
that I couldn't imagine
a better wedding.
There was a moment I was
going to cry, but I held back
because of the way
everything was going on...
That ceremony all with the gentleman
who was glowing with smoke....
[Smoke glowing :D ...
Ah, those emotions...]
It was just so magical for me.
I know that many people will think that
I am stupid and that
I am completely crazy.
I've seen different comments
about myself and Aico.
Such as that how very low I fell to
look for a girl in the slums
so I fell so low that I found
myself a wife in the slums, imagine that.
It was a tribal wedding
and not a civil, ecclesiastical
wedding, which has no
legal force,
just such a tribal ceremony here.
It was so magical and
touching for me that
I am very grateful and...
It's hard for me to say.
The gentleman with whom
I walked holding the scarf
and he conducted this ceremony...
It was something really magical,
I felt like I was in a dream.
I am very grateful, very happy and
a new chapter begins in my life.
And in "UcieczkaDoRaju" as well.
I hope you will accept me
and Aico as a couple,
as a married couple...
And I hope that this whole
ceremony and this place
will also show that cultural
differences can be overcome and
I also hope that our relationship
will prove this.
And it will be an example of the fact that
if from two completely different
worlds two people find
something that unites them, that is love,
they can overcome all
opposites of fate of which
there were some.
Ok, maybe it's enough now.
Damian: Check it out,
such an interesting fact.
Everyone has such a
protective cord...
Everyone has such a protective cord
on their body from birth.
Damian: Check it out, Aico has as well.
Damian: Such a curiosity that
this suitcase was bought
yesterday especially for the ceremony
and moving out of the house.
From the money they got,
everyone in the village
received a food
package - rice, cookies, soda...
What was there,
what we were sitting
next to as they took photos
is bread made from rice.
Quite hard, sweet,
in cosistence a little 
like wholemeal bread.
[Here you can see how
the pies were made.]
Damian: I'm shocked that it's made of 
rice, I thought it was made of flour.
But it actually has
that rice texture.
[Smoke glowing :D ...
Ah, those emotions...]
Where is Aico? 
- She went for her sandals...
[My wife's first day at home...]
Damian: Aico read the Bible to these
 children every Sunday at this our.
Damian: Today is the first 
Sunday and she is not there.
Damian: And they called 
her that they missed her.
With that cheery note, 
I want to end this vlog today.
All the best - "UcieczkaDoRaju."
We keep having fun.
