Ok I go I leave Manila
and there I towards the airport and I'm going straight to the airport. I have not filmed yesterday I will explain why
Here I am back at the airport. I just spend the night here in the city
because I'm just 24 hours of transition I had come to see a friend I had not seen for four years
marco it felt really good to see you, a super nice evening with you at the restaurant
Let me see a little bit how it goes manila night was very nice I saw the old city all that so I
'm really not linger long with four new
bad and good three
the bad is that my visa will not last 30 days, but a little less when I was a little disappointed yesterday I you
admit when I arrived in Manila so I'll spend a little less time but it's okay because
in the three first good news is that I'm super
excited and impatient
to achieve maximum blog here in the Philippines and that's what I'll do I think I will sort every day
anyway I will try
mounting and filming every day what I'll do here in the Philippines there are two other good news
the first is that I will
see someone who has a lot to me in any case when I make youtube it offers
Time for meeting with all subscribers Cebu so it falls well hyper I again ass edged noodles
the second thing is that the coup
the bad news that I had yesterday: spend a little less time
here in the Philippines. Will allow me to
ultimately to better organize my trip
I have to do many more things but it will allow me to spend more time in the islands and
my levels go diving and that is what I will do is really what I want to do
and so I think I'll dive especially with the sharks foxes who these sharks out with a huge tail that is really beautiful
also spend time underwater to see the whale sharks
mathilde and was released finally traveled together for three weeks in Thailand it was great we had fun in Thailand
it was great to have him with me but really if you see Matt and I know you'll see these pictures there was great
good to spend time with you
I think we will meet again later and thank you for all and for all that you brought me
I think we were a good duo on some things and it was really great to travel with you
Cebu steering a half hour flight that left for the islands it will be really great I can not wait to get to these lice
This one is the morning here in cebu city
I have nothing of my day yesterday apart
I started a little my videos
for the latest videos left to do in Thailand so I worked hard anyway I'm just wandering around
cebu city streets and I'm going to meet a youtuber makes up a myth called Finn snow I had already
met in Thailand in April we had met in the park Lumphini we launched our drones in the same place so it was pretty fun
we are not personally know but I'll see him because I really like this guy and I really appreciate also what makes her
Work is crazy on youtube besides, I suggest you go see what makes also before I go meet
this hostel is really well I slept in a room of 10 and I was all alone and I paid 8 euros man u
and so it's really worth what it is a trick that is too funny here
throughout the Philippines it is said
this is the kind of small bus which everywhere in the city
it really is a local thing I try to take one
But super super super handy
all fines subscribers appointment with gives him find the place is that it is already there I'm too happy with the
see this guy is a crazy thing that makes
it is a trick of relief that he did on video since she started all his journeys
And
Well, as I thought it's not bad
I knew he would not round up the world and all that is too funny to see that there are a lot of Filipinos who came
because finally I talked to one of them but she said you know these great videos on known
because Filipinos interested damn what foreigners think beyond the Philippines is illegal such videos
So that's a super good news for me is going super good time with subscribers all that I meet lots of people
it's really great owls are adorable
it's cool to find fine and that's even with a guy every thousand views that gathered all that it remains the same
I love this guy is really worrying
Finn and I were not really the same hardware, it's really bigger. We see the difference of stuff that he
all replays that makes that thing is this is a war machine that is who I am,
I finally found my Finn's been a while that we had not seen one continues a little talk always together. I watch
I watch all these videos just making it and really is an inspiration
It was really wonderful afternoon with him and then even with other people because ultimately
I talked a lot of Filipinos who advised me lots of things to do here in the Philippines this journey will end in a way but
memorable is absolutely certain they have so advised me to do things here
I still do not even know what I hope there are so many options
Finn was good advice I'm going back to the hotel
I will prepare myself for tomorrow tomorrow what the car really begins
Here it was a rather special blog where I talked a lot in the end eat not show much but it was just a step
he had to do in my videos showed the separation was between thailand and philippines
and now I'm lapped I leave for 21 days
ventured through the Philippine I think it will be really great and it'll explain that the amount
