good morning we have secured some breakfast 
the most ridiculous selection from 7-Eleven  
living that budget life I have got a plant-based 
chicken burger for breakfast which is so out of  
the norm for me but I've had this one before 
and it was so good and they normally don't  
have it and I got super excited so I'm having 
that for breakfast I've been basically living  
off these buns for the last week and they're really 
nice um show the bun yeah there you go review  
yeah they're cheap tasty hot perfect for a road 
trip and coffees Lucky Day strong and creamy  
coffee that sounds exactly like we like but 
before we get on the actual road today there is  
one place we've got to go pick up something 
very very important so we'll see you there
all right we'll see you in a second
so the thing that we really really needed to 
get was our passports with our extra month  
that we get to stay in the Philippines we 
haven't even used our first month yet but  
now we have another month you can actually 
extend it before your original Visa even  
runs out so yay road trip road trip we made a 
little bit of a mistake we parked up in what  
we thought was the parking lot of the shopping 
mall in which the immigration office is turns  
out that was not the parking for that shopping 
mall it was a parking for a supermarket which is  
members only which we are not members of but 
if you don't have a membership card it's 400  
pesos to pay for the parking so it's quite 
expensive parking but we got our visas yeah  
so let's just pretend that was part of the 
visa fee and then we feel better about it  
not the best start and now we're heading off to 
Tagaytay and it started raining yay
Let's hope we get some better weather when we get down there it looks like a 
really beautiful tourist place where maybe a lot  
of Filipinos go and I'm very excited to check it 
out they're not too keen on the rain but it's okay  
we're inside a car at least we're not driving 
on a motorbike let's get some petrol people
I wasn't really sure how much to put 
in you know so I just put in 1000 Pesos  
just brought me up to four bars but we 
can always top up again I think we'll  
be good to get to Tagaytay. one hour and 17 minutes to 
go nice it's not too far is it no okay. Roadtrip
I think we are just about 10 minutes out of Tagaytay 
just about 5-10 minutes ago all of the landscape  
kind of changed from being very built up to just 
Greenery all around there's palm trees everywhere  
so it's like jungle this side some smaller houses 
on this side it's very nice Manila is awesome but  
it's very busy and very built up so it's kind 
of nice to pop out for just a day or two and  
just have a little bit more of a relaxing Vibe 
for a moment we're a really high in elevation  
The views are insane oh my God I think our 
hotel has a balcony with that view oh wow  
I can't wait to see it properly 
I think we're three minutes away  
from our hotel oh excited yeah me too 
yeah oh this looks legit yes uh p214.
basement parking okay how do I how do we 
so around here exit okay I'll try okay  
okay thank you massive shotgun which is right by 
my head yeah we're trying to find B2214. yeah  
outside outside yeah then another Corner 
first Corner turn left bin okay thank you  
he laughed at our little Airbnb there's like 
photos with arrows and stuff to make it very  
obvious and very easy and I think we're just 
in the wrong place at least he didn't have  
a super intense shotgun he has he only got a 
pistol yeah so it's okay that means we're safe  
oh yes that looks like the picture that's it 
it says if with Car please proceed to second  
floor parking space until the guard parking 
number and there's a pink arrow that points  
up this ramp getting into airbnbs is always 
like a puzzle yeah follow this arrow and then  
do a few jumps and then hoot like an owl yeah 
hi B214 what is your room number I  
don't know we're just checking into our Airbnb 
today cool little lady let's just call this okay
hi um can I just ask what the 
room number is one five two  
eight okay perfect thank you very 
much thank you very much thank you
that's it I made it
let's check out the place then
all right let's go check in
oh it's so cute oh wow I'm definitely 
taking that chair that's mine  
oh it looks really lovely wow that's so nice. Nice view
to you whoa oh look at that yeah okay thank you 
very much yeah and tomorrow when we check out we  
text you okay perfect okay thank you so much bye 
bye have a nice day we've now calmly checked in  
and gotten a little bit settled we just want to 
show you this place a little bit less hectically  
it's really nicely laid out sort of open space 
living room kitchen dining area it's got a massive  
TV with a good solid sound bar so you've got some 
good audio on it there's a kitchen with all the  
utensils that you might want and the kettles 
and the rice cookers but we're actually eating  
out tonight so we probably won't be needing it 
but it's here and it's got this really adorable  
sort of honesty store the drinks and everything 
do have a price on it some of the things don't  
have a price on it and you basically you just pop 
some cash in this little pot I've never actually  
had an Airbnb do this before because they've got 
a pretty well stocked mini fridge well it's not  
it's regular size fridge and snacks and stuff so 
if we do get peckish tonight and don't want to go  
out we can just buy them straight from the Airbnb 
I've seen the view out the window Adriana still  
hasn't because she was talking to the lady I need 
to show you go out there go out the balcony oh
wow it's awesome when I peeked out of 
the window I could only see this side  
which also is very beautiful but the 
view that is so nice wow it's crazy to  
think that we're just like an hour and a 
half drive from Manila but it's very calm  
very different very green and very watery 
I was gonna say this is really nice yeah  
holiday in the holiday let's go out and 
check some more of the sites okay yeah  
yay or we can just sit here and watch our YouTube 
with popcorn now that'll be boring video later okay  
let's go okay let's see if I can figure this 
out oh that was really easy super easy thank  
you here she is or he is I feel like it's a he 
surely we haven't named it yet looks like Roger
He does look like a Rog. Rodgy. I like it
where we're heading right now is a food place 
for a particular dish that we've been looking  
for for quite a while apparently it's quite 
popular in the Philippines around Christmas  
time as you guys have probably already seen 
is probably one of the biggest celebrations  
in the Philippines the whole country is literally 
covered in like Christmas icing I was gonna say oh  
yeah anyway we're looking for this dish it 
is another dessert we do love a good dessert  
um the place that we're heading to was actually 
from a recommendation from our Airbnb host she  
said the last time she ate this dessert it was 
in this restaurant that we're heading to and  
apparently it's also quite pretty it's a nice 
location because we've got a car as well yeah  
it takes us five minutes to get there yeah 
easy peasy let's go have some more dessert  
thank you oh yes yes please please scan first 
before we go 
in yeah okay okay thank you thank you what's the 
QR code for queuing mandated guest queuing form  
so they want our date of visit first name last name 
queuing number okay so this queuing group number  
of people where we're from and our phone number 
I mean this could be a really popular place that  
has like hundreds of people visiting really look 
it up we just went with the recommendation so I  
hope we're not in number 267 people in 
front of us we'll be here until tomorrow just  
filled that in didn't really say anything so just 
check out what's what's going on it must be quite  
organized then if they've got a list like this 
oh the place is here that place looks nice yeah
hello okay great thank you thank 
you the view looks insane. look at that view
oh wow that view is insane it's like the view  
from a hotel room but 10 times 
better where did we end up. This is fancy!
oh this is so nice honestly I had no idea it 
was such a popular such a fancy place maybe  
we should have some actual real food here 
too yeah I think so yeah not just dessert  
I want to be here for a long time we came 
in here really not knowing what was going  
to be here we didn't even know what kind of 
restaurant it was we came here for dessert  
looks like we're having really fancy food 
I was just checking with Adriana do I have  
my bank card because I think this is going to be 
expensive I'm just looking at the menu now and  
it seems it's massive it seems to be Filipino 
food which is a good start we haven't really  
dipped our toes into Filipino food as of yet 
properly so stumbling across this place is  
really good actually because the menu is massive 
there's like 27 pages and I think I'm gonna go for  
a sisig which is like a pork with chilies 
and some other things as well you've made  
your choice right just need to get a drink and 
order now I'm really excited now all of a sudden
thank you thank you oh my God that looks 
so good I am obsessed with aubergine so if  
you have any other recommendations of any 
Filipino food with aubergine in it please  
let me know by the way this place is called balay Dako
seems extremely popular it's now like three  
four o'clock it's packed it's quite the vibe I've 
got a pork sisig which I've never tried before  
but it's basically pork mixed with pork 
face chilies some onions calamansi and  
chicken liver I think smells really good I like 
that kind of thing anyway so I'm gonna dig in
tastes like barbecue salty 
meaty oh my God nice tasty wow
oh this looks so good this 
aubergine just look at that
wow that aubergine just like falls apart
I love aubergine so give me any aubergine 
any day and I'll be happy already it is  
like Sweet Sticky a little bit spicy 
it's been like roasted somewhere for  
a long time there's like sesame seeds 
on top this is really delicious but I  
just can't believe that we're sat here in this 
place with this view it's like very surreal
Can we order puto bumbong? With cheese Ma'am?
Is that good? Yes Ma'am. Ok yes please.
okay so he knew what I was saying when I ordered 
it I'd never heard of it before we came to the Philippines
 but apparently it's really popular 
here so and it's purple it is steamed like a
glutinous rice cake and it has two different 
types of rice one of them being purple hence  
why it's purple but it also seems like it's served 
with butter on top some cheese on the side what  
looks like brown sugar and then coconut flakes 
so it's like sweet and savory I'm confused and  
intrigued so I want to try it I think we'll 
have to just put a bit of everything on yeah  
I think a bit of cheese is a bit random I think 
the cheese to me sounds a bit fun Cheers Cheers
there's so many flavors the cheese what's happening 
the cheese is cheesy it's like cheese cheesy it's  
proper cheese the brown sugar yeah it's nice the 
texture of the rice cake it's nice they're very  
hot the rice cakes the Butter's melted in there 
now it's really nice it is nice it's different  
I've never tried a dessert like this and there's 
so many flavors going on you first get the cheese  
yeah so it's kind of salty Savory and this is 
a Christmas dessert I think so they eat this quite a lot in the Philippines
but look at that I don't know it's nice with 
the brown sugar very good wow that was amazing  
food so delicious I can see why it's so popular 
and why our Airbnb host recommended it to us  
yeah and when the bill came I was like Hey 
1 400 pesos that's going to be a lot and it  
came through and it's 21 pounds or something like 
that for everything that we ate and for that view  
obviously it's a lot compared to a lot of 
things you can buy in Philippines but like  
you just said the setting and the quality of 
the food yeah yeah that's good but as we were  
sitting there it was getting slightly darker 
slightly darker a wind has started to pick  
up a little bit the clouds are coming 
in so we'll see how the next location  
goes because we're heading somewhere now 
and it's kind of very weather dependent
thank you
our Google Maps has just told us that if we 
drove there now without any delays we would  
get there just after sunset and the place closes 
just shortly after that so quick change of plans  
we'll go there tomorrow morning luckily we're 
filming tomorrow morning as well so you get to  
tag along anyway and tonight we'll just head 
back to our really cozy Airbnb that we haven't  
even had any time to spend in yet and you've seen 
that big bag of popcorn I'm gonna be diving right  
in there once this food settles because I'm 
super full and watch some Netflix or something  
and then we'll see you on the 
road tomorrow yeah road trip bye
good oh yeah sorry that's my chair ah Finders 
Keepers I found it first loser weepers then
