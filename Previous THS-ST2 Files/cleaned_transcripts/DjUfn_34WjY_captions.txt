We're gonna leave Thailand. Plans changed, as 
they do. Excuse me sir? We are looking for a  
Tapsilog? Hey champs! What's happening? Welcome 
to another episode of; "Tag Along With Chai".  
Today it's an emotional episode. We're gonna 
leave Thailand for a holiday in Manila. We're  
gonna arrive in Manila. That's going to be the 
episode. Arriving in Manila. In the Philippines  
and we are at Suvarnabhumi Airport
in Bangkok. It's going to be the first time after  
having a quick visit to the Netherlands "my home 
country" to visit another southeast Asian country,  
since the pandemic. Today we're flying with 
Philippine Airlines. We're arriving right in  
the morning in Manila. It's gonna be exciting. We 
not doing this alone. We're doing this with Ilona!
In the last year I've been several 
times on Suvarnabhumi Airport. 
It's actually really busy. I'm starting this 
video saying it's an emotional episode because,  
I've got a special bond, a special feel with 
Thailand and leaving it now, only for a few weeks,  
it's a little sad. But I know the philippines 
is coming and I'm pretty sure I'm gonna like it.  
It's the first time, the very first time for the 
both of us. So hopefully you'll join the journey?  
Let's go! We will arrive 5:30 in the morning 
and I'm not too sure champs. I've never been  
to Manila but I hope it's still a little bit of a 
chaos in the morning. Bangkok is slowly waking up  
at 5:30 in the morning so maybe manila is 
doing this as well? I'm not too sure. I'm  
really excited about this trip. We're going to 
be visiting a few islands. We're going to see  
some cool beaches. Some jungle. And there will be 
lots of local interviews. We're meeting people on  
the street. This channel is based in the north of 
Thailand but I'd like to show you, Southeast Asia,  
as well. And this is the first big trip outside of 
Thailand. Are you ready for the Philippines baby?!
How are you saying hello in the 
Philippines? Hello...? Mabuhay. Mabuhay.
Thank you so much. From where do you 
come from? We come from the Netherlands.  
But we're living in the north of 
Thailand. But we're we trie to show  
the Philippines now. Good. Hopefully. Enjoy it. 
How would you say thank you? Salamat. Salamat.  
The journey started. The journey just started 
and already we got helped by some friendly  
Filipino and Filipinas. It's a three and a half 
hour flight out of Thailand. The domestic flights  
within Thailand there's no food and beverages 
allowed. Still not. Here it is. But you have to  
wear and remain wearing your mask if you're not 
eating or drinking. It's really at eased. 50 full  
this airplane is so, it's getting there champs. It 
is getting there. Goodbye Bangkok. Hello Manila.
When you want to go to the Philippines right now 
you have to apply for a health pass. This is what  
we've done. It takes a few hours and then you get 
an email that you are approved for this health  
pass. You only have to fill in a few details. 
Where you're staying. Upload your vaccines.  
If you have a booster you don't need to get a PCR 
test. I don't have a booster personally. I've got  
two vaccinations. In Bangkok, I had to get a PCR 
test done and luckily that result was negative.  
Also here on the airplane. We have to fill in an 
arrival card and a luggage card for customs. And  
I believe that's pretty much it champs! There's 
some food on the way. Some drinks on the way.  
And this flight is only three and a half 
hours. We're gonna arrive really early  
in the morning. I don't think we're gonna sleep a 
lot in these three and a half hours but we'll see.
Only three hours left. We could choose between 
stir-fry beef and grilled chicken. Look at that!
We got some broccoli with it. The meat is, okay.
You're not going to get much better 
on the airplane. On the budget/  
economy class, I don't think. Anyway, this 
video is not about the food or eating.  
This video is about arriving in 
Manila. Let's see you at the landing.
Thank you so much! Welcome to 
the Philippines! Good morning!
And this morning because it's 4:30 not 
even 4 30! And the captain is saying it  
is already 27 degrees. So it's going to be a 
hot day! We all have to show the Health Pass.
We've just scanned the QR- code that 
we got from the online registration.  
And now we go through immigration. We're 
through! We're through! Look at that!  
I know in Schiphol in Amsterdam they have 
problems with the luggage but it looks  
like it's a little bit out of control 
here as well. Okay! There we go champs!
Wow.
I keep saying "Kap Kum Krap" We are  
not in Thailand anymore. We're gonna 
have to get used to that, I think.
Thank you!
No chaos yet. No taxi drivers yet waiting for us. 
But what we're actually gonna do; we're gonna take  
a bus down because we want to have the local 
experience. So we're gonna take the bus down  
to Makati. That's where we stay. It's 
still a little bit of a walk. Hello sir.  
Hello, how are you? That's a big gun!
Plans changed as they do. Also here in the 
Philippines. They're saying to us, also the  
airport police are saying to us, that there are 
no direct buses to Makati where we're going.  
We had to walk. Google maps as well is saying 
we have to walk the last bit. Apparently,  
there're no buses going there. Anyway, I 
thought of this straight away; This might be  
a scam. I'm not too sure. There may be buses. 
There may be not. We didn't do any research.  
It doesn't really matter. We might end 
up just taking a taxi. I don't know.  
But it's really early and we asked for an early 
check-in and the hotel got back to us and saying;  
You are you not able to do an early check-in 
because we're fully booked so we probably just  
gotta explore Makati. A little bit and have some 
breakfast. Have some proper Filipino breakfast  
and then finish up the day. We thought it was 
a good idea to get some cash out straight away.  
But the cash machines that we tried here cannot 
get the amount out that we want. We want to take a  
big amount out because they have fees at an ATM 
machine as they have also in Thailand. That's  
why we want to get some extra cash. What we did, 
plan B. We got.... Or Ilona got us a grab that's  
connected to a credit card so, we don't have to 
pay with cash. Hello sir. How are you? We like to  
get some breakfast after you drop us off. What do 
we need to eat do you think? Tapsilog. It's a Tapa  
course with egg and fried rice. We're gonna 
search for Taptsilog in Makati. Downtown Manila.
We dropped some luggage at the guest house. We 
couldn't check in yet. They're fully booked so,  
that's a good thing. Anyway Louis the taxi 
driver made us aware of a beautiful dish,  
a Filipino dish. Tapsilog. I 
never had it. Ilona never had it.
We're gonna have to try it. We've 
been asking around on the streets  
where to find it. It's just around the 
corner. We really don't know what it is but,  
we're going to have to find out. 
We're going to tell you in a minute  
if it's going to be tasty or not. Excuse me 
sir. We are looking for a tapsilog. Tapsilog?
Do you want the authentic one or...? 
Yeah the authentic one, really.  
When you turn left you'll see a sign. 
It's a restaurant it's called Tapa King.  
They have tapsilog there. Tapa King. 
Tapa King. It has a big red sign.
Well, good luck. Thank you so much. Thank 
you. Enjoy yourself. Thank you. Sorry, ma'am.  
I'm looking for a tapsilog.
That one. Tapa King. is it 
good? Yes. a little bit pricy.
It's pricey. Okay. Thank you krup. Thank 
you. Thank you "krap" I think thank you.  
We're not in Thailand anymore. We're actually 
in the Philippines. We are in Manila champs.  
How do you say thank you Filipino? I think it 
sounds similar and you can correct me? Salamat.
Wow, thank you.
Good morning. Hi sir. Hello, how are you? 
You don't have Tapsilot? We don't call  
it tapsilog. It's Tapa King Classic. It includes 
eggs. Garlic rice. And tapa. But we have different  
flavors of tapa sir. We have spicy. We have 
savory. We have shredded and adobo classic.  
Okay, so it's not the traditional Filipino style? 
It is the Filipino style. But we have varieties.  
A bisita, like you, can choose different kinds 
of tapas. Not only one kind of tapa but different  
kinds of tapas. Okay, what does basita mean? 
It means; customer. We call our new customers  
this. Which is much more Filipino warm. A warm 
welcome to our customers. We call them Basita.  
We love it. Shall we do one 
adobe classic? Yeah. Anda  
a crispy shredded, please. I'm not gonna lie to 
you. We didn't do any research on Manila. We only  
knew that there was an area here that is visited 
a lot. We thought; you know what? A new country  
we go somewhere touristic. Where it's clean and 
safe. But I wanted to take you to a traditional  
Filipino breakfast. And I've got the 
feeling that we are in a big chain. But  
it's going to be delicious. It's going to be 
delicious, for sure. We asked the locals. We asked  
like four or five locals on the way. They all 
send us... they all pointed us to this restaurant.  
I mean it's probably gonna be tasty 
but I'm not too sure how traditional  
this is gonna be. If you're watching and you're 
new to the channel and just popping in because  
this is about the Philippines or your Filipino? 
Please leave something in the comments. Because,  
are we at the right address here? Or is 
this a place that you normally Filipino  
don't go to? I'm really wondering. 
We've got crispy shredded beef. Cheers.
Nice.
Tasts good. Something similar to 
this you can buy in Thailand as well.  
Also in Indonesia. To be 
really honest. It's called.
I think it's called: "Moo Yong". "Abon, 
I think it's called. Really? Yeah.  
We're gonna give you some more local, proper local 
experiences. Now we are like an air conditioning  
building, in an expensive area of the city. We're 
going to go a little bit more local I think in  
future episodes for sure. This is the good stuff. 
This is what you want. Very tasty and tender.
Tapa King. I feel a little bit disappointed. 
Not by the food and not by the servers. The  
people are really nice. But this is a food chain 
and we didn't want to eat at the food chain. No,  
we want to go for proper traditional Filipino 
food. And I've got the feeling that we didn't  
really find it here. It was 
delicious. It was really good.  
But not the proper traditional local 
food, I think. The dishes were local but,  
we can get more traditional I believe. In the next 
few weeks we will be in the Philippines. Anyway,  
the first impressions of the city, are 
pretty good. The people are lovely. There's  
quite a bit of air pollution. It's 
a bit smoggy. But other than that...  
I don't know. We chose for an area where it's 
maybe a little western standard, I believe thank  
you for watching till the very end. Hopefully, you 
hit that subscribe button so you're able to follow  
the journey. The journey in the philippines. But 
also the journey in Southeast Asia. We're based in  
the north of Thailand. I would like to say from 
the heart of the Philippines. The capital city,  
Manila. Bye for now and stay champ! 
[I hope you enjoyed the subtitles 🙏🏼)
