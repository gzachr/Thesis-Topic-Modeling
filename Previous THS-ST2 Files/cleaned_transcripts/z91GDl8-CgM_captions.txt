There are so many boogers
in this cast.
Why do I have one
in mine right now?
It’s Manila Luzon and I am back
for All Stars 4.
These girls don’t know
what they’re gonna have
to compete against.
Since I’ve been on RuPaul’s
Drag Race and All Stars already,
I’ve been touring the world.
I’ve been doing albums and been
on commercials and on TV.
It’s a lot of fun.
I don’t even want to count
but enough years have gone
by where I’ve been working
since RuPaul’s Drag Race.
And it’s like I’m excited
to be back
because girl, three times,
no one gets that lucky.
So, I’m gonna show
these bitches how it’s done.
I think a lot of people remember
me for my blond streaky hair,
my fruit-based costumes,
and my big bird MacArthur Park
lip sync. I’m back.
I’m not a Teletubby no more
but if Miss Tammie
ever wants to be teleported
to Mars, I’m her girl.
Remember All Stars 1 Untucked?
Oh some of those girls
got into it that first episode.
The girls have no idea
what’s coming.
All Stars
is a different monster.
I never expected to come back to
All Stars.
I already did All Stars
and I had a great time.
So I never expected to be back.
Now I have the opportunity
to be back and bitch,
it is a scramble
to the shoe store for sure.
It’s a perfect excuse
to buy new shoes.
Having been so close
to winning the show before,
I know how much work it takes
to go all the way
in this competition.
So I’m up to going all the way
to the end, all the way again.
And I know that it’s a lot
of work and I’m ready for it.
I’ve been waiting a long time
to get myself back in this race.
When Latrice and I left
All Stars we were so upset
because we really were having
so much fun competing.
And we wished we could
have stayed longer.
You can’t go through an
experience like All Stars 1
and not have a personal
connection to a person,
let alone Latrice Royale.
You know what I mean? Come on.
Could you eliminate Latrice?
Could I eliminate
Latrice Royale?
Well I did it in
All Stars 1,
I don’t see
how I can’t do it again.
I really enjoy competing
in season 3 and I
had a lot of fun
on season 1
but I still haven’t got
the crown yet.
So if I have the opportunity
to go for it again,
bitch that crown is mine.
I know it, it’s the same size
as my head and my wig.
I’m so excited.
Put it on, I’ll take my
chopsticks out of my hair.
I will put that crown in my wig.
Let’s do this.
I will take my wig off
like Sasha Velour.
And have more crowns
falling out.
Bitch, I’m so excited.
I just want to
Photoshop myself in that
All Star Hall of Fame so bad.
But I’m gonna do it for reals,
like the real way by competing
for All Stars again.
And winning the crown
and getting my portrait
painted like this.
Hello. I am queen
All Stars number 4.
What was her name again?
Oh, the Asian one.
