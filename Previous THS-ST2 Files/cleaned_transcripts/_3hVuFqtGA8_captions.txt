wow that seeming from a fat person
classic
hey guys what's up it's your girl jiggly
Caliente here at onedown and I am going
to be reacting to some videos that they
have cooked up from
either my past
or what's going on right now so we'll
see and hopefully something crazy Jesus
I know you want this and I know that you
are such an amazing performer
yeah that was hard because I look at the
ring as like my little sister I kind of
adopted her and it's my chosen family so
when I found out that the ring is in the
competition like I have to still be fair
in
like comparatively to the other girls
the rings looked didn't live up to the
Filipina standard of being amazing and
sickening and all these girls are like
she's getting swallowed by them and I
felt bad but I had to tell her the truth
and I didn't say anything bad to her I
mean
when is the a-line dress ever sexy on
anybody
on Kim Kardashian the a-line dress
wouldn't be sexy okay just saying facts
or facts it is what it is
sorry today I love you but
the drastically right love you
there this
the best girl group from any franchise
period
this is everything
this is
wearing are everything
serving up
in the city
Asia's just a number oh my God is that
Marina I'm your Filipino winner like the
energy in the room when they did this
was everything
now she's not right there
hello God yes
this like truly was everything
also the good thing about this is now
this has replaced tala as the Filipino
queer
um theme song and now it is popovate and
I'm so happy that they have finally
changed it because it's been five years
of tala watching that just makes all the
hard work and all the sacrifices from
all the other Filipino queens that has
come before them to see this come in for
us to be one of the only Asian
franchises for the world to have
accepted and embraced drag race
Philippines the way they have really
proud of it and so happy for all the
girls because also we have the prettiest
past of any franchise period
[Music]
this is the trailer promo video for drag
race Philippines and I was so proud to
see this because like all the girls in
Paolo look so cool so amazing I love the
way they did this so the theme was
jeepney and it was just so cool to see
all the girls in like their deeply
inspired outfits
like nobody wants big bills in the
morning
of course the ring had to be the one
with the food reference
why
which Queen have you chosen I'm so sorry
that I have to send home
Manila
okay I love Manila and she is my sister
to and through but this was the best
power play
in Drag Race history
because Manila was
like on fire Manila is my best friend
and it sucks that it's her but
she was doing the best in the
competition and they got rid of her you
know how they say if you want to beat
the best beat the best well she beat the
best the girls beat the best they got
rid of her as soon as she tripped and
they were like oh no we are kicking you
down yeah they got her sorry Manila I
love you sis but oh that was rough also
a conspiracy theory I also sometimes
think that RuPaul's like low-key enjoys
when she eliminates girls I'm going to
hell for that and I'm so sorry Paul but
sometimes I could just tell that it is
you are tickled and you have to send it
home
you see that
that way she said sachet away it's like
she enjoyed that a little too much
not I love you I'm sorry no
that's one of the best power plays ever
on drag race history this is the gag
that got everybody
oh God me silky lip syncing and both in
leopard print okay in every lip sync you
can tell when RuPaul is like feeling
somebody because her eye is locked in on
that person
and she is locked in on this big
behemoth
and the ice is still full like the ice
was still like
solid how she has a whole bar in her bra
you know I put up a good fight though I
only I knew every word every lick of
that song
but I did the assignment silky had extra
credit so what people don't know about
that part is when I was lip syncing I
started doing floor work and then silky
started moving back and I screamed loud
and I was like stupid because I thought
she was about to sit on me when
something the size of a baby elephant it
looked like it's about to sit on you
you're gonna scream too jiggly Caliente
BMW body made wrong
wow fat shaming from a fat person
classic I could not but she's reading me
from our season four reading challenge
Jesus Christ my teeth
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
but the boobs alone and the voice that
voice was just so right
I only knew that GMA was a president and
I knew the whole I am sorry that part
but I didn't know all these references
but I was laughing the whole time
so when people don't realize it's like
throughout snatch game
um Marina and Eva were working together
like they were like lollyging all their
jokes and it was like landing and then
silhouette decided to play the game with
them so literally they were all playing
like this volleyball of like punch lines
and it was Landing left and right and
poor dinos tried to fight with um
silhouette and what they didn't show you
guys was all three of them attacked
Venus and poor Venus um boy everyone
that didn't have a prayer in hell
I am sorry I wasn't able to write
anything
they were so good like
but why is
yes
in my 41 years being alive that's the
first time I heard and I didn't know
that it was real that it's a real
flounder fish so
in Tagalog Ariel's best friend is called
and if I could just say it in Tagalog
first of all
[Music]
you know
oh my God where did y'all take this [ __ ]
up from first of all
that bang and those teeth thank God I
paid the 25 000 to get them fixed that
still stands to this day
in through the years I truly my career
would be nothing without everybody's
support so
thank you guys for
me and reacting with me uh so stay tuned
the finale of RuPaul's Drag Race
Philippines is coming to an end so
and uh yeah love you
foreign
