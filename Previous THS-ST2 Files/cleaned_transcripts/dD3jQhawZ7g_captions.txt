Jenjen's father-in-law told us,
He's getting ready to pick a coconut.
My father-in-law always gives generously for me.
Cut bamboo and wear a sickle.
I'm raising a lot of chickens near Jenjen's house.
The sound of chickens crying is endless.
Father-in-law who goes to get the leash to tie the sickle.
My father-in-law is making coconut-picking tools.
How about this one?
Something else.
*Reasons to make new coconut picking tools
I've been using that knife all the time.
Once you pick the coconut, you tear it down again.*
Father-in-law, I'll be back on the 15th.
15 days? / Yeah.
And then I'm gonna come back and sleep for a night.
Lucas and Sei have work to do today, so we have to go.
The Philippines has similar conflicts with Korea.
The relationship between Jenjen and his father-in-law is particularly good.
I'll pick the coconut over there.
You get it here.
(pointing at a tree) Coconut vinegar
Vinegar? / Yeah.
Where's the coconut vinegar?
It's in the coconut tree.
The palm trees are too high. I'll connect two bamboo trees.
He's trying to pick a coconut.
father and son
Throwing is very famous in the Philippines.
I still raise a cockfight in many houses.
Wow, it's really high.
Finally picking coconuts.
It's our first time picking coconuts.
I think he was staring at me in a really amazing way.
Coconut trees grow from 15 meters to 30 meters.
Wow, if that's right, I could die.
When Jenjen's father-in-law picks the coconut,
Jenjen's husband and brother-in-law are coming to pick up the coconut.
No, it's too much.
I think you're going through a lot.
You climb a tree and pick it.
They even talked about mangoes.
I told you it was enough.
He didn't understand, did he?
Indian mango?
No. Jenjen, you don't have to give me any more.
Jenjen, there's too much already.
And thank you so much.
I don't need any more. / Say thank you to your mother-in-law.
Thank you very much. / Thank you.
children united by a single bubble
I had a strange-looking friend, so I asked Joan.
It's called a turkey.
I've never seen it before.
When the turkey's loose,
He thinks it's his home.
He's not running away.
Hi, Jenjen. / Hi.
Jenjen's husband, grooming the coconut he had just laid.
I've never tasted a coconut before.
Half excited, half worried.
Or we can take a family photo later.
the whole family
Let's take a picture of the whole family.
How are you going to eat it? Do whatever Sei wants.
Pour it into a cup and let me drink it.
Baby
Maybe it's the first coconut that Sei drinks.
First time? / Yeah.
Is it good? Is it good?
Lucas, have a drink.
JENGEN: Any other cups? I don't know.
Joan: Ask your mother-in-law.
Why are they fighting?
You cut the coconut weirdly.
This feels like coconut water.
Coconut
It's good for excretion.
Huh? / Good for excretion.
But is it good?
Delicious
Say, look around.
Why are you all staring at me?
It's my first time seeing a foreigner.
Drink it, brother.
I had two.
Oh, it's delicious.
Huh? What is it?
This is supposed to be eaten with a spoon.
I can eat it. Try it.
This? / Of course. Try it.
be awfully good
Is this right to eat?
Honey, that coconut snack is all dried.
Sei doesn't taste good.
It's not sweet.
Do you like sweets? Put sugar in it.
I've always wanted to try the original.
Not for sale.
Isn't it savory when you chew?
It's not my favorite flavor.
Joan, Jenjen and her husband take a picture. / Yeah.
Let's take a picture of the whole family photo.
Jenjen, take a picture of you and your family first.
Then let's take a family photo.
Remember Jenjen? We took pictures of him.
Yeah, I saw Jenjen.
Where are you going to take it?
Where should we take it?
Let's take a picture over there.
One, two, three.
One more time.
My son's not in the picture.
Let's take a picture a little closer.
Here you go.
Thank you. / Thank you. I'll print the picture for you later.
Where should I look when I take a picture?
Just look here.
One, two, three.
One, two, three.
Let's do it one more time.
Thank you.
Wow, this is a great picture.
Oh, good picture.
It'd be awesome if the photo studio printed this out.
Pull me out of the photo studio.
Kindness to carry the coconuts as gifts to the car.
You're going to give me all this?
The situation helped by Jenjen's ex-husband.
I'm going to pick up the Indian mango.
He's really funny.
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you. Thank you.
I'll call Jenjen.
