so today we are at the new star casino here 
in cebu philippines and this is just recently  
opened like just a few months ago obviously i'm 
not gonna be able to film in the casino so this  
place is gorgeous though so far it's still they're 
still literally finishing it you can tell they put  
a hotel up and um did it completed just enough 
so they can open while they're still building  
i came across this restaurant here it's called 
moat 32 and i'm assuming i think it's just  
chinese food um but look it looks pretty cool look 
they got an applewood roasted 42-day pecking duck  
signature 32 cut 5500 which is about 100 u.s 
42 42 day old duck that's pretty cool they put  
that on the menu oh they got the bird's nest 
soup oh wow they got the bird's nest soup here  
4 000 which is about i think 70 75 u.s if i win 
now at the casino i'm gonna eat here but if not  
i'm not gonna eat here my cow lay on crispy 
rose i think this is kind of like a little  
you can order like some fries and some drinks 
yeah they got like boba teas and coffee right here  
so they really they really are still doing this 
place like this hallway i think this goes to the  
hotel and this hallway still got like stuff built 
it there's still like full force construction
so the name of this hotel is the philly 
hotel and wow this is a stunning absolutely  
gorgeous entrance my goodness you can see 
the ocean there's some nice plants outside  
look at check out this inside too wow i thought 
that was beautiful i'm gonna be honest this is  
one of the coolest hotel entrances i've seen in a 
while this thing is this thing is really nice okay  
so here we are i have jane with me here and jane's 
actually the ambassador the lobby ambassador here  
at the new star casino hotel and uh jane so it's 
a soft opening right now right yes we're still at

okay all right and jane is there anything you'd  
like to say to your fellow filipinos watching this 
hi everyone come visit the asset news star cebu  
and casino okay all right yeah the very first 
civil integrated resort in cebu oh nice okay  
there was the new star casino i'm a little bit 
bitter right now because they just took my money  
i'm not gonna lie they took uh i gave up a little 
bit of my money but if you saw in the last video i  
actually came away with 4 000 pesos but i gave 
some of it back today but anyways this is a  
beautiful casino it's brand new it's absolutely 
brand new all the machines are new it's even cool  
too they have these little phone chargers on the 
actual machines i've never seen that before but uh  
they're still building it it's gonna take 
a while still for it to complete and uh  
the soft opening has a great price right now 
actually i think for a place this new and nice  
i mean nine thousand pesos like 160 bucks u.s 
i mean i think that's that's a good deal so
