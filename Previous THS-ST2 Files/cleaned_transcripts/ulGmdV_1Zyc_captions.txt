it looked great Tom and Tom's look nice but  
I don't want to uh I don't want to do that 
right now we're sticking strictly Filipino  
today we're in the safest city Davao in 
the Philippines so we got to show it in  
good light and maybe we can get some coffee 
from like a little shop around the corner here
this guy's got some quick quick nicer  
sir do you have coffee no coffee right do you know 
I can find coffee over there okay okay thank you
uh man Philippines really does have a lot of 
malls they really do there's malls everywhere here
people love to go to the mall here in the  
Philippines too here we go I think 
I found a coffee spot right here
I don't know if they have coffee though let's see
you have coffee right huh fluffy yeah yeah
foreign
but no coffee there either
find some coffee man yeah I think I found 
a spot this bakery's gotta have coffee  
and baked goods go hand in hand you 
guys have coffee coffee coffee yeah
um which one's the least amount of sugar
yeah I need one with no 
sugar or little sugar please
all sugar okay okay which one's the number 
one Philippines coffee is it Milo no yes  
what is it can you hold it up for the camera oh 
Nestle original yeah okay I'll take one please  
what one yeah one Nestle 
original Philippines favorite  
and that's the original Philippines flavor
is that cold water oh it's hot
okay man thank you how much yeah sorry the camera  
is uh yeah you want to say something to 
your fellow Filipinos the best company
yo I guess this whole packet fits in 
this little cup it seems like a lot  
of coffee for a small amount of water but 
I guess this is where it goes so let's see
okay so there's nothing that's going to cool 
you down on a hot Philippines day it's like a  
hot cup of Nestle coffee so this is it I think 
it's cooled down enough so let's give it a shot
oh that's sweet sweet and coffee tasting 
deliciousness so I'm gonna drink this coffee  
and then see where we go next Okay so there's 
a lot of Indians walking around here and I just  
talked to a couple of them and they actually 
go to they got a medical school here in Davao  
and they come here they're I talked to a 
couple right now and they're on a five year  
the medical degree Aaron Davao so he said 
it's common a lot of Indians come to the  
Philippines for University I didn't know that 
that's the first time I had seen that hey  
that's the first time I had seen that I've never 
seen that before that's right yeah yeah can  
you can you say a couple things on the camera 
real quick so you go to college or university
work there yeah a clerkship like your 
apprenticeship oh okay okay so your last  
year okay so how long have you been in Davao this 
is uh four years oh wow four years okay all right  
brother thank you thank you yeah see there you go 
so I talked to a dude right there he was he's in  
his fourth year here in Davao he said clerkship 
I think or he said he's working at the hospital  
I think that's like his apprenticeship I think he 
would say in the U.S I'm not too sure or his uh  
um maybe he said intern I don't know it doesn't 
matter but pretty interesting oh it is hot it  
is hot out here that hot coffee didn't cool 
me down at all I thought for sure it would
okay so just as soon as I stop recording that 
look what I turned around to the corner and seen  
coconut some fresh coconut it's Buco yeah okay can 
I can I have one uh cup please uh one okay yeah
is there sugar or just juice
a lot of sugar or no
oh thank you
how much peso 20
. okay thank you all right  
let's try this fresh juice let me know 
also if that's the right price 20 peso
oh my God that's so good fresh that's so good
I think there's a lot of sugar in 
that but it's okay it's worth it
plus honestly everywhere you go you basically 
get doubled up on although devour is supposed to  
be a nicer City so maybe maybe uh that people are 
just more honest with the prices overall so it is  
what it is I understand everyone's just trying 
to make a dollar you know okay so let me just  
say because I haven't said yeah this is my first 
impressions of Davao and honestly it's a cool City  
when I got in here it's a it's a little more quiet 
it's kind of like if you live back home in the US  
it's kind of like a phoenix or um in Tucson in 
comparison to the city and the activity in the  
city the city is obviously bustling but it's 
not as crazy as Cebu and Manila a little more  
relaxed here you could say honestly is what I 
feel like so this is a cool City I like it I  
really like the fact that it's supposed to be 
the most safe City because then you can really  
not have to worry about it I mean I mean honestly 
you're fine walking around in most cities anyways  
I think during the day people probably argue that 
but as far as like this place is locked down safe  
I think that's pretty awesome supposedly the 
former president um this is where he's from so  
I guess they keep the city very safe so anyways I 
hope you enjoyed this video thank you for watching  
and we'll see you next time and also we're going 
to a big famous market right here and that's  
actually going to be in the next video I don't 
want to make this video too long see you later
