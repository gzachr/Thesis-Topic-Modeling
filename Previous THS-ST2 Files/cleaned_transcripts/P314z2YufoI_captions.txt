Sydney only flies to Manila if there's a
International Airport
mm-hmm

Cebu Pacific is just Manila
yeah if if I wanted to fly with was it
Philippine Airline or a Singapore
I can fly from Singapore Airline from
Canberra and then fly from Singapore to Cebu

yep yep
and  see you..
what's your thoughts on Australia?
that's your question ?
I'm asking you What do you like
you like what do you not like
it is quite good ?
Quite good. (ok sign)
Thant doesn't answer anything
Crickey! Bonza !
I like Australia esp Canberra where he lives cos if you
like quiet place and very organized and so clean
and environmental-friendly
alots of animals ,ducks, everywhere ,birds
rabbits, kangaroooos and I didn't see
Koala though
Fox but I didnt see Fox
wild animals but I didn't see any thing
yep I can it's fresh
though it's cold
but
just have  fire and
haha not everyone has fire
yeah
it's just cold just you need just to to
have jacket or they called it it's
jumper and yeah well it's everything is
perfect except side Lincoln I like me
Donnie also were perfect
his parents leaves but it's quite a
small town but it's quite small it's
also peace peaceful I like quiet and
it's good people are nice so friendly
it's igneous quite quite we are right
now in Sydney and it's quite according
to him is quite scary no offense it's
just crowded so crowded afraid of
Canberra yeah I mean it's not quite as
crab that's the rule and I've never
actually when I go to Manila I just stay
in the airport so my experience with
mondello so it's clean and lovely
probably very different to people that
go out into the actual city cebu is a
bit more chaos I think when I think when
I will live in Canberra I think it's it
is nice but sometimes see you will feel
homesick because every people is busy
like they're not solely buck and they
didn't make friends with neighbors we we
know our neighbors but we know one of
them others
okay we take a garbage bins out to the
street yeah blending in is like house
like people just just jump into another
house and hang out and talk to you and
say it out to your house and looking out
on when anything Jimmy
so come pass by and talk to the
strangers who pass by it's up to the
universe was passed by and yet there is
just a busy work or if they wanted did
you go to Jim Jeep school go back work
and then and then I'm the food kind of
for the dig it is my toast breakfast
photos and then another stops and toast
think they are very simple in terms of
like meal yep but it's when it's special
occasion it's very fancy
unlike us that we can have just eat
toast we need something like breakfast
had to with rice with egg with so much
style probably proper meal
hey make me homesick the food sometimes
and the people around I I have seen very
few Filipino in Canberra
so there are agents but mostly like
Chinese how do you find things are
simple I do not like the weather if it
constantly 35 degrees is a bit much for
me especially for the community the
people are nice except for that one taxi
driver who charged me too much money and
then he was parked on the same spot the
next day outside I come to this early
time to be tired running again
yeah I was very absent everyone else was
lovely except the weather ended that's
right except the weather and that one
taxi driver if you are going to choose
where to leave Australia are full of
things I can't afford to live in
Australia
I like the housing prices I like the
real estate market in the Philippines is
quite good yeah this is going to be an
argument later
I like Australia for like a benefits
from the government but the kind of
lifestyle
I like Philippines of course yeah if we
were just you know if we have power to
the Philippines and and we get pork we
both get workman will they pay no
survived oh maybe bill survived yeah you
what they will just cross each other's
country
and I think the audience's but all the
answers

think we have covered everything except
for very personal reasons
yeah so you would just you could just
