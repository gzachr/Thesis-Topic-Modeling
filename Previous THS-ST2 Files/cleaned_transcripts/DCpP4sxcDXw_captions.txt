Hello and good afternoon from Roxas Boulevard 
or Rojas Boulevard or the big Boulevard  
of Manila! Whoa! Hi everyone! Today we met 
with our friend Vincent, who, at the moment,  
is at the toilet and well we're gonna explore 
a little bit around. He wanted to show us how  
Manila looks like on the weekend, so let's go! 
Hello nice to meet you! Very nice and friendly  
people around here near the beach okay and now 
we're on this over the Hang Bridge thingamajig  
preparing to go down to the beach check out that 
beach there what do you think oh okay and there's  
a building here this is technically the U.S 
embassy so we're not allowed to go past that line  
let's go and check out the beach area 
look Digi there's a horse and carriage
that's so nice where should we go this side I 
think this way inside ah this exit okay thank  
you so actually if we want to enter the 
beach we have to enter from the other side  
okay cool let's go to the other 
side to come back here yes
okay that was easy and not even full and now we 
are on government property yes and collection of  
dolomite sand and Pebbles is strictly prohibited 
so we're not allowed to take any rocks or any  
memorabilia from here oh okay no seashells for 
me then but the beach actually looks very nice  
yo Michael like if you look from up top yes I 
don't know why I had the impression that this  
beach being so close to the old city center it 
might not be the cleanest but actually if you come  
here and you take it out it's nice it's nice it's 
clean it's a perfect hangout spot for local people  
I like it and the thing which is kind of weird is 
not Sandy I mean it's not sad it's just kind of  
Rubble gravel and Pebbles yes kinda somehow 
reminds me of the biggest in Croatia more  
or less same thing and it's called Boulevard's 
Beach because it's made from Dolomite Rock and  
it's an artificial Beach so technically here was 
not a beach before but now there is one and well  
we're gonna go explore it bring your 
sandals let's check out the water and
everyone is going okay so there
guys
palm trees yes and technically you're not allowed  
to swim inside or you can swim but 
the sunset was moving I wonder why
we have some windage over here yeah it's some 
wind here going on I think I know why you're  
not supposed to swim because there's a lot of 
stuff in the water but well looks nice and you  
can come here you can apparently how do you call 
that GG windsurfing right yes okay you can do  
windsurfing but you cannot swim uh then how do you 
get on the surfboard in the middle of the water
yo guys did you see how many people they are here 
there are so so many people I think there are  
maybe a thousand people stretched all over this 
Coastline it's really really beautiful there's  
like the U.S embassy is very close nearby so maybe 
some of the people working there they're coming  
here daily just having sunbathing and enjoying 
the waves just hearing the waves and looking  
at all the people doing like uh windsurfing and 
not swimming but like doing uh water sports so  
this looks pretty pretty cool I what I like most 
about this place is that the gravel even though  
like there's no sand you feel super comfortable 
like being here and you can feel like there's a  
very cool and nice Vibe about this place people 
like to take pictures here have a picnic just  
come and take pictures of the sea and talk with 
their friends have a beer sit on the side of the  
water which is really really nice and I also love 
the palm trees over there there's a line of palm  
trees if you can see them they're really really 
pretty and give like a super exotic vibe to this  
place in the middle of Metro Manila like this 
is the insane bit of it like you wouldn't expect  
to find such an oasis of home and a Cool vibe 
a nice vibe in the middle of Metro Manila and  
there's this guy that was doing the windsurfing 
before now he's trying to bring the the shoot down  
okay he's struggling a bit he looks like a very 
good place to do windsurfing because you have  
wind here right so you will catch some some speed 
here so pretty pretty nice place there's a lot  
of I like it I wonder if there are food places 
around here because I'm feeling a bit too hungry  
maybe we can find something to eat as well while 
we're sitting on the beach and look there's a huge  
rock over there there's a lot of people hanging 
next to the truck yeah let's go check it out  
because it's uh because it's a bit more Shadow 
my our name of our blog is dodo explorers thank  
you so much I already saw that you already saw our 
videos already I I think so that's so cool so the  
Explorer is it on YouTube yes it's on YouTube by 
the way what do you think about this beach do you  
like it very much it's actually my third time 
already going here okay and I kind of like it  
it's cleaner than before this is this is used 
to be like garbage site or something and okay  
that our president has thought of something 
something happened under the administration  
of our president I mean it's way better having 
a beach than any kind of garbage area right yeah  
it's cool so much fun here there are a lot 
of people but what is it that people do here  
normally no they just want to see the sunset 
usually okay because this actually closes at 6  
00 PM oh so it's closes yeah okay so this is 
only until 6 PM okay thank you very nice nice  
to meet you man what's your name Joey Joey 
nice to meet you Michael bye-bye okay very  
nice people here at the beach and we found 
out that uh this place used to be uh garbage  
area and the government turned it into a beach 
so that people can enjoy it cool very good job  
Manila I like the way you're thinking so I found 
out one cool thing uh they built this beach during  
the pandemic time so that's so cool interesting 
that means that uh people have a new spot where  
to hang out and chill also another cool thing 
about this beach is the fact that there's a lot of  
ships there in the in the sea and they are there 
because they want to reclaim the land actually and  
build I think four artificial Islands somewhere 
in the middle of the sea so technically this is  
going to be the new Dubai or Philippines okay oh 
I'm good I want something to eat that's so nice
okay interesting options you have ice cream 
I would like to get one of these things  
no idea what they are but they look nice
