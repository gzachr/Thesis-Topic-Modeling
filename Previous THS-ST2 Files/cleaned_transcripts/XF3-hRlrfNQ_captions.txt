on the table for the people who
created these so i just love that so

yeah um we're looking at these before we
started filming and we were reminiscing
of justin remember i mean we we used to

hole you just hop right here we're like
you want you want to like

there's not much space here
but yeah just remembering him yeah this
is these are brought back memories
for us so thank you so much angela thank
you so much
i think it is called pantos
[Music]
it's a cookie a biscuit biscuit
biscuits okay and it looks like they've
been um in business
since 1950
so yeah has a bit of history there very
interesting
it's raya the biscuit very thing
yeah bisects
um
are they stuck together or
no oh they come apart they're very very
thin
interesting
that is so interesting i i thought a few
few pieces yeah
yeah i thought they were like flaky
biscuits or something
but now these kind of look they kind of
remind me of like flat pringles
[Music]
the more you chew
the sweetness comes out
yeah
so that's not possible i didn't
i didn't taste anything me neither but
after three seconds the sweetness comes
from the inside
you see it's very rustic to me but i
think
i had a better bite
few
pieces i do the same i did the same just
now
i like it it reminds me of the homemade
crackers that i used to make
a long time ago
yeah
once upon a time i used to make homemade
crackers
i don't even remember why but i made
those and these remind me of those how
do they make this
same biscuit yeah i wonder i wonder why
and there's also a slight saltiness to
it as well
so it's delicious yeah but what i like
about it is that it it's i don't know
it's very nostalgic and
it's very rustic
and moving on to the next one the next
one also looks a little bit rustic to me
and this is from a company called
kanjing and these are ras and for some
reason there is japanese written it says
tamago iriku
which means
cookies made with eggs
so i'm thinking maybe it will remind us
of boro we have these
that's right
and it's made with eggs
they're round though they're like little
balls but these are ring ring shaped
like little donuts really light
crunchy down bottle no
no
but
tastes a little bit like boro but not
it's eggy
sugar
[Music]
i like it
this is also very nostalgic
we have something similar to this in
japan don't we
it tastes very very similar texture
taste flavor
but maybe different um
shape i don't like the gentle sweetness
yeah i feel like my mom would love these
she likes sweets like this
next one is no sugar added peanut butter
peanut butter above peanut butter
so it's from
miami
i see
okay so this is interesting peanut
butter ah okay
i think i've had something like this
before
from um hong kong
i think lauren said us something similar
to this
it looks very fragile so i think we
should be very careful
and there's no sugar added so i don't
wonder just the peanut sweet
maybe i don't know
so let's open it up
yup yup super flaky
oh yeah you have to pick it up very
carefully
okay
wow
that is full of peanut flavor
it's like a solid peanut butter turkey
sauce between frankie and powder
but it has so much flavor yeah and i
can't believe there's no sugar in it
it's sweet sweet
peanut sweetness
peanut sweetness
okay
so it only lists four ingredients in
here peanut
isomalt
glucose and salt i see
i see
heat refrigerated once up and okay
okay put it in the refrigerator
after this
i like this i i love peanut snacks
peanut candy i like peanut butter meat
too oh that's delicious i love the
texture so light and flaky
okay so the next one
i don't know how you pronounce this
company rgis
is that r or is that a y
um
it's r it's r g i e s
g's delicacies
is the first to give you a new variety
of butterscotch squares mixed with sweet
luscious dried mangoes to complete your
sweet tooth fantasy
let's see
our sweet tooth fantasies
well i definitely do you have a sweet
tooth and you like mango
yes
yes so these are butterscotch squares or
mango bits
i can't even imagine what it's gonna
taste like it looks like a brownie
what i cannot expect that
look at that
smells like butter
[Music]
looks like a cake
a squishy cake
squishy it's like a buttery hawaiian
patamuchi
oh it's a little bit like butter mochi
but not as chewy
not that's chewy but like between
mochi
yeah like a buttermochi and brownie this
is delicious though and mango inside oh
so good
the tropical fruitiness of the mango the
butterscotch is also very good it's very
nice it's like burnt butter
the texture i love the texture
brownie and
butter mochi okay this is satisfying all
kinds of stuff in me
my sweet tooth my my brown addiction my
my mochi
obsession
the next one is
same
as the mango one the same company same
company but has got squares
with cashew cashew okay
that's interesting
no it sounds simpler
so this is oh this is the original it
says this is just
original butterscotch covered with a
tropical cashew nuts to give you a
delicious mouth-watering experience oh
immediately visually you can see the
cashew nuts the smell is different
it tastes different too
the mangoes
sweet sweeter not sweeter this one it's
not super sweet it's nutty nutty
nutty but with the same texture thank
you seriously the brownie
i like this one too
the mango one is for those who have a
sweet tooth this one like you said it's
not that sweet
it's almost like i could eat this for
breakfast
way less sweeter than say pop-tarts in
america pop-tarts remember pop-tarts
we we did the taste test with the
pop-tarts and
omg those pop-tarts were sweet
or very sweet
i remember eating pom-poms when i was a
kid my mom never bought it for me but i
had it at a friend's house
and and i thought it was such a luxury
because it was so sweet but now i eat it
it's like too sweet for me
when i was a kid i think i liked it
okay next we have um
i think this is from the same company
jeez
these are cheesy butterscotch
cheesy butterscotch yeah they're in a
different package
[Music]
okay immediately you see some cheese on
the surface of it
this one a little bit
love this one
crumbly but also you know still
has that nice chewiness to it yes
but this one has the savoriness of the
cheese mixed in with the butter this is
good for party prata
all of it is good for party butter
uh
these mango and cassis um for dessert
dessert this one is a starter
oh this is so good
oh the cheesy butterscotch square
next is
choco crunchies
looks like chocolate cookie
i think these are six chocolate covered
biscuits
this one is
maybe the the sibling to nabisco
so these are all wrapped individually in
aluminum foil they're quite thin
and on the inside yeah there is a
biscuit like it said
looks like dark chocolate it's kind of
dark
it's very pleasant
this one it's a straight
the butterscotch squares are very
special
whereas these
these are something that
that remind me of some of the things we
have here in japan
but the chocolate is very nice there's
nice bitterness to the chocolate
i love this chocolate flavor
finally we have virgi's mango tartlets
this is from virtues homemade products
this is already exciting me by the way
they look they're individual mango
tartlets mini tarts oh
wow
love mango me too they say again love
mango i i love it too of course all of
these are made in the philippines nobody
can't wait
the outside is very flaky it's kind of
chewy the mango fruit is a bit chewy
it's like mango jam
because you should eat the package
the outside short bread today right the
ingredient list says it's flour butter
mangoes and sugar
and that's all so maybe the outside is
made with rubber and butter
it tastes very simple
it's very simple which is why i was a
little bit speechless
it is very natural it tastes almost
homemade
i like it i once again these are very
rustic like the first
very interesting
[Music]
and you know you do taste the mango but
it's not very strong
and i'm thinking it's most likely
because
they're using real mangoes there's no
artificial flavoring
i think a lot of times like
mango flavored candy or you know some
fruit flavor candy they add things to it
to
intensify the flavor of the fruit
whereas this one there's just four
ingredients flour butter mangoes and
sugar only four ingredients
wow
okay so we have come to the end of this
taste test oh my god we tried the safer
we tried the sweet snacks and went
through the entire box that angela sent
us
for the sweet one what are your
favorites mango beets oh butterscotch
squares mango beets really that's your
favorite
why can i ask why mango lava and this
texture is very sensational and also the
butter flavor is really good my favorite
are from the same brand but the cheesy
butterscotch squares i never thought i
would be choosing that one but that one
was for me as you always say a taste
sensation
cheese and butterscotch i never thought
to pair those two flavors together
delicious delicious delicious it's a
stable you know i don't know
well i think it's both i think it's it's
a satisfying the savory and the sweet
tooth in me well thank you so much guys
