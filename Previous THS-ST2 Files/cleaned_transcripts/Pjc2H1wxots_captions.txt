it is me anthony and david and we are here  
back again with another reaction video 
video oh i forgot that you say it  
no now guys we've been away for you know about 
like six months but the reason that we were away  
no six months six months the reason we were ways 
because we had a copyright issue on the channel  
and they were gonna delete the channel if we 
kept posting we kept posting so uh basically  
what happened is they gave our channel a copyright 
strike and what happens with a copyright strike is  
somebody did not like us making a reaction and 
they said because this person made a reaction  
with our video uh we're gonna strike down that 
channel and we just felt well on youtube it's  
three strikes you're out and we did not want to 
risk our channel getting deleted so we felt best  
to wait the six months for it to like clear off 
our record we don't have it anymore so we're good  
but that's the reason that we were away but 
we're super super excited yeah it was tough it  
was it was tough but we're back and we're going

how like no we don't understand the language how 
you can vocals are just like you still feel like  
it's so yeah bro i feel like sad like yeah i 
feel it like you know saying that's i think  
that is a that's a sign of good music yeah do 
you know what i'm saying if you can understand  
it like obviously we have the we have the 
subtitles so it helps us have more context  
but just be able to hear in their voices that 
they mean every single word that's crazy that's  
amazing that's why they blew up so fast i know 
dude i know all right let's go let's finish this
foreign
um
is
i'm so glad that they added the dad too yeah 
i think they're doing like a a family thing so  
the mom is the eyes and the dad is the feet oh 
yeah yeah they're doing it like that wait put  
your mic up a little bit but i get i get what 
you're saying though that's actually here we  
know yeah yeah just put it up a little bit that's 
all okay but yeah like i i when i seen that i was  
like okay i see how they're how it's going now so 
i want to see how dude you know what you know i  
love i love you know this is why i got so many 
views it says 725 000 likes for a reason yeah  
when you can make music that touches everybody 
like there's no even if you don't you know if if  
you don't have a a mother that you're proud of 
or a father that you're proud of you know there  
is some type of figure in your life that you look 
up to like that and you can relate to this do you  
understand what i'm saying like especially when 
people you know there's so many situations where  
people going through so much and you know their 
parents are there to guide them through everything  
that's super super valuable that's super super 
valuable and i'm actually so happy that i think  
this might be one of their most viewed videos 
i'm happy that it's this because it's something  
that's not super flashy super pop crazy it's 
just pure heartfelt emotion and substance and  
for that to get 35 million views that makes me 
super excited i don't know about you but for me  
these are the kinds of this is the kind of music 
that i would rather become popular because it  
has so much behind it you know what i'm saying 
yeah yeah i know what you mean yeah but yeah  
i like this too it's really good it portrays a 
lot like what how i see it is if you if you've  
lost someone like a role model like that like 
a mom or a dad that they're still a part of you  
that's yeah that's with the 
visuals and stuff yeah exactly yeah  
yeah okay but we're about almost we're more than 
halfway so let's see what the rest has in store
oh
foreign
foreign perfect for like the end of a movie
what is that just
i get the title now because mom mom and 
dad is ma and pa wow right i'm pretty  
sure right yeah he just said oh we just got 
a subscriber isabelle dravette thank you for  
subscribing thank you so much all right go back 
a little bit i think the way they said it yeah
that has to be it right yeah that's such a 
great that's a clever title right here and  
plus how they said they have the map and they're 
not oh yes i think that's what they were saying  
yeah dude that's so dope  
okay let's see the rest of this and then we can 
give our final thoughts because this is i love
i'll this the one taking 
care of you and this is crazy
okay i think that's it man david that 
is crazy go ahead you tell me yours  
like you said how you can see it at the end 
of the movie i can already portray how the  
movie would be like how the mom and the dad 
do does uh they did a lot for their child  
and now the child is all grown up and yeah you're 
trying to go out into the world or yeah yeah  
something like that exactly that's why i see 
it in my head exactly how they i love how the  
double meaning with the map and uh ma and paw yeah 
that's that's really i love how they did that too  
that's really good i was this is i i see why they 
have 35 million views on this it's just i really  
do feel like it's one of their best songs it's 
really really good dude it's really really good  
really good i love how the singing too like the 
singing no this thing was the single was chills  
it was perfect really good it was perfect 
oh i was gonna say something um damn i was  
gonna say something about um oh for example

um what what even even the um the little cross 
in the middle it has m a p a oh i see that  
wait yeah oh yeah that is true but uh like 
i was gonna say like i was saying um damn  
it i was about to say so you [ __ ] sorry sorry 
okay like i was saying uh i feel like this song  
uh touches touches the hearts of a lot of kids 
because you know when especially in like um  
i would say i'm hispanic in a lot of hispanic 
households right yes see the kids the kids dream  
is to be able to make it so that they can take 
care of their parents and take care of their  
family like that's like a main goal especially 
for the especially for the guys you want to go  
out and you want to work super hard and make
