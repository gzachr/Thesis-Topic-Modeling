are you a student what do you do uh I am
working now I'm a pulse Mentor agent
how's that because I know there are many
of them around here how's working as a
boss
at first it's hard you know because you
need to adjust your
schedule yeah schedule especially

know you need to adjust and also with
the people you're gonna deal with random
people some are removed some workers you
know are they mainly North American
clients like in Canada U.S uh it's a U.S
Camp actually are you single are you in
a relationship
is it complicated
okay have you dated anybody in the past
oh yeah I bet oh yeah so many guys like
to see now I'm joking have you ever
dated a foreigner oh yeah I did okay and
how old was he
was 40 40. 40. okay so a quite the age
Gap there what do you think of the age
Gap does it matter to you
so I don't know it's really depends with
a person
but for me I am more like older guys
yeah they're more mature you know
yeah they're very different than younger
guys I guess right because they might
still figure things out why do you think
that is a lot of Filipinos don't seem to
care what the guy looks like as long as
he's caring loving and supportive right
so age is just a number I guess
I agree with that I mean for me thank
you for your time
hi what's your name hi I'm Mara and how
old are you I'm 19 years old are you
from Cebu yeah I am from Cebu and what
are you doing these days working
studying I'm actually studying in

right so this whole video is about
basically dating foreigners have you
ever dated a foreigner no
I haven't tried eating a farmer have you
ever had any boyfriends I don't you
never had a boyfriend come on okay what
about this what do you find attractive
in a guy
well if that guy exerts so much effort
in our relationship and I'll find more
attractive does age matter to you no
otherwise give me a limit it's got to be
a limit right so what's the um
the guy should be
you never thought of it right so now I'm
putting you on the spot so maybe 26
years old number seven what if he was
like 29 but he met all your criteria 10
years older what if he was 10 years
older but he had everything you wanted
in a guy well that's fine because my
parents has 10 years ago so it's okay

it doesn't matter what if it was like 59
