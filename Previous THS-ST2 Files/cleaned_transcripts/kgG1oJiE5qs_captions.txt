Manila, oh nana
I love to party with my friends in Manila.
Nothing compares to parties here in Manila.
The party's hot in Pilipinas
I'll show you how, come with us
Manila oh nana!
Tonight is the night to party it up, practice
my pogi face,
So many places in Manila, party all night
and day,
We Filipinos save our pera, it's time for
us to play,
So in the house we take our first shots!
And so we always say ohhhh,
Play songs on the gitara
And let's eat some pulutan,
And we take it like,
Oohhhhh, we drink from the same baso, which
goes around, hot shots shots shots shots
Manila oh nana!
So many ways to party here in Manila.
We Filipinos live to party and have fun.
It's time to party in Manila,
Mabuhay, Pilipinas
Manila oh nana!
Next it is time to ride a jeepney, I'm passing

To find a bar in Quezon City, the night is

It feels so good to party here in Manila,
These hot shots taste like warm, candy cinnamon
hearts,
Does Cinnamon mean that it's healthy,
Whatever, time to party,
Parties in Manila.
