Hello Gigi where are we today? Today we are 
doing exactly what a good Filipino would do  
namely celebrating with them and honoring with 
them yes that's why we came to the cemetery  
and apparently to get inside you have to go 
past through a big crowd and a big security  
okay seems like you're going 
to the fair not to the cemetery  
but somehow there's a lot of people here 
let's go check out OTG let's go inside
easy I never seen so many people coming to the 
cemetery like ever we have this thing in our  
country as well but it's not as big as this I 
mean this is something you don't see every day
you explain better what's happening today because 
I am having a little bit of a trouble I hope I can  
I connect like for everyone I'm trying to get all 
of it in and there's too much happening around me  
and I don't understand anymore so many countries 
in Europe America South South America yeah they  
celebrate Day of the Dead Or All Souls days in 
Mexico I think today also maybe okay or Halloween  
in America for some reason the queen yes is also 
coincides with this celebration yes and people  
come to the cemetery to honor their dead their 
dead yes okay so far so good this celebration has  
a very deep meaning in the culture of the Filipino 
people because they are very religious and this is  
why like death and the passing has a very great 
importance in the life of a Filipino family  
so this is why you could see you can see you 
can experience here actually for the only time  
in the year it is supposed to be like the 
two Realms of the living and the dead Okay  
so they are very very thin okay and uh the 
curtain that separates the two Realms of the  
living and the dead today is very thin and the 
birds can go from one side to the other okay so  
they can cross her we have five people today 
celebrate like they believe that they're dead  
are very close now to their to the grounds here 
to the cemetery and they come here to pay their  
respects to bring snacks to Big flowers okay 
so far we're only halfway through inside the  
cemetery I'm wondering what's up ahead because 
I see a lot of people going that way and I'm  
curious to see and there are people what's 
happening there are people selling food oh  
yes they're barbecuing and they're having fun 
kids playing over there I mean it's not your  
sad day it's not a sad celebration it's like a 
kind celebration okay remembering the people who  
passed normally when you come to a cemetery it's 
a little bit creepy but somehow this cemetery is  
more joyful and it's very beautiful first time 
we are here in the Philippines what can you say  
about Philippines it's beautiful and the people 
are super amazing and very very welcoming and I'm  
happy we came here and it's actually the food is 
very good I gained some pounds since I came here  
and uh yeah today is the first celebration we 
see like also it's your first time came here yes  
it's a beautiful bouquet you have there
beautiful
[Music]  
there are so many streets that's what I wanted 
to say now there's a lot of streets you feel  
like in a small village here somehow but 
all these kind of buildings around I had  
3 23 and Main Avenue there's a lot of 
streets here wow oh there's a mini bus
that's very interesting thank you
okay also one interesting thing is the fact 
that there's a lot of cars like this somehow  
in the background and they are zooming past 
you there's a policeman on motorcycles there's  
a ambulance here there's a fire truck 
here there's everything you can imagine  
and I think maybe because there's a lot of people 
so that's a good thing I mean people are taking  
care of people and as far as I know this is the 
first celebration since the pandemic finished so  
interesting we get to experience the Day of the 
Dead together with the people here again for the  
first time the All Souls day or Undas as known 
in the Philippines is a big big celebration here  
and it is considered a family celebration because 
Filipino culture is very family oriented so they  
believe they're honoring they're dead those late 
rest um through coming here in the cemetery and uh  
lighting candles flowers laying flowers 
and basically sometimes even spending  
24 hours here sleeping here in the cemetery 
overnight eating together with a lot of other  
people sharing meals so it's basically 
like a get-together for for everyone
[Music]
and something that is very weird for me that  
I've never seen so far I mean look at 
these Graves they are stacked [Music]
there's a lot of people here somehow reminds me of 
our streets next to our house that's a very Lively
[Music] this is a very Lively Cemetery I 
never thought I would go to a cemetery and  
it would be so Lively so many people so 
many children jumping around here doing  
things and look there's even a jeepney 
inside the cemetery that's freaky [Music]
is
located
foreign
it's very impressive really to see all the family  
coming together without the 
celebration it's beautiful
[Music]
[Music]
have you ever thought you would see something like 
this GG me I'm totally speechless I'm walking like  
I'm walking into a museum literally I have I had 
no idea that is something like this is a good  
thing I cannot I don't have like any I don't know 
what to say honestly I as Michael said we're both  
of us speechless so you haven't seen anything like 
this ever in our lives let's see look at this kid  
he's playing with his uh BB gun in 
between the graves and it's beautiful  
it's so Lively and they're so colorful 
it's more lively than a city it's a  
very urbanized City Center hello how are you 
hello so nice people around here hello hello

Lively it's so colorful it's full of life like 
snacks and drinks and people have a cheerful yeah  
literally inside the the grave people are selling 
snacks and they're I know being cheerful such a  
beautiful example of Life have you ever thought I 
would bring you to a cemetery in GG where people  
are selling snacks inside of a grave and people 
are having fun and I don't know kids are playing  
around in our there's the puppies and puppies are 
sleeping and everything is reliably around here  
beautiful okay I I like this kind 
of thing rather than a very dramatic  
celebration you know yeah like this is 
more yes this is more raw this is more  
authentic this is more I know Lively 
this is like a fresh kind of coat of  
paint here if you've worked before the 
celebration they prepare the tombs okay

second this entire which one first this  
one first and that one the next one okay

but we celebrated on the 1st of November yeah  
so technically tomorrow yes the same happenings 
really similar we go and we put flowers on the

yeah it has shoes or three of them okay  
that's something you don't see every day 
did you okay you can go first you can go  
first you lead the way okay I'm a bit shy you 
know because you there's so many things going  
on here yes little puppies and kittens hello yes 
we've never seen something like this before ever  
we have also something like this in our country 
yes like the Day of the Dead and the celebration  
yeah but not like this and plus this kind of a 
cemetery is very different it's colorful it has  
Graves like this up and down it's like Resort okay 
like a resort interesting okay I never thought  
of a cemetery being a resort oh yellow green um 
everything else do the color mean anything like a  
rainbow okay but does it is it any different if 
there's a pink one and the blue one or a green  
one presentation only half representation only 
okay interesting thank you so much explorers
dodo explorers thank you man thank you man
thank you cousins you're the brother of him wow 
it's a very beautiful memory you have here for him  
in loving memory yes did he used to smoke yeah 
okay okay now I understand we have the cigarettes  
relaxing yeah smoking is relaxing true true 
beautiful thank you guys sorry if I interrupted  
like these friends were gatherers around their 
friend's grave and they brought him secrets  
and like the the candy or for the day that's I 
don't know it's like of course it it gets like  
to you when you're thinking about that because 
it's a celebration for people who are not around  
with you around you anymore so yeah it is 
a beautiful one though but one thing I can  
tell you is that this colorful Graves or I don't 
know how to call them tombstones or I don't know  
shelves on the wall they somehow remind 
me of our merry Cemetery in Romania yeah  
that we have a merry Cemetery in Romania yes so 
the only the the happiest Cemetery they say on  
Earth Happy video somewhere yeah in a way we 
visited that place it's interesting they have  
like uh blue crosses with paintings on them and 
with a funny story of how the person lived it's  
a very I know interesting thing and I thought 
that this is like the only thing in the world  
where cemeteries are painted and colorful 
but apparently here in the Philippines  
it's like that as well okay that's 
something different this is incredible
[Music]
hello hello hello [Music] yes
nice nice treaty thank you thank you  
okay interesting area there's a lot of people 
here thank you man thank you thank you so much  
it's more fun in the Philippines yes definitely 
especially in the cemetery for some reason I would  
have never thought I would say that there's 
more fun in the cemetery but apparently it is
[Music]  
thank you guys thank you so 
much thank you thank you okay  
I never took a picture in a cemetery 
before it's my first time thank you  
this is our YouTube channel yes yes 
I'm a subscriber oh already thank you
yes
I don't know that one man 
we haven't been there yet
soon soon thank you thank you thank you my friend 
you are very nice people DJ one thing I can tell  
you about this place is the fact that this wall 
is very long and I have no idea how to get down  
we got up at some point and now it keeps going 
and going and going and going and going and  
going and there's no way going this wool oh 
I think there's some puppies inside there  
okay interesting oh and there's 
a catch there you go hello Mr Cat  
you are asleep yes you are asleep okay that's 
good every culture deals with that in a unique  
way that reflects their history and beliefs you 
can understand a lot of the culture through this  
celebration and this is exactly what we've tried 
to do this is the lesson so this is the final  
lesson we got to learn out of the experience 
today of all things day this is inevitable but  
you have to make most of your life while 
you're still here you're living it and  
try to think the things that you love all since 
they became in the Roman Catholic Church is a  
way for people to honor their dead and today 
in each country where Roman Catholicism is  
established there are two days dedicated to 
celebrating deceased family members November  
the 1st known as All Saints Day and November II 
All Souls day and originally November the 1st  
was a somber they meant for church attendance 
and participating in prayer for loved ones  
but here is a bit different Filipino culture is 
very family oriented and all seen today it seems  
a holiday tradition together with loved ones who 
are still living and honor and remember those who  
have passed on today's scene is a time to 
celebrate loved ones and remember them as  
if they were feasting and celebrating 
alongside their living family members  
and just like that we have made it to the exit 
somehow yeah oh this goes on and on and on and  
on and on yeah I think it's the whole wall of 
the cemetery surrounding it yes hello what's up
that's good yes okay GG let's go down this way
I mean yeah yeah it's cool that's great 
like this what's your name sir name [Music]
nice to meet you I'm Gigi how are 
you okay nice to meet you Enrique  
okay Gigi it feels literally like we were 
walking on the street I mean if I wouldn't  
have known I would have said that this buildings 
here are houses and that there's some shop around  
here that there's some garages and I would have 
never guessed if I would have never known that  
I'm in a cemetery I would have never guessed 
that I'm in a cemetery actually when we came  
inside there were so many big like I thought 
there were houses or something or like when  
are we going to reach the cemetery and we were 
actually inside yes that's that's interesting  
people here I mean normally when you go to 
cemetery it's a bit gruesome and it's a bit weird  
spooky for westerners yes but here it's I don't 
know it's like you're on the streets of Manila and  
everything is happening normally I know maybe it's 
today that is like this and during the normal year  
it's empty I don't know but it's 
definitely an interesting experience  
I never thought that being inside 
of a cemetery would look like this
interesting I've never seen something like this 
it's like I'm walking down the street inside of  
a village you know hello yeah you have big 
buildings and you have I don't apparently  
like garage area you have shops in my country 
you don't have like this in my country do you  
have like small breaks here and there and that's 
it some people may be coming putting a candle but  
here is like really really irons I know it's 
different that's nice I like the around here
normally is
I know today is awesome today but I 
mean normally during the year yes yes
interesting yeah yeah it's kind of interesting 
people selling the stuff in the cemetery yes so  
colorful great I've never seen something like 
this ever what uh how about the Romania we have  
like small crosses on the side of the road yeah 
on the side and people maybe come and put some  
flowers and some candles it's pretty dramatic 
like we're very dramatic with our celebration
