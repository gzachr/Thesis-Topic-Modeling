if you're planning on traveling to 
the philippines most likely you're  
going to spend some time here in el 
nido palawan so if you are here my 20  
favorite thing to do here in el nido and 
everything you need to know before your visit
okay so mimaropa is composed of 
five different places places and  
but you are here but we're in palawan yeah
but i thought this whole island was called  
palawan oh my god  
and the city name is puerto princesa city
yeah porter princesa 
okay so mima
mi stands for mindoro
oh my god
ma for marinduque and ro for omblon
then pa for palawan
i'm mind blown right now thank 
you for explaining that to me  
first things first if you're planning on getting 
over here to el nido you're most likely going to  
be flying into puerto princesa airport just to 
let you know puerto princesa is about five hours  
driving from el nido that is something 
i did not know before coming here  
but luckily there are vans that'll take you from 
puerto princesa airport all the way over to el  
nido if you go to the luggage area you'll find a 
tourist information desk over there and then you  
could just ask if they can transport you over 
and just note that there are only a couple of  
times a day that the van runs over to el nido 
so you most likely find a van that'll come here  
around the same time you land but when i 
actually came over to puerto princesa i had  
absolutely nothing planned except for my flight 
um i didn't have any hotel booked i didn't have  
a van booked all i knew was that someone 
i met the day before told me about the van  
so i just kind of winged it i'm currently at this 
gas station where i just bought my ticket over to  
el nido it's gonna take about five hours the 
ticket was 700 pesos and i don't know where to  
stay but i'm gonna search it up while we have a 
long drive um i don't know oh the adventures but  
there's about like seven people in the van 
right now and i think it'll be a good drive  
hello from el nido oh my god i just got to el 
nido um and i just checked into this hotel and  
i walked into this hotel asking them if 
they had spare rooms and they luckily did  
so i just checked in um it's like 
seven o'clock right now and i'm still  
i feel like i'm still like 
traveling since we were in the van  
for about six hours um also because we took like a 
30 minute break to stop in the rain and everything  
but i did take like two naps on the van um yes 
through all the curves and bumps and roads but  
el nido has been cool so far just driving through 
the town area it's like a really long street and  
there's a lot of stands and food stands and stores 
around so i'm just gonna go out and walk right now  
uh they said that the beach is about 
five minutes away but honestly this  
hotel room is really nice 
like i really dig the bathroom  
i think i'm going to take some photos here 
tomorrow but just look at this wow it's like  
i feel like i'm in the sauna i was planning on 
actually booking a hotel on the drive to el nido  
but that also didn't happen either because the 
wi-fi and the internet connection was almost  
non-existent so if you're planning on yolo'ing 
like me don't be stressed don't be anxious you  
can do it but i got over to a hotel about 10 
minutes walking away from the main downtown  
area and some guy from my van actually got off 
to the hotel and i just walked in and asked them  
if they had availability and then i ended up 
staying there for about three nights and then  
i moved on over closer to the beach area because 
although it is only a 10 minute walk as a girl  
i didn't really want to walk at night even though 
this town is safe so i ended up moving over to a  
hotel closer and actually right on the beach and i 
have absolutely no complaints about this hotel not  
only is the staff amazing it's an amazing location 
but they also serve you breakfast and you're right  
by the beach so this morning i had a photo shoot 
i ran on the beach today so there's a lot a lot  
of different options hotels and accommodations 
here on the base so if you're just winging like  
me you'll have no problem finding a stay so 
all right let's walk over along this beach  
before it possibly does rain because it's been 
raining here about two times a day minimum at  
least so also another thing too if you're actually 
coming here during rainy season which is between  
may to september expect rainfall at least once 
a day but it's kind of a gamble here you just  
never know but so far over the last four 
days that i've been here it's been raining  
usually in the morning so about like six or seven 
in the morning or around sunset so about five to  
six pm the other thing that i did want to mention 
before going into the things to do here in el nido  
is that when you're around the town area wi-fi 
and data connection isn't always the best  
so on the beach i've actually had the 
most luck getting internet connection  
but some of the smaller streets i haven't had the 
best connection either luckily a lot of the cafes  
and the restaurants do have connection here so 
that's a plus but my first hotel had almost like  
no internet connection and it was really hard to 
do anything and next point before you come here  
just make sure that you have small money don't 
try to bring in like the biggest bills that you  
have because a lot of the places here cannot give 
you change and also the other thing too is that  
there are a lot of atms along the beach 
area but not every atm can give you change  
so actually the atm here was the first atm in the 
philippines where i've gotten 500 peso bills every  
other atm that i've gone to i haven't been able 
to get small money like that but try to exchange  
your money to small money if you're in places 
like manila or bigger cities before coming here  
okay i'm gonna face the other way because the wind 
is just blowing my hair but also if you're here  
during rainy season try to bring a small umbrella 
or a rain jacket because again it rains at least  
once or twice a day luckily i have this small 
little umbrella that fits actually in my fanny  
pack so it hasn't been an issue but again you just 
never know and the good thing is that if it does  
rain during the day it doesn't make for more than 
an hour and it stops so that's good but there's  
been times where it's rained and then an hour 
later it will rain again so just know that now for  
the fun part what to do here in el nido so from my 
last few days here i've come up with 20 things to  
do here in el nido and the first one is obviously 
what i'm doing right now but take a walk along the  
beach i know that might sound basic and obvious to 
you but really take the time to really just walk  
along the entire beach it's really really 
beautiful and you'll be able to find and  
discover a lot of little small shops and stores 
and hotels and maybe even viewpoints that are  
not found commonly on the internet so this morning 
i actually went out for a run and i ran from  
one part of el nido beach to the other and i'm 
like oh my gosh i've been here for a couple of  
days and i've never seen this part of the beach 
and i didn't know this existed so try to really  
take the time to get to know the beach bringing me 
to my next point and the first thing that you've  
probably done the moment you got over to el nido 
is to take all the photos in the world if you are  
visiting during rainy season take your chances and 
take your photos when you can because you never  
know when it's going to rain again it is just 
so beautiful like all the low fog and the clouds  
above the mountains over here ugh i literally 
have no complaints whatsoever so so beautiful  
when i first came to el nido i wasn't really 
totally impressed i'm going to be honest  
with that but i think that's also because i 
came at night i was so tired i had nothing  
planned it was raining almost every day and 
i didn't really actually properly explore  
but when i moved hotels and i 
actually walked around the area  
i've really fallen in love with this place el nido 
has really grown on me and i'm actually really  
sad to leave in a couple of days but i initially 
was planning on staying here for only three days  
and now i'm staying here for a week so if you're 
also planning on visiting you need at least one  
week minimum no matter what you do do not miss 
out on going on tours do not miss out on island  
hopping because that is what el nido is really 
known for when you're here there's going to be  
a lot a lot of tour companies around the downtown 
area and you'll find four different tours you'll  
find tour a tour b tour c and tour d if you've 
been researching and reading online tours a and  
c are the most popular i mean granted the islands 
that they go on are freaking beautiful if you have  
enough time i would recommend going on all the 
tours if i had enough time here i would honestly  
go on every single tour there's so many i think 
there are 35 smaller little islands that surround  
el nido the lowest cost for the tour is 1200 pesos 
and the most expensive is 1400 pesos and obviously  
tour c which is the most popular one and the one 
that's been getting canceled every single day  
since i've been here is the 1400 pesos the reason 
why the tour sea has been getting cancelled is  
because every single morning the coast guard 
informs the entire town if you're able to go  
on certain islands or not for your safety and over 
the last three days because of this rainy season  
um they were saying how it's not entirely safe 
right now to go in tour c so tomorrow is my last  
day where i could potentially go on this tour 
so we'll see if i actually go on but i also note  
that when you are going on these tours that you're 
gonna have to pay for a lot of things so if you're  
planning on snorkeling there's a snorkeling fee 
if you're planning on renting out water shoes you  
gotta pay for water shoes if you're planning on 
renting a kayak that's about 200 pesos in the blue  
lagoon so there's a lot of fees and there's also 
an entrance and environmental fee as well and you  
pay that once even though the cost of the actual 
tour itself might be 12 or 1400 dollars expect to  
pay at least another 400 pesos more for all of the 
other rental fees i went on my tours with hello  
el nido and they took amazing care of me and they 
also have a laundromat here in downtown el nido as  
well so if you need to do your laundry after your 
tour i would just go there and there's a huge sign  
in the middle of downtown you can't miss it so you 
want to note that when you're going on these tours  
you will also probably want to buy a dry bag as 
well and a waterproof phone case so all around  
the town you'll find people selling them if you're 
bringing a phone important valuable as a camera  
i highly recommend you buying one of these dry 
bags for your safety hey all right we're all going  
on tour a and we got super lucky because we are 
on a private boat but this is not a private tour  
so that leads me to my next point yes all 
these islands are amazing and they're beautiful  
but if you're here in el nido for just a 
limited amount of time you want to go visit  
the most popular and one of the most beautiful 
the big lagoon so yes the big lagoon is really  
worth the hype and it is really worth it if you 
have a drone so when i went we got really really  
lucky that it didn't rain at all and there was 
a little like orange platform area in the middle  
of the water and i just kayaked there by myself 
threw up the drone and i got my footage so  
bring a drone if you can but take your pictures 
there as well it is really worth it and beautiful  
and that is under tour a so the town actually 
kind of does it really smart well they'll break  
up the most popular places and different type of 
tours number five you want to go to las cabanas  
beach to see sunset and yes although that it's 
been raining here during sunset every single day  
it only rains for about like an hour max when 
i actually went over to las cabanas beach the  
moment i got there started raining wow the rain 
here is so quick i just got to las cabanas beach  
and i wanted to shoot sunset here but the 
moment i got here started to rain so then i  
just went back to call my tricycle driver again 
to drive him back to my hotel but i waited like  
it couldn't have been more than 15 minutes 
and now the rain stopped that was so fast and  
i still have about five minutes i see color in 
the sky to take photos of sunset i'm so excited  
another beach that i highly do recommend 
going on is the seven commandos beach and  
that is actually under tour a as well it was 
just like a nice relaxing area there too so  
all of the tours they actually end up the tours 
there and then everyone kind of just like chills  
relaxes plays volleyball and it's really a nice 
time but don't be like me and just bring one  
drone battery because i only had like five 
minutes to fly my drone before it came back down  
when you're walking outside of the 
downtown area you might get to the beach  
and go like okay should i turn 
left or should turn right so  
when i first got here i actually turned 
right and the right side has a lot of bars  
and restaurants so if you want to drink spend the 
night i would recommend going to the right side
if you're feeling really spontaneous 
on your first night like me  
you can come over to the tribukuridas bar 
so i actually got a tattoo my first night  
here it was the most spontaneous thing that 
i've done oh my god i'm getting a tattoo
this is really yolo but if you're not so 
spontaneous like me you can opt in for a henna  
tattoo alrighty next when you're here i highly 
recommend you taking the time to walk around the  
town area and yes it is a small town area where 
you can walk everywhere in less than five minutes  
or if you're taking your time more than five 
minutes but when i actually first got here  
i only walked around rizal street and i didn't 
really know that the smaller streets had a lot  
of things so for the first couple of days i was 
only walking on rizal and when i moved hotels i  
was like oh my gosh this place existed i had 
no idea when you're here you're also going  
to be asked a lot to ride tricycles if you're not 
familiar with a motorbike yes you do want to take  
the tricycles here and they're not too expensive 
either thank you ino for picking me up whenever i  
texted you thank you salamat po bye you also 
find a lot of places renting out motorbikes as  
well and they're relatively cheap you'll find 
them for about 400 pesos per day um and i think  
there's a lot of supply here because in almost 
every other corner i've seen tour companies  
and motorbike rental companies because there are 
so many motorbike companies and motorbikes around  
the area if you know how to ride one i would 
highly recommend renting out a motorbike and  
driving around the island the beaches and explore 
more of the area look and just here there's so  
many but if you're within the downtown area you 
don't really need to take a tricycle anywhere  
if you're okay to walk nothing is more than 10 
minutes walking 10 minutes will take you all the  
way up to the el nido public market so this market 
is outside of the downtown area but you'll find  
some of the freshest fruit they sell everything 
from dragon fruit to mangoes literally some of  
the best mangoes i've had in my life watermelons 
all the fruits that you can really find out here
as you're heading over to the beach the last right 
exit before the beach during the street i don't  
know what the street is actually called on google 
maps it's c dot hama but here is where you'll find  
a lot of stores restaurants a lot of western 
food out here so this street again i had no  
idea this existed until yesterday or two days ago 
but this has been one of my favorite streets here  
in el nido this is also where you'll go bar 
hopping if you're planning going bar hopping  
so to my next point the other thing you want 
to do here in el nido is to go bar hopping  
and you're probably familiar with sava a beach 
bar that i actually haven't gone to because  
i've just had no energy to want to socialize 
and drink but maybe i'll walk in right now
are you open are you open oh we're open 
at 4pm madam 4pm all right guys 4 p.m  
and then what time do you close just every 
2 a.m 2 a.m and this is the most popular  
bar here it's the most popular bar here ma'am 
and every night there's a party here ma'am party  
every night's a party ah okay like only on 
the weekend or just every night every day  
yeah every every night every night we have dj here 
dj okay maybe i have to come here tonight okay  
thank you yeah maybe i'll come here 
later tonight i haven't come here yet so  
i don't know honestly ever since i started 
traveling i've just been getting really really  
tired and i haven't been going out and drinking 
out as much as i used to all of my drinking energy  
has correlated over to my travel energy this is 
another one that i don't know if i can recommend  
because i haven't done it yet but if you want to 
you could rent out a kayak here and go kayaking  
on tour a i did go kayaking so i did that but if 
you're feeling more watery and adventurous you  
can rent out a kayak here as well if you've been 
traveling in southeast asia for quite some time  
you'll notice that in every country you'll find a 
lot of massage places and the other day i actually  
opted in for a massage instead of going out to 
the bars but the massages here are so far the  
one that i got was really good they will cost 
you an average 500 to 600 pesos and then after  
massage right across the street there is ice 
cream so i actually haven't found a lot of ice  
cream stores here in philippines so when i saw 
that this one was here it's homemade ice cream  
i was like i have to go so i got one and actually 
i asked to use the bathroom and then they told me  
to go upstairs and when i went upstairs it was a 
bar so this is ice cream plus bar hey what's up
thank you can i try a jam can 
i try the pineapple ginger rum  
this one sounds interesting i've been having 
a lot of pineapple here in el nido and i love  
ginger so that almost sounds 
like the perfect mix thank you
it smells smells like pineapple
oh this is really good
and you just put this on like bread 
i'm sorry do you just put this on bread  
or something no what do you usually put this 
in actually you can put this on bread this  
possible oh bread putting this on bread 
oh bread is possible this is really good
do you also use this for tea or no yes you 
do can i get the pineapple ginger please
a small one is okay yeah thank you 
this is really good i need to get this
alrighty i'm so happy i got this oh my gosh all 
right the other thing too again when i travel  
it's actually kind of hard sometimes because 
there's a lot of times where i want to buy things  
but because i have such limited space in my 
luggage i have to control myself and what i buy  
but i told myself that whatever the 
last country is that i'm gonna go crazy
if you're walking the block right next to 
the beach it's also a one-way so if you're  
walking on the actual street itself 
and you don't want to get hit by a car  
you don't have to worry about the 
other way it's really a one-way street  
here and then that intersection right there 
it splits off if you're planning on visiting  
el nido and let's just say that you need to 
work and you just need good wi-fi there are  
a couple of cafes and restaurants along rizal 
street that'll have good wi-fi my favorite one  
that i've been going to is called taste cafe and 
they have amazing amazing acai bowls good wi-fi  
really friendly staff and it's kind of in 
the center of everything i actually had an  
acai bowl today earlier before i made this 
video so i'm gonna go in and say hi to them
okay and this is the interior of taste
they also have an upstairs seating area 
and i was sitting right there doing work
i know i just want to uh say that you guys have  
really good acai bowls no really and good wi-fi 
too yeah well maybe i'll be back again bye bye
all right
so yes and the other good thing too is that 
they close at 9pm what cafe closes at 9pm and  
then if you cross the street you'll head over 
to the infamous el nido bakery here is where  
you'll also find the infamous pandecoco i came 
earlier today but they started making them at two  
hi do you guys have the pandecoco yes 
yay all right so what what exactly  
is pandecoco because i had it the other day it was 
really good but i don't remember what is inside
coconut buko yes buko and you guys make it fresh 
every day fresh every day so all the pastries  
and the bread that they have here it's freshly 
made every single morning okay i will take one
yes only one should i get more should i 
get two the egg tart was really good too  
i'll take two of these usually what time do  
they run out usually what time do they run out
what time and then what time do you usually finish
so all of this is gone in two hours two hours 
so if you're here come between two and four  
and cross your fingers that you'll be lucky and 
get yourself a pandecoco oh they just made more  
so i got two but each of them only cost 15
pesos so inside is coconut shaved 
coconut buko oh and it's so fresh
originally when i said i only wanted 
one the girl laughed and was like  
only one what else so i end up getting two but 
it's because i know that i'll eat everything  
i'm trying to self-control how much i eat 
but i'll probably eat it all it's really  
good so el nido bakery must and again since 
the town is really small you'll kind of find  
a lot of these places just right next to each 
other and it's super close walking distance
the next popular thing that you want to do is 
come over here to the canopy walk the entrance  
fee is 30 pesos but the ticket price is 400 
pesos and there are two different options  
you got the dream catcher and the regular canopy 
walk and the just the canopy walk itself is 400.  
how much is a dream catcher same but together 
how much 730. okay so if you do both together 730  
but they're just two different walks and i 
just paid for the regular canopy walk and  
that's going to take about half an hour or 
so so i think i'm the only am i the only one  
no i think someone's waiting for me oh yay 
okay okay all right so let me put this on
you gotta put these harnesses on so you don't 
fall into the canopy walk we go so this is the  
start of the walk this is a little bit of a hike 
up five minutes to the top yeah five minutes ten  
all right we got this oh metal
whoa
whoa canopy walk
oh my gosh whoa it's a little bit wobbly
be careful when you're here oh my god it's 
like what do i hold on to the railing or  
just uh oh okay okay cool 
so we're going up there holy  
if you're scared of heights 
don't worry the railings got you  
ah these are limestone apparently 
these limestone rocks grow  
one centimeter every year and 
these holes are actually raindrops  
but because it rains through so often you said 
it brings it down yeah brings it down but wait  
so are all these mountains made out of limestone 
yes oh my god all of them limestone so cool cool
made it to the top of the canopy walk the views 
are absolutely stunning why do you need a drone  
when you can come up to the canopy walk so this 
mountain is the tallest mountain in el nido and  
with one of the tours you can actually get over 
to the beach which tour is that do you know
yeah super nice i can just stay here all 
day but unfortunately they close at four  
you guys close at four o'clock 
so i just caught it in time  
i think they made that stand for the tour 
guides to take photos i'm smart the mark  
actually grew up here in el nido and i asked 
him how long the building's been here for  
so last 10 years you said last 10 years they just 
started developing but he was saying that there  
were mainly cottages and palm trees here and now 
you can't really see a lot of palm trees now it's  
just a lot of buildings local people still live 
on the beach or they live elsewhere now they also  
live on the beach they move to other place is it 
because they got kicked out or they want to they  
want to they don't like the tourists? yeah no they 
like the tourists but they quiet yeah like that  
quiet wow so el nido really the town area 
has been here for not even 10 years yeah  
crazy wow and it's really just right next to all 
the most beautiful islands here in the philippines  
wow we are the last ones here it's currently 
4:20pm waiting for golden hour which is probably  
not going to happen but so one thing that i was 
going to recommend to do in el nido is to hike  
taraw cliff but since april 26th, 2022 they were 
closed and it's really unfortunate especially  
for the tour guides so mark actually was a tour 
guide for the taraw cliff but it's closed, why? 
there's a lot of reasons there's no safety gear 
nothing it's very dangerous too as long as you  
don't have a fear of heights you can do it wow 
so safety gear that's really important because  
apparently there were a lot of accidents yeah that 
happened up there but there's also the el nido  
bird that lives on top of the cliff yes and 
that's actually where el nido got its name from  
so el nido in spanish means nest oh my god so 
guys if you're curious as to how el nino got  
it's name it's because of that bird and behind 
all of these mountains there are actually caves  
with the el nido birds and they just want to i 
guess preserve the nature and the animals so hence  
why it's closed but there's also another airport 
here called swift airswift airport because those  
birds are called swiftlet birds mind blows so if 
you guys are wondering that is why somewhere over  
there i think it's like less than five kilometers 
away because yeah because i couldn't fly my drone  
but that's why wow we just had an entire history 
lesson of el nido what i also find cool is that  
this town area it's only been pretty active with 
visitors for only 13 years it was rated the number  
one city to visit across the seven wonders of 
the world and i guess that's good and bad for the  
local people here i think mark finds it both good 
and bad yeah for obvious reasons i think you guys  
may or may not know but in the next five years i 
could only only imagine el nido being two times  
more busier than it is right now and i came maybe 
like three months after it opened up back up after  
the pandemic and there's still a good amount of 
tourists out here but i can just imagine what  
it's like in the next five years but it's crazy 
to see kind of like a bird's eye view an el nido  
eye view over here to see how many boats 
that there are there's so many i feel like  
when you're down there on the beach you don't 
realize how many boats are here but when you're  
up here you can see really everything it's like 
a panoramic view so guys if you guys are visiting  
el nido you have to come to the canopy walk 
really i'm loving this this is totally worth it
so if you have rented a motorbike you're 
probably going to want to make your way over to  
nacpan beach so earl graciously offered me hey 
guys offered to drive me over to nacpan beach  
and he actually works at one of the 
restaurants along the beach in el nido beach  
and he was like have you gone to nacpan and i 
was like no and he's like i'll take you there  
so he graciously picked me up at he came at like 
4:50am in the morning i woke up at 4:40am guys um  
but he drove here it takes about 40 minutes to get 
here so yeah it's a really beautiful beach we're  
on the back side of the beach and we're about to 
head over to the front but if you just want to get  
away from el nido beach or explore more of the 
area honestly this is the beach to come to and  
if you have a drone come with a drone 
because it is absolutely stunning from above
so if you're heading your way back down to el 
nido beach from nacpan beach you might want to  
stop over at lio beach i think the stores are 
still opening up but there's a lot a lot of  
cute little chic stores and restaurants over here 
beach is really nice so far i mean like all the  
stores and restaurants you have all the trees out 
here i kind of wish they were open so i could sit  
down and eat at one of the restaurants but for 
now we're just gonna walk around onto the beach  
and see what else is here overall guys these were 
my 20 things to do here in el nido and all of my  
travel tips that i've kind of gathered during 
my couple of days that have been here so far
