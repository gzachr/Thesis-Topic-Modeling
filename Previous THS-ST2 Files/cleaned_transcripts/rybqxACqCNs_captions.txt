this is just silly law number six
so let's get started shall we
what is the driving with the defective
taillight penalty the defective tail
light penalty can really hurt your
wallet

philippines that's driving with a
defective winds windscreen windshield
do we know any american living in the
philippines who was previously or is
still now driving and filming from a
vehicle that has had or has defective
steering
risking the safety of himself other road
users and pedestrians
by his own words saying the vehicle is
dangerous as it just threw him over the
other side of the road into oncoming
traffic
do we know that the vehicle has been
fixed
do we have absolute proof a vehicle is
driving in the taliban area with a
defective windshield
you bet we do
and that is the video it's raining
clouds
do we have absolute proof a vehicle was
being driven in the taliban area with a
defective steering you bet we do
and the video was a dangerous steering
problem with the white van
the video a dangerous steering problem
with the white van is just a double
whammy as it breaks not one but two
local laws of the philippines meaning
brian smith could be fined twice for
breaking two separate laws
do we have the contact details of the
local land transportation office to
report an american driving a defective
and dangerous vehicle in and around the
area of taliban behold

the boss there
so we'll post this on expat so you can
see it so again folks
what example is is the foreigner giving
to the locals and other foreigners
looking to move into the area on how to
conduct themselves in a law-abiding way
what person would publish your own
crimes onto a worldwide forum like
youtube
please note
if you are a youtuber then your class is
a public figure
especially given the fact that so many
people watch the channel every month
you are owed them to open to criticism
if you are a public figure many of the
people are living abroad are wishing to
follow in the steps of this public
figure and that's what he's promoting as
well so brian smith has said on many
occasions that young children watch his
videos
what kind of example is he setting to
those young children about it being a
responsible adult in the real world
now we will post this to uh expats
forums and as the two videos concerned
but the list of infractions that this
guy is racking up
okay in videos showing a worldwide forum
that he just doesn't care a damn about
the philippines laws
at all or the philippines people
by driving these defective dangerous
vehicles all over the place that in his
own words i've just been thrown onto the
other side of the road because the
steering's defective
we've never seen it being fixed we've
never heard of it being fixed and he's
still driving it around
and now it's got a busted windscreen as
well
and he's admitted that for the last
several weeks he's been driving around
while it's on a flat tyre which would
cause the damn thing to
you know i mean this guy
for someone who spent a number of years
in the motor trade
and knows how dangerous
what he's doing
the guy just doesn't care about anything
and anybody but himself
honestly ladies and gentlemen it's
amazing anyway please like comment share

and we will catch you next time which in
fact is going to be very shortly thank
