what should you get a jollibee for your
first time jollibee is a filipino fast
food chain that specializes in fried
chicken called chicken joy
it's my favorite fried chicken i don't
think you can change my mind first time
you come here just go for the spicy
chicken joy with rice and gravy
they used to only have non-spicy chicken
joy but the spicy one is so much more
flavorful
eat the chicken with a gravy or you can
pour the gravy into the rice
or if you're like my dad you can eat the
gravy straight up
i can't i can't do that also this was my
first time trying their chicken sandwich
because doug really wanted to try it
it's delicious i'd absolutely get it
again i've never had popeye's chicken
sandwich but doug has
and this is how he feels about it when
you come back see if you like the
palabro noodles or filipino spaghetti
with your chicken joy fyi the spaghetti
is way sweeter than the spaghetti you
may be used to
for dessert you can try their peach
mango pie but honestly i prefer the
banana jackfruit pie so those are great
dishes to start with
after those try the other things on
their menu and let me know how you like
them
