okay guys so
now let's start the plating of the bilal
and so the chef has already put
the chicken wings on the plate and now
she's putting the butter
so for those of you who don't know what
bilal is below is something like a
platter which has everything in it
am i correct so she's putting
butter like generously on it
then they're going to put the dressing
and for this the dressing was
parmesan so
and this is the lemon and the pepper so
as i've been told earlier that for each
below you can choose two flavors
so the customer was ordered this one has
ordered
two flavors that is the garlic sorry so
that's the parmesan and the
lemon and pepper and that's i think
parsley so see i'm
myself a chef of half so let's see the
next part
whether you do the partition in the
video in the
in the plate in the platter of this
so as you can see in this video that
they're going to put a lot of things
so now i think they're going to put
boiled brinjals eggplant
so those of the indians who are watching
this they're thinking what is this
it's a filipino
staple do you call it tortang
it's a part of the salad so they've put
that
they're putting the red onions
tomato
and then the delicacy that's a salted
egg
so as you can see the salted egg is
having the
color of the yolk which is being changed
into dark yellow
or orange as it's being processed
for a long period of time it's a
delicacy which i am telling you it's a
must try
if you want to try it alone you can go
to bunker one and get it
from there now the next part they're
going to plate
i think lumpia or something they're
going to plate lumpia
and the lumpia is having the filling of
pork so
those of you want to try lumpia the
original in-house lumpy of wild wings
they can try it
so this is a medium-sized
pillow this is the smallest size
so as you can see guys in the smallest
size there is so much food so just
imagine how much will be there in the
biggest size
don't worry if you can't imagine i will
be putting a picture of that
and then you can see the size comparison
so everything is being counted twice
so now the next part that's the b horn
so those who are thinking that what is
bihar
so bihar is uh filipino vermicelli
noodles so
that's been cooked with pork and
vegetables
and now they're going to put that into
the platter
so how much people how many people can
eat this
small one so it's good for four to five
people
and guys now the plate is being covered
in foil but if you could i could show
you the plate before it was
made it is made up of bamboo so
it's not harming the environment it's
not made up of plastic so you can use it
later also for making
cmi if you want in the house
for those of you don't know come on it's
filipino momos
with less coating more meat so
the smell of the bee horn is making me
irresistible to try it
and now they're going to put the
dressing of bihon that is made up of
cabbage carrot chicken
and if you want you can put tomas or the
anything on that if you want at your
house
so the last thing which is going on this
is
[Music]
the shrimp so guys just to let you know
that i will not be tasting the whole
bilal so that
it's a lot of food i will be trying some
part of it
in a separate dish in a separate plate
so this is the shrimp piece so the
shrimpies are being made
by uh
frying them somehow in the pan firstly
by boiling and then by
sauteing them in the pan
so those of you who love seafood they
would love to see this scene right now
of shrimpies
i think it's made up of garlic yeah
it's sorted with garlic yeah so there's
something still left guys i don't know
what it is
they're going to surprise now so
still more garlic is going on so those
of you who love
the dragon breath smell of garlic
and along with this they'll be even
giving you dipping sauce i think
some dipping sauce so that you can dip
your things in that
only the food nothing else don't take it
to the wrong way
[Music]
so now came the lechon
so what is this called lechon
yeah the lecture on roll and as i've
been told earlier that the lechon roll
is
boneless so we don't have to do the hard
work of taking out the bones
and how many kilos is this one it's
one kilo and i'm sure
it's difficult to finish and it looks so
nice
so now the dipping sauces are coming the
vinegar and the monk tomas sauce
and now the plating is done so now they
will be covering it up and they will be
dispatching it thank you guys so stay
connected bye bye
okay guys so we are the last stage of
our video that's the tasting version of
the mini
platter of bilal so only one thing is
missing in this that's a leech on roll
and that's a very big thing and i don't
want to try that
so just to let you know what it will
taste like i know that
it will be tasting like crunchy
country pork it is very delicious
if it's three or four people of you you
can order one roll from
kai from wild wings but it's since
it's just me and my cameraman named so
i don't want to waste the electron roll
so let's try the rest of the things the
rest of the things are the
bihon the lumpia the shrimp piece the
salted egg
the salad and the dipping sauce so let's
start this video by using the
by tasting the lumpia so the lump is
made up of pork
and i have been told that i can dip it
in the
sauces so we have the gravy vinegar
we have the ketchup and my favorite
ranch
so i'll be dipping into the ranch
obviously
the lumpia is having the density of the
pore
it's not that spicy so if you want to
have the spicy one you can check my
instagram and then
go and order the chili gourmet spice
thing thing
from wheat so if you want you you can
get it from them
and even kai at while drinks about they
have the dipping sauce of the
spicy thing so if you want you can dip
it with that so
instead of half lump here left i'll be
dipping into the gravy and let's see if
this any different flavor
[Music]
according to me still lumpia with the
ranch is the best
so let's proceed to the next part of the
video
in this plate as you can see
it's having bihon so for those of you
who are thinking what bihorn is
so bihar is the filipino vermicelli
noodles
and which are being cooked with chicken
and vegetables
and with some amount of soy sauce so
let's try bihon
have eaten me on a lot of times before
also so
this is the same type but the
dressing which kai has made for the
bihon which is made up of chicken
so as you can see in the video also
there's still
some chicken on this pihan so this
chicken is so tender
that it just melts in the mouth so if
you want to try
some more different type of bihan you
can ask kai
and but i'm so sorry that this platter
which we showed you earlier which i'm
racing right now
it's only for a limited time offer so
maybe next christmas season or
maybe next new year you can order that
so
now we have this the salad and then that
we have the red onions the tomato and
the salted egg
so i will be tasting the salted deck for
all of you picking one for the team
i've tasted solid egg before also i love
it
it's having a different texture it's
having different flavor
then the other things which you can
taste in the market
so you can take it in your hand and eat
it directly
if you love to eat savory things
it is for you i will just flush down
everything
down
it's such a strong flavor of salted egg
it's processed for around still where i
remember it's processed for around 15 to
20 days
so that gives it a different texture and
different flavor
so we have the last part of this video
in which i'll be trying the shrimp piece
which have been
sauteed with the garlic so as you can
see the head is still on
and for those of you who don't know how
to eat a shrimpy i'll be
doing it now for you if you want you can
remove the head
and then eat it like this but i don't
like to eat the
shell also of the back tail so i'll be
removing that
but since it has been cooked in the
