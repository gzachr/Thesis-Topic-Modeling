Hi guys, this is Kelly.
Welcome back to my channel~
Today, as said in the previous video,
I'll be reacting to the Filipino male celebrities.
Let's get started!!!
Like the previous video,
Judy prepared this.
So I don't know who's in this round.
So there are 16 Filipino male celebrities.
From the start James Reid and Jameson Blake.
OH well, I never heard of Jameson Blake.
But he looks very handsome.
So, you know, I like James Reid..
So, let me pick one.
AND I pick James Reid.
HUH? I didn't event press yet but..
Tom Rodriguez and Richard G..Gue..
Sorry. I don't know how to pronounce this surname.
But I've heard of Richard.
And, I pick Richard because he looks cuter.
He has very small face and his eyes are very sharp.
So I think I'm more appealed to Richard.
(Next round is) Enrique Gil...
????
Why is there 'also' (beside the name)?
You just copied and pasted from someone. LOL
So it's either Enrique Gil or Joshua Garcia.
OMG! And you know what?!?!
Enrique looks naughty but Joshua looks so cute.
Okay, I'll pick Joshua.
I like his smile.
Markus Paterson vs. Ronnie Alonte
Why is Ronnie's hair so short.
Markus isn't looking.. Isn't the front shot.
It's like the side shot.
They look similar.
Are they like cousins?
OMG is it just my eyes?
Judy: LOL
They look similar.
Well, you know I go for Ronnie
because he looks fine
despite having almost like a military kind of shaved hair.
Ronnie Alonte!
Next.
Alden Richards vs. Paulo avelino.
Oh my gosh, you know?!?!?!?!
Alden looks like the guy awhile ago.
The other guy... What was his name?
Okay, so Alvin.
Is Alvin the guy from "Hello, Love, Goodbye?"
Am I right?
Please come down if I am right.
Next.
Tony..
(trying to read the name)
Oh my gosh.
Neither of service my type...
Okay, so it's Tony!
WOW
Daniel Padilla vs. Gab Lagman
Why is Gab not wearing something?
It's open.
Judy why..
Judy?
Why did you get this picture?
You should be fair.
If Gab is not wearing then Daniel should also not..
Well, you know..
I like Daniel because like I heard is Christian and all,,
and I really ship (support) Kathniel.
Oh my gosh..
I don't... didn't know Gab but he looks so...
.....handsome....
Oh my Gosh!!!
Okay, so if I win, we will go for Daniel.
If you win Judy, we'll take Gab.
Bata-Bato-Pick!
Oh, you might be wondering,
if I liked Daniel, I could have just picked him.
But I also wanted to pick Gab that's why we did "bato-bato-pick"
So, next is..
Bret Jackson vs. Joao Constancia
You know what I go for Bret.
He looks cute.
that
(this face in the picture)
look is so cute.
This is top 8 male celebrities.
Let's get going.
The first round is Tony and Daniel.
And of course, awhile ago, Tony reached this round
because I close my eyes and picked one.
So it's Daniel.
Yeah, this guy!!! Joshua Garcia.
He looks similar to Alden Richards a while ago.
PREVIOUSLY SAID
You know, Richard.
He's handsome.
Like he has that very man-like looking.
But Joshua has that cute face.
But I think I'll go for Richard.
HEHEHEHE
He's so handsome hehe
James Reid vs. Ronnie Alone
So, James.
Was that so quick?
Alden Richards vs. Bret Jackson
You know, I don't know who Brett Jackson is, but he looks cute.
So I'll go for Bret.
This is Top 4 male actors (celebrities).
So I know who are in here.
And the first round is Bret Jackson versus Richard.
(Can't pick one)
You know from the previous video, I can't stop saying OMG.
because it's really hard.
Like it's really really really hard.
It's like Mom vs. Dad.
Judy..
If you were me who would you pick?
A cute guy? Or a handsome guy?
Judy: I prefer handsome.
You prefer handsome?
Well, I prefer handsome.
So, Richard!!
James Reid vs. Daniel Padilla
So this is the Top of Top.
Guys... Whom should I pick?
Before I shipped for Kathniel,
I was really big fan of Jadine.
Like I started liking Filipino actors and actresses
watching "On the Wings of Love (OTWOL)."
And I used to sing On the Wings of Love (the song), every day.
This is somewhat like your ex vs. your new crush.
So, you know past is in the past.
We have to move on.
So, I pick Daniel Padilla â™¥
And,,, This is the finals.
Richard vs. Daniel
Well, but I think the answer is given.
I pick Daniel.
YAY
The winner is Daniel Padilla!!
This is it for today's video.
