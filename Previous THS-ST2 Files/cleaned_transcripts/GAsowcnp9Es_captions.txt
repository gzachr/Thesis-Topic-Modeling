Can you notice someone like me?
Even from just the corners of your eyes
Can you catch me glancing at you?
Even if I'm not the one infront of you
Oh, Chinito
Someday you'll know
And if you find this amusing
Can you still see me?
When I talk to you I forget how I look
I hope you'll listen to me
To clear up your mind
Because you've caught my eyes and feelings
Oh, Chinito, Chinito
If you're not sleepy
If you're not blinded
I just want to know if I still have a chance
Why is the color of your world?
I can carry home just one smile from you
Oh, Chinito
Someday you'll know
And if you find this amusing
Can you still see me?
When I talk to you I forget how I look
I hope you'll listen to me
To clear up your mind
Because you've caught my eyes and feelings
Oh, Chinito, Chinito
I hope you'll listen to me
To clear up your mind
Because you've caught my eyes and feelings
Ah, please stop laughing
Can you still see me?
When I talk to you I forget how I look
I hope you'll listen to me
To clear up your mind
Because you've caught my eyes and feelings
Oh, Chinito, Chinito
