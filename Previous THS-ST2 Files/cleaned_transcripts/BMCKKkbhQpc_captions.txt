This is my son's passport.
It will be expired soon, next month.
So I decided to renew his passport.
I think it's time to prepare "post corona".
I think the time is coming soon.
Everything must be prepared to take a quick action. 
So I am going to the city hall right now.
And I will show you the process how I renew the passport.
I don't like to compare the processes
between Philippines and Korea.
I am not interested in such a topic anymore.
I just want to focus on going to the Philippines.
No matter what.
I am just no one.
How can I change something (relating this issue).
I will just do the best thing what I can do at the moment.
