KILLED IN THE PHILIPPINES’ DRUG WAR
Mr. President, my child, she was a good child. She wasn’t …
The only mistake she made was to sell [drugs], but only so we could have food on our table.
'Ron-Ron “Heart” De Chavez, a 26-year-old transgender woman, sold drugs to support her family.
This is my child who took care of us even if she knew what she was doing was wrong.
I wish you could understand how we live.
Because we really don’t have a source of income since my husband died.
So it was just Ron-Ron who supported us and fed us.
On January 7, 2017 police detained Heart and accused her of dealing drugs.
Her family had to pay a bribe for her release.
Three days later, seven masked gunmen dragged Heart from her home and executed her on the street.
I saw my child sprawled on the ground. I embraced her.
There was no life in her anymore.
Can you believe she was hit here by a .45 caliber and it went out through here?
Is that it? Is this what Duterte’s administration is all about?
To kill the poor? Is this why we elected him?
They kill people like chickens.
More than 3,600 people have been killed by unidentified masked gunmen since President Rodrigo Duterte took office.
Some of the masked gunmen are police officers in disguise, or hitmen working closely with the police.
