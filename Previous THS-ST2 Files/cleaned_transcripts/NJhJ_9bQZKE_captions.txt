No! I wasn't ready! oh, she's giving me a 
heart palpitations! Today we are checking out  
Asia's phoenix, the amazing Morissette. I have 
reacted to her before but this is my first time  
checking out this performance which is really 
one of the most iconic. This is a channel where  
fellow singers and music enthusiasts alike 
check out some of our favorite artists  
so we can just learn from our 
faves. let's dive right in!
so beautiful love her
wish 1075
her control and i've said this before is just  
so good ah there's a sweetness there's 
a softness ah just the subtlety and that  
softness and sustaining that volume and that 
emotion can be really tricky and she doesn't  
even flinch i mean she's so relaxed and has 
such a beautiful smile and these great teeth
we're going to listen to that whole chorus 
but let me hear that one more time first  
of all these lyrics are beautiful so 
akin kanalang is translates to please  
be mine at least according to this 
caption and that cry that she does
you heard it oh it's so beautiful that little 
crack cry honestly i don't even i'm not entirely  
sure how she does that will you teach it to me 
please because i i love that it's like right  
on the edge there where there's a little bit 
of fry i can't even that cry is so gorgeous
me
there's that control
yes so right here when she takes it to head voice 
that's a beautiful little transition do you see  
how that little addition of texture just gives it 
so much dynamics and so much emotion right here
bc that's so nice right there 
so i bet she's gonna yeah that's  
well in her belt range she's gonna go for that
gorgeous
my i love there's just it's 
sometimes so completely pure  
and then adds this little bit 
of dirt and it's ah beautiful
no i wasn't ready okay i knew the bridge was gonna 
build up of course obviously but i thought we were  
gonna go into like a power note she's giving me 
a whistle tone already in the bridge she didn't  
even wait for the last chorus that wasn't even 
fair you give me oh give me heart palpitations
yes
oh
okay there's no good place to pause there 
because it's just i don't want to interrupt  
anything she is executing on such a brilliant 
level and i remember seeing another wish bus  
performance and this one in particular i 
don't know how far apart they were she is so  
relaxed and it is stunning to watch because it's 
really like watching an athlete do their thing  
right there's growls cries 
emotion but it's all controlled
wish 107.5.
for good measure i'll give you that 
e oh my goodness if you want more

my shoulder i appreciate you all so much
