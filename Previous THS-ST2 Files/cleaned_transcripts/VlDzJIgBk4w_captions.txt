So we just arrived here at the Pacific Mall,
and we're going to have some lunch here in this place called 1st Colonial Grill.
The home of Sili ice cream.
I hope I pronounced that right.
So let's try some of the famous chili ice cream here,
and of course, the Bicol Express!
Yummy.
So we're seated here at the 1st Colonial Grill,
and I'm so excited even Mads is.
Look, her checking out the menu,
- Yes.
in a very orthodox way.
So I will pick the Bicol Express.
I think it will be amazing,
and what did you order?
- This one. 
This one?
The fried rice which will be nice.
- and also this one.
Kandingga.
Bicol's own version of Bopis.
What is Bopis?
- They said it is a best seller.
Yeah, and I will have a melon shake as well.
And like I said before,
it's the home of the Sili ice cream,
so like you can see, they have it in four different levels:
level one, level two, level three, and volcano level.
It's actually spicy ice cream.
Mads, you took level two, right?
Yeah, they said it's mildly spicy.
And of course, you know me.
I go volcano, I'm going to erupt like the Mayon volcano here.
But it will be delicious.
I know that for sure.
Look at this, guys.
My melon shake has arrived.
It even has small marshmallows.
So cute.
Let's taste it.
This is delicious,
so refreshing.
Yeah, they really know how to make a melon shake here in 1st Colonial.
- How is it?
It's very good, very refreshing.
- Rate one to ten.
It's a really good shake,
so I would say a nine,
It's actually so good that I will keep this one all to myself,
and I'm not going to let you try it.
- Okay.
I know I'm so mean sometimes.
But nobody gets my shake and my food.
So my main dish has arrived, guys:
The Bicol Express, juicy pork cooked in coconut juice,
with some peppers, and it's really, really nice.
I think...
I've got to take a piece of pork with the pepper.
Oh, my God.
And it's spicy.
So good.
Oh my God.
Yeah, maybe this is my new favorite dish in the Philippines.
I love sisig, but I also love spicy food,
This is really good.
So juicy with the sauce,
The spiciness of the peppers.
Amazing!
Yeah, if you like spicy food and you're here in Legazpi or the Bicol area,
try this Bicol Express.
Amazing.
And what we got here, Mads?
- Kandingga.
And what is inside?
- Meat.
But what is the meat?
Is it like liver or something, or kidneys?
- Kidney or liver, you will try it.
So you order something, Mads, and you don't even know what it is.
Okay, but I will try.
- I think you will love it.
Mmmm.
It's really nice too.
Yeah, I think it's something like kidneys or something I don't know.
or liver maybe?
Yeah, that's also nice.
Very nicely spiced.
So I actually looked up this dish,
and it seems that it is made with pieces of pork like the heart, the lungs, the spleen,
cooked in vinegar with coconut milk and some chili spices.
Really nice, really nice.
I love it too.
Very nice flavored.
- Yeah, it's so juicy.
Yeah, it's really juicy,
and the meat is so soft it melts in your mouth.
Really good pick, Mads.
- Yeah, but I didn't know that it's made from spleen and?
Heart and lungs.
You didn't know?
- No.
So here we have it, guys!
The Sili ice cream,
I have the volcano level!
See it here, and Mads has level two.
Enjoy Mads!
Wish me luck. I don't know if I can handle this.
So let's try.
Oh, thats spicy!
Yeah, volcano level, for sure.
It's really nice.
Really, really nice.
But very hot.
Yeah, very hot.
I think you will be in trouble tonight Mads.
- What?
After I finish this, you will be in trouble tonight.
How is your level 2?
- It's nice, try it.
This actually tastes more like ice cream.
This one tastes more like chili peppers.
Yeah, but that's nice.
Will you try. Will you try it?
Mads on fire.
Yeah, I wonder can I finish this.
We will see.
I'm not even halfway, guys, and I'm already breathing fire.
How is yours, Mads?
- It's good.
It's good.
How is it, love?
I'm breathing fire.
How's the pepper ice cream?
Is that chili pepper?
It's like...
Yeah, I try to finish it but it's so spicy.
- I am safe, it's mild.
- This one, ewww.
- Your tongue is getting hot.
Volcano level baby erupt like a Mayon volcano.
My tongue is on fire.
My tongue is on fire.
- Okay, Katy Perry. (it's Alicia Keys, Mads!)
I conquered the volcano.
We did it.
And Mads?
She doesn't even finish the second level.
And i was, it's so hot.
Yeah, it's spicy.
Volcano is volcano!
See Mads suffering from second level.
So Mads did you enjoy your Sili ice cream?
- Yes, a little. it's quite bit okay.
- But too spicy for me.
It was too spicy.
Yeah, mine was also too spicy.
- Yeah, because you chose volcano.
Yeah.
- The highest level.
Yeah, I chose the highest level;
you need to do it good.
Yeah.
- You're so relaxed.
I'm relaxed, yes.
Just my tongue is on fire.
- You're sweating a lot. Look at him.
I what?
- You sweat a lot.
No, I don't sweat.
- Oh, you don't sweat.
No... 
- Oh, okay.
So actually, this ice cream was coconut milk,
and then yeah, chili peppers, of course,
and this is the place where they invented it.
1st Colonial: The original dessert here the Sili ice cream.
Would I order it again?
For sure not the volcano level,
the second level I would because it has a quite unique flavor.
Yeah.
Yeah, yours was quite good.
Yours tasted actually like a little bit spicy, but still ice cream.
This one was just pure...
Yeah, volcano in my mouth.
So yes, I would order the second level again,
but no, I would never order the volcano again;
it's too hot for me.
I'm done.
We will ask for the bill now.
See you guys soon.
Thank you so much. Bye-bye, bye.
So here we have it, guys,
the Sili ice cream is in my tummy.
So, bye bye 1st Colonial Grill.
I will never take the volcano level again.
Maybe next time I go for the third level.
Maybe that would be better.
Now let's have a walk here in this area and see what we come across.
So it seems this place here is the public market in Legazpi.
I think it would be quite nice to check that one out.
This is heaven for you Mads.
A lot of different types of rice.
which one you prefer?
If you should pick one.
- Sinan Domeng that's a good quality of rice.
Pandan...
Peacock.
A here the red rice.
- This is sugarcane.
Sugarcane.
Are you sure?
Those bananas are so small.
- Yeah, they call it Saba.
Saba?
- Saba.
Saba bananas.
- You know the banana cue?
Yeah.
- You remember the banana cue, that's just like a barbecue?
Yeah.
- On the stick.
Ah, it's those one.
Okay, okay.
They have a lot of places where you can eat here, Mads.
- It's more on Filipino dishes.
Yeah.
A lot of local dishes here,
and there is the vegetable market over there.
a lot of fruits.
It's like we're on the banana farm here.
- Yeah.
Oh, what is this banana bread?
- No, do you know the spring wrapper?
- They can...
- That's the flour, so they can make a wrapper.
Ah, okay.
And they can even chill in a hammock.
That was a quick walk through the public market there in Legazpi.
Now let's go end this vlog at Ayala Mall.
So the Ayala Mall here opened in 2016
and quickly became one of the most popular shopping centers in the area,
and you can easily see why.
It has more than 200 stores inside,
and I'm sure that everybody can find something they need here.
Look, some small stands there.
with some food, jewelry, t-shirts...
Yeah, really nice,
and it seems later on they will have an event here or something like that.
Look at this.
Are they waiting for Robbie Travels here?
I guess not.
So Christmas decorations are still here.
That's nice.
They have a Toys"R"Us here.
So I'll for sure have to check that one out.
Maybe I can find something nice here for my collection.
They have a few Power Rangers items,
but not the one that I'm looking for.
Nope, unfortunately, not what I'm looking for.
So yeah, a shopping mall, it's just a shopping mall,
you know, nothing really special.
So I guess we will end our video here for today.
I hope you guys enjoyed our short first day here in Legazpi
because we're both so tired and didn't sleep at all.
So now we will go and say goodbye to you.
Bye bye from Robbie!
- Bye bye from Mads!
take care. Bye bye!
Yoooow!
Yeah, they really know how to make a...
Melon shake, I forgot.
Yeah, they really know how...
Um.
- Okay, one, two, three.
One, two, three, new one.
Yeah, they rally...
