We going to the Philippines 
doing a quick Visa Run [Music]
I just ran out of data now as a digital 
Nomad you always need internet so we're  
quickly looking for that unfortunately I don't 
get data, our scooter ran out of petrol the  
thing is now that you're out of Internet you 
actually realize how empty you are. Especially  
for a digital no matter I live on on 
my phone on my computer at all time.
[Music] We at Arnold's Coffee now. Charl just 
joined us. We are on the way to the airport we  
just came from Arnold's Cafe next door to where 
we drop our luggage. We drop our luggage ,put  
it in storage over there because there's Nomads 
it's quite difficult for us to carry everything  
and you know just have abundance of luggage when 
we travel so it's way cost effective for us and  
then we travel with minimum luggage on our flights 
which is a bit of a life hack I would say. Made it  
to the airport, well early for our flight look 
at all those people down there waiting for their  
arrivals, so as I mentioned earlier we we're 
going to the Philippines now only for two days,  
we're going to do what's commonly known as a Visa 
Run this means that as Nomads we're only allowed  
to live in certain areas depending on your visa 
for a month or maybe two months at a time and then  
you've got to leave and re-enter the country so 
that's essentially what we're doing going to the  
Philippines doing a quick Visa Run we'll be back 
in Bali for the next month see in the Philippines
