welcome one more week here to Manila.
well as always, before starting the video, please allow me to invite you to subscribe to the channel
I hope you help me with your subscriptions, your likes and especially with your comments to find out what you want to know about the Philippines
Before starting this video I want to make a clarification so that there will be no misunderstanding
a very complicated subject will be dealt with but something very important will be done to me so that people know what to expect
and what can't they expect to be here in the Philippines
what can be some difficulties that can be faced when arriving here
and the truth for me is very very important
there are situations that I would have liked to know before arriving in the Philippines
not to avoid coming but to help me make things more bearable
as in all places you will find good things, as we saw in the previous video
but you will also find bad things, that is totally inevitable
so today in this video we are going to review what have been the least liked things about the Philippines
so, we start
OK fine. well let's start, there is no specific order, not that I start with the one I like the most
or well, with the worst ...
it's not that it starts with the worst or ends with the worst, just ...
These are issues that we have lived here in the Philippines over the years
They have created certain complications for us to continue here
this is definitely part of the process of living somewhere else,
if it is sometimes difficult to move from one city to another while in your same country,
now to be changing from one country to another, it is also very complicated
but what to say when you are changing a continent?
leaving Latin America to come and live here in Asia, it really is a 180 degree change
Fortunately the Philippines is one of the countries within the region, which can be less challenging
or that may offer fewer changes to make
that they speak English is something that helps you to be here, to carry things, to communicate with people
It's not like going to Japan, for example, to Korea, and it just won't understand anything you're seeing
start studying a new language, a completely different culture
That would be massive, the Philippines has its challenges of course, but I think it is not as challenging as it can be for others
in other countries, so for all those who are in China in Japan or Korea
my respects, good for you
something personally, which I think is very important is really talking about the bad things you can find somewhere
because it just gives you a sense of realism a more organic question of what really happens in these places
I have come across many pages, with many bloggers that I think because of the desire to have followers and speak well of people
or not seeing the bad things, just looking to always see the beautiful in everyone
many things are omitted and I think that the audience can be lied to
and it's something that I don't want to do, it's my personal opinion I'm not involving anyone else
But I think it is important to speak it in a frank and direct way, so that they know what to expect when they get here
the first complicated thing to deal with here is transportation, the issue of transportation
It really is something that is lacking a lot here in the city, especially in Manila it is very complicated
do not have an effective public transportation system,
which causes people to buy cars or motorcycles to transport themselves a little more freely
but of course it originates a massive quantity of vehicles and consequently the traffic is generated more and more
and more and more and more and more, transport really is very precarious not effective
There are different ways of transporting, but really none of them meet the minimum to be taken into consideration
.
you can transport yourself by bus, there are some small trucks called UV Express,
which are like the combis in Mexico, you can transport yourself in a jeepney
we will make a specific video of these vehicles
you can transport yourself on a tricycle in some areas, in some regions or you can move by taxi, in Grab
and let's not forget the MRT (and LRT) which is the metro, the tRen or whatever you want to call him
but in the end, none of these means is really efficient,
so moving around the city at certain times can really be a nightmare
another important point is contamination
unfortunately the Filipino culture is not oriented to the preservation of the environment
that's why you can find that pollution is an important factor
there are a large number of public transport vehicles that are not in conditions to be operating but still do
They have been trying to improve things a bit but there are definitely a lot of vehicles
they should be out of circulation
There is so much contamination that many times when cleaning the tables or chairs or windows of an apartment as we are now
you find a black layer of all the soot you can breathe
with a week to stop cleaning you can see this layer on your furniture
and already being on the street the situation is much worse, not only in air pollution is considerable
but also the pollution of the water and the oceans has reached really critical levels
here in the philippines you can find news like these
with this point possibly many people can tell me that it is very exaggerated but
the weather is something that can also really play against you
for me a simple provincial who was in the center of the Mexican Republic
who had a moderately temperate climate and arriving here with other heat temperatures
It has really been difficult and it is not even the heat, I think that coping with the humidity has been the most difficult
because it is not only the heat that is outside, that you feel when you are under the sun's rays
just the atmosphere really feels warm, going outside,
Feeling like you're breathing hot air, you can't walk a block because it's already starting to drip with sweat
I personally have to be moving to go to work every day
no, my job is not here in this city, I have to move to the BGC area
and the truth, it is very complicated only because of the weather
many times I have to get to my office drenched in sweat
because the weather just doesn't help at all
take the crowded MRT at 38 degrees Celsius with humidity 80 and 90 percent
it really is awful
but hey I think the hardest thing was having a sweat like a pig
every time you go outside
there is an inherent issue of being outside your country and it is the change of habits and culture
there are many things here that still to date still cause me a lot of trouble
It causes me a lot of conflict, there are things that I can't understand
my mind still doesn't accept people doing this kind of thing
there are some hygiene and health issues that for me are basic and that for education many times you should not even do
unfortunately the Filipino does not usually have the same standards that we have in many parts of the world
one thing I still can't stand to date is chewing
make noises when they chew, it's something I've heard very recurring from places like China like Korea
and it's something they also do here in the Philippines
can you be eating quietly in a restaurant or in
anywhere and you will be listening to the Filipino who is doing
all the time at lunchtime, even in the cinema there are also times when it is very unpleasant to listen to them
who are eating popcorn or something else and with the little noise, the little noise, the little noise
I can't stand it
Another thing is that they burp, I don't mean a simple burp, ay, sorry.
is the one who grab and throw a
and no matter where you are, you can be on the street, where you say, people are free to do what they like on the street.
but you can find it in restaurants, people burping, you can find it in your office
that you have your partner next door working and suddenly he makes a
but you can hear the bastard in the office and not just the one next door
it's the one in the cubicle opposite, it's the office you're going through
It really is also a bit unpleasant, we have had that even in massages
taking the masseuse from repente feel here the fog and the sound of
to all that it gives, for us in Mexico, I know that in Latin America
It is something even considered as rude and disrespectful, here simply. It is not.
It is something very normal and the times I have had to comment on it and ask them not to do it
they even get offended!
also something super common is that they spit and spit everywhere
well I haven't had to spit indoors, I must admit that
I have never seen him indoors but on the street children spit,
women spit, men spit, old men spit,
It is not so recurrent but if you go to the street walking, we go here to the square
sure we find at least one or two people spitting on the street
and in the same way, for us it is not something common, it is not something well seen and
that is why the rejection of this type of situation, we even have to do with a lack of hygiene but well
another, here people urinate in the middle of the street
I think it is a question that is not well regarded in general
but in any case that is not an impediment to suddenly find people approaching the wall
next to the street and starts to urinate
especially men, which is much easier, I have had to see him entering here the building in which we live
on the side of a pole, urinating, it was like 2 in the morning but without shame
It has touched me being in a taxi and suddenly it is shore and I ask
What is it, why are you stopping the taxi here?
the driver gets off and urinates on the street
I have had to see patrols stop and the police stop to urinate in the street
you are walking down the street, there is some bush and you get a guy with his penis outside, because he is urinating on the street
you don't see it everywhere either, it's a little bit strange to see it but
I am sure that at some point you will find someone just urinating on the street
Now, a very important point and I think this is more related to work
that to everyday life and that is that they always tell you what, YES
and the Filipino by custom, by the culture they have colo ...
because of the culture that they have colonialism they are very submissive they do not tend to confront people and for everything it is yes, yes, yes, yes, yes
Even when they've understood a damn about what I just told them, they will never say no to you
very important, it is not like that, they are not all but in the great majority
this is something very common, it is something that I have heard from many people who have this concept and complain about it
because they don't know how to say no, it could be that he is explaining something related to some report
some activity, some job or something whatever
yes, yes sir, yes sir, yes sir
and so all the time, the time will come when you will ask for the information
you are going to request the report, you are going to review the activity
and they are simply going to be left with a face of: I don't know, I have no idea and here a rather complicated dynamic in labor issues begins to be generated
Since you are depending on that person to carry out an activity, you are delegating
To avoid thinking about it, you have the confidence to delegate it and things just don't work,
they do not walk and the worst thing is that they do not have the facility or the will to ask and say:
"I don't understand, please explain it to me again", they simply decide that time is consumed
that nothing is done and the moment you have to give a result, just do not give it
I know that in the previous video we were saying that one of the best qualities of the country is its people
but really at the same time it is also one of the situations that get to complicate a little more
possibly there are some people who tell me. No, you are exaggerating, that does not happen
people are super alive, it is super, everything is wonderful
If you have the advantage of having personnel that way, good for you, chingón. don't let them go
but the reality is that you are in a situation that is really handled and lived in a quite daily way
well done
I have ventured with you, it has served as a catharsis for many things that it brought
I still recommend that you come here to the Philippines, it is quite a place, quite recommended
It is spectacular in many ways, they have to have their reservations
But anywayif you have the possibility to come here to the Philippines, come, live it for yourselves
There's nothing like doing it that way, they don't tell you
so if you come to the Philippines I hope you let me know and we'll see you around here soon
thank you very much for watching the video, take care, see you next week
