- (FBE) Today, we're 
gonna have you taste
a few different Filipino vegetables.
- Let's go.
Yes. We're from the Philippines.
- I'm kind of nervous 
and kind of exciting.
- I'm Filipina.
I might have tasted 
some of the vegetables.
- (FBE) All these veggies
may not have originated
in the Philippines, 
but are all commonly used
in Filipino cuisine 
and were prepared
at a local Filipino restaurant.
- Sounds good.
- The Filipino snacks were okay.
But then the vegetables,
I don't know
because I've never had
Filipino vegetables.
- I'm pretty excited, but I'm like,
"What's it gonna be?
Which one's it gonna be?"
- (FBE) Here 
is your first vegetable.
We have a cooked version,
and a raw version for you.
- It looks like a pumpkin.
- It looks like a watermelon.
- This kind of looks 
like a pumpkin a little,
like a green pumpkin 
or like a watermelon.
- It tastes like a tomato,
and it's smooth like a potato.
- It tastes like mashed potatoes,
and I like how there's 
this stuff down here.
Like this sauce, it's really good.
- The texture and the flavor 
tastes a bit like a potato.
- The taste,
it's like sweet potatoes,
and it's like you put 
a bunch of spices on it.
- (FBE) This is kalabasa.
It is a large winter squash 
that resembles a pumpkin
and is typically grown
in the West Indies
and tropical America.
The meal you tried 
is called ginataang gulay.
- "Gulay." I tried that before.
- I've seen what it looks like
and tasted it
and we had this at dinner.
- That was really good.
That was amazing, actually.
- (FBE) Here is 
your next vegetable.
- It's like an eggplant 
or something?
- It looks like an eggplant.
And it's squishy. 
I don't like it.
- Hmmm.
Kind of a little sour.
I'm kind of tasting a teeny--
a small bit of pickle.
- It's a weird taste.
Kind of tastes like raw fish.
- It tastes worse than
I thought it would be.
I thought it was sweet.
- It tastes like you know 
when you finish a popsicle?
It tastes like the popsicle stick.
- It's very squishy.
It's not like mashed potato squishy.
It's more like tender squishy.
- (FBE) That was 
a Filipino eggplant.
It is longer and thinner
than American eggplants
and it almost looks 
like a purple cucumber.
The dish is called pinakbet,
which also includes
vegetables like okra 
and bitter melon.
- Oh! That's my favorite dish.
It tastes super good.
I like the different kinds 
of vegetables.
- I honestly only knew 
that there's one eggplant.
I never knew there was two.
- (FBE) Here is your next veggie.
- Wait, is this--?
Are these green beans?
- Looks like asparagus
with a long green noodle!
- Oh my gosh.
It's actually pretty long.
- It's okay.
It tastes like nothing.
- I really like it.
It tastes like a green bean.
- Pretty good.
Kind of reminds me
of spaghetti sauce.
- It's kind of juicy, but it's hard.
It's like a hard string bean.
- (FBE) That was called sitaw,
which is a long green bean.
The dish is called ginisang sitaw,
a very popular, 
easy to make meal,
with garlic, onions, and tomatoes.
- I kind of tasted tomato.
- I would try this again.
- At least it's better than 
the last one, I have to say.
- (FBE) Here's your next veggie,
and a picture of the raw version.
- Made out of leaves!
- This looks like a normal plant.
It looks like it 
could do zero harm
and then you get this.
- That looks, uh, very disgusting.
- I'm a little bit more on 
the scared side of this one.
That is an interesting taste.
It's actually not bad,
but the first one
was all gooey and stuff, 
so I was like...
- This looks so gross.
I am serious.
It sounds more gross than it looks.
(whimpering)
(muffled) Sour.
It's bitter and sour.
- The vegetable's bland.
No flavor at all.
- I don't really like it.
It kinda has 
a planty taste to it.
- (FBE) This is called a taro leaf.
The picture shows you
what it looks like
before it is dried, 
which is how the leaf
is commonly sold.
The dish you have is called laing,
which is dried taro leaves
boiled in coconut milk.
- Okay, that actually 
doesn't sound too bad.
- That's crazy.
I never-- I didn't even taste 
any coconut milk.
- You guys just ruined
coconut milk for me.
- (FBE) Here is your last veggie,
and a picture of the raw version.
- What is that?
- It looks like a mushroom.
- It looks like a really, 
really, really, really dried onion.
- I like it.
I like the crunchy stuff with it
because it tastes like carrots.
- I'm scared.
I like the flavor and I like
how it's kind of crunchy.
- I taste soy sauce.
I love soy sauce.
- I actually kind of like this one.
It's kind of hard on the outside,
but then it's really soft 
and nice on the inside.
- (FBE) That dish
is called labong.
It is made of bamboo shoots
peeled and sliced into thin pieces.
We have a picture 
because they are sold
in various processed shapes
and are only available
in fresh, dried, or canned versions.
- What?
I'm eating bamboo?
- How is that a bamboo shoot?!
Bamboo's what pandas eat,
and it's all straight
and it's like...
- I would try this again.
It's good. It's really good.
- (FBE) So which 
vegetable or meal
would you recommend people eat?
- I would recommend
people eating the beans,
the string beans.
- The Filipino eggplant.
- Bamboo shoot.
- The bamboo shoot.
- I'd recommend the bamboo shoot.
- I would recommend 
the bamboo shoot
because it tastes really good!
- I would recommend the labong.
It was an experience,
I'll just say that.
