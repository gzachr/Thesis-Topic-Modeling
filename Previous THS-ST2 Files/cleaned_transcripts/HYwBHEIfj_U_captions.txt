so in today's video we are in manila 
philippines and we're heading to eastwood  
which is a part of the city right now the 
car is overheating and uh the driver's uh
he's dumping some water on it to cool it off right 
now but we should be on the road again in a second  
so it was overheating right now he just 
dumped a bunch of water on it and the  
overheating light went off so i guess 
it worked so let's go check out eastwood
so i've made my way over here to eastwood i 
got recommended and so far this place is pretty  
awesome this is like this is what's cool about the 
big cities is there's so many cool little areas  
and cool little pockets within the city you think 
like oh bgc makati is like the coolest places but  
this has a different this place is really nice too 
it has a different kind of flare to it i like this  
so far there's a lot more plans but we got 
to keep going keep exploring this place
okay so i just spotted this this little tram here
i guess it's free so i guess 
it goes around the the area  
over here the city so let's check 
this out see where this takes us
it's finally sunny too since i've been here 
because every day since i've been here it's  
been raining cloudy which honestly has 
been kind of nice because this tropical  
sun is no joke it's a strong high uv ships
pretty cool that's just like a little tram that 
goes around it's kind of like little shopping  
residential living area over here does it it 
doesn't go very far actually i think you can see  
right here oh yeah look i got dropped off right 
there and then it flips around and it picks up  
right here that might be the um i should i should 
actually do where i get on right there and then it  
does u-turn and then get off of the next stop and 
that'd be kind of funny i'm gonna head into the  
cyber mall right now because i still need to get a 
microphone for this camera and i haven't been able  
to find the specific one they have it online but 
i've been trying to find it in the actual store  
so let's see if i can find it so man in the 
cyber mall they don't have a camera store at  
the moment bgc they had a microphone similar to 
the one that i'm that i have that i want to get  
but it was the big one they have a micro version 
that i need to get cause i mean i use a gopro so  
it's pretty small but i'll find one one day so 
i stop right here i'm gonna get a little snack  
i got some quick quick and some fish balls i'm 
gonna eat but i wanna show you this too there's  
this whole little outdoor area that's kind of in 
the same vicinity i can't walk over there though  
because the music's too loud i gotta blast it 
philippines has their music down it's bad for you
all right got a little sweet sauce and 
a little sukkah the vinegar on there
quick quick is always good got the fish ball too
that's good too nice little lunch 60 pesos  
so this area is pretty cool they got um 
like all these little shops and eateries  
all these plants they look like they got some 
kind of event they're building right here
not too sure what that is
but this has got a little bit different of a 
vibe to it than the rest of manila so far that  
any place that i've been to this kind of has i 
don't know what the vibe is here it's kind of  
something different i like it though something 
new oh i guess this is like a little fair
i'm sure this place is just busy after once 
everybody gets off of work in the evening  
times yeah check it out they got all these 
little eateries and stuff over there right here
stuff everywhere so when i first started this 
video i was on the opposite side just in the  
courtyard at this place i picked up the bus 
right there rolled the bus all the way around  
i think i came around twice came in walked 
through over there came up came through  
right here and then now i'm walking right here 
and then it kind of goes around through here  
so it's like this like little 
intricate web like this little city
so this is another cool part of manila 
this is like a little city within a city  
i kind of started to notice that now it seems 
like there's like uh they kind of build like  
these metropolises this is interesting you know 
it seems like this is because i feel like they're  
doing this in vietnam so i feel like in ho 
chi minh like they have the vin homes builds  
and stuff there's like little cities within the 
city you know it's nothing but tall buildings
a bunch of big businesses residential it's all 
kind of like within its own little ecosystem
you see look right here it's a perfect example 
this is exactly what i was talking about  
right now it's right here here's like the 
start of it it's like the city over here
and it just feeds right in well yeah there 
it is there's a little tour of east walk  
or eastwood city this is in kaizon city got 
recommended by some subscribers and i thought  
i had to go check it out so if you're ever in 
manila and you want to go to different places or  
even if you think about staying in quezon i 
noticed that things are maybe a little bit  
cheaper out here than they are in manila mccoxy 
and obviously bgc yeah actually i think a lot  
cheaper because i just ate lunch right now 
and it was i was surprised like i bought a  
cold bottle of water right now for 15 pesos and 
that's not like that in macaques in manila so  
anyways i hope you enjoyed this video thank 
you for watching and we'll see you next time
