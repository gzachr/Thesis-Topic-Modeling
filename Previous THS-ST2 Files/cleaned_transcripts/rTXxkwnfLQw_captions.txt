for coming up with the name we love 
it Azul means blue so let's just go on  
come on Patagonia Patagonia remember oh yeah 
this is uh from China check Market in Thailand
here we are
foreign
for like a few seconds we literally just walked 
in the door but I can tell you right now we're  
already gonna love this place I already love it 
I'm sure Jose is going to love it like right yeah  
me being the queen that I am how cool is it to 
repurpose piping and make these cool lights out  
of it's literally everywhere you look use it 
for curtain rods they use it for the man-made  
shelves they use it for to hold the safe in 
the refrigerator they use it for the table  
legs come on my favorite part is the Wardrobe 
so as you can see here you can hang your shirts  
so much to look through me personally I 
love being in my favorite shirt of all time  
and no it's at the villain is a travel 
shirt which you can get on the merch shop  
many of you guys probably think he wears the same 
shirt over and over again but no he literally  
has actually five of these one of them being mine 
that he won't let me wear until I'm in good graces  
okay well first off it's not yours I bought it 
because I found it if you don't know the story  
in Bangkok I bought this shirt at chatter check 
Market we went back I don't know how many times  
every time we went we saw the same shirt in a 
new stall so I'm like we're gonna get them all  
and you know what here we are it's part of my 
identity becoming beautiful flowy Comfort brown  
black like me white like me when it comes to 
any good accommodation is a great bed behind  
it and there's no surprise that this one does not 
disappoint it's massive quite as well we'll say  
masibo there are six pillows so enough for us 
to distribute and not have to fight over them  
we don't fight over it it's just that I always 
like to have an extra pillow to hold when I'm not  
holding him so I put a pillow on both sides of me 
that way when I toss and turn and pull over like  
I have something to hold on to most of the time 
I prefer the pillow because it's not like clammy  
but love you Jose and before moving on we're gonna 
do the bad test with peace star all right P you up  
for a challenge it's a big challenge are you 
sure okay well if you're not at four how are  
you sure okay well we're gonna do a bed challenge 
so when I count to three you're gonna jump one p  
he doesn't listen since we'll be Negroes 
for an entire month we're always looking for  
accommodations with a workstation and this one's 
perfect normally we will both be sitting next  
to each other working on projects but since my 
computer and I will be just sharing one computer  
while the other one can lay in bed relaxing while 
watching some TV that is right above me four  
sorry this really caught me 
off guard hi oh no hello hello
well anyways this is a huge mirror here by the way 
by the door so when you're getting ready to leave  
you can check and make sure you're put together 
before you touch that doorknob no crusted and  
busted people you know us you guys we love a 
good accommodation that has a fridge and this  
one does not disappoint whoa look at that oh

I've ever seen it on the menu because it's

relaxed Bungalow do we have a neighbor here

prayer rooms nah pool let's go
these are much larger these are bigger I'm 
assuming these have actually I know for a  
fact because somebody had their door open these 
actually have bunk beds inside and a large bed but  
cater to families so you're probably wondering 
why is it named after White Chocolate Hills  
Resort or what's what's the meaning behind the 
name and Will's gonna show you why or where it  
gets its name from so what Jose was referring to 
these it looks like the Chocolate Hills in Bohol  
they're cute these little Mounds wait these 
are adorable look at that they're so pretty  
that's so aren't they so super 
freaking cute on the outside  
they're like what you would picture at like 
any Island that you want to like step foot on  
and want to spend a vacation on like Cottages I 
agree they're very well kept by the way like the  
weaving is tight you know what this is the first 
time I've been anywhere in the Philippines and I  
have not seen a gap at least a half inch wide 
around the air conditioner it's true and this  
is Seal they have everything sealed no insect 
will ever get in unless you have the door open  
uh no they're gonna fight their way in okay this 
is cool and it's private beach access it's hot oh
oh my gosh look at the water it's so calming it's 
actually really calm it's actually really calm
tried to find
some peace
lost in
no
mmm grass yummy delicious
wait oh it's oh
hide it dude I was not expecting that when 
you're sitting at a resort especially by  
a beach you better expect them to have 
beach access yeah so this is nice this  
is actually really nice you're 
on the beach this is all Beach  
so Jeffrey doesn't say so yeah two 
thumbs up two thumbs up two thumbs up
all right we're going back to the resort
so it looks like they used to 
have a dive shop a dive shop  
but because of you know why 
I love a good hammock sorry
sink Rock-a-bye Baby rock my way Liam on the 
palm trees here we are in the Philippines now  
get your butt up because we have to go 
swim now my little William please wake  
up you should said please listen you're not 
a good Lyricist but my vocals are top-notch
while you're staying here at White Chocolate Hills 
Resort some of the amenities are not just a pool  
but you're also able to schedule a massage or a 
manicure and pedicure so if your feet are looking  
like ours after the Trek we did at Casa roro 
you might need to schedule a pedicure man they  
look like that candy corn the Halloween candy corn 
I'm not going to show do not put this video down  
do not but yet Jose I see you I think you're about 
to fall so stop also look at us we're so cute  
oh my gosh you're giving me a kiss we're so cute
there's the William
and there's me work colorful on the outsides we 
are on the inside there's also this cute little  
wishing well so if you happen to have a peso or 
two be sure to drop it in this little nugget and  
wish William and I another 2K subscribers we'll 
get there we'll get there in time it's a little  
bit of a slower crawl for us nothing we're not 
used to still gonna put in the good work so  
to those that are subscribed thank 
you we love you guys and mwah oh
and please please throw a peso in there 
wishing me safety because clearly I cannot walk
the best thing I did and I want 
you to know was letting you  
with from that moment I knew that 
you were all I missed baby hi
all right let's swimming 
what would you rate this poor
honestly this is the first pool we've 
been in that's deeper than six feet tall
the ground so that's nice you actually feel 
like you know you're not in the Kitty pools
you coming Jose I'm a Rottweiler 
look at this little baby
you're out of breath boo I don't know how 
people could swim long distance I'm exhausted
this is what happens when you grow up in the city 
and don't feel like you need to learn how to swim  
as a survival skill now I'm paying it here in the 
Philippines when I can't do half the things I want  
to do because I'm too scared to get into the deep 
end okay time but let's let's have some real talk  
about me trying to teach you yes that's true 
he has been trying to teach me or let's go sign  
up those methods aren't working no you're not 
working that's the problem you're not working  
that's why that's why I'm more of an inland person 
than each person because I feel like I thrive more  
and I'd rather I rather follow my butt in mud 
than to flounder around in water and see yes
would you give them if it's anything less than 
10 don't comment below all right guys we just  
got out of the pool was in the shower at the 
moment and I just want to say this room is  
extremely spacious I literally feel like I could 
do somersaults splits and cartwheels in here if I  
was able to with that being said great room we're 
gonna get dressed well I'm already dressed wasn't  
a fish showering I'm gonna go have dinner and 
we'll get back with you all tomorrow morning

this you are such a sweetheart thank you thank

we were invited here we had no idea is that
