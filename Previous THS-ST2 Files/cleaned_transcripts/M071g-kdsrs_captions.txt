It's very sharp
We just reached the top
Hello good morning
We are gonna do a crazy adventure this morning
We are leaving for the Taraw Cliff
It's 5am
We are ready
We are well equipped as you can see
It will take more or less one hour
And for now we are waiting for our guide
We planned to meet here 3 days ago
But no way to contact him
So, we can just wait for him now
But the problem is
We didn't find him
Now the sun begins to rise
We tried to find another solution to go there with
an other guide
So we are going anyway
We are crossing very small streets
Ah, the chicken
It means it's the morning
For the beginning of the walk
We can see some rocks everywhere
We just reach now the climbing part
Now I'm hurt by the heat
It's because I'm wearing a trousers
Because I don't have short anymore
This is a traveller mistake
It's funny to do some climbing
And even more in such a place
And to see a sunrise
It's perfect
Once again the only problem is the sweat
It's so hot
It's already 28 degres and it's not even 6am
It's cool, the way in the jungle
Among all those rocks
It's a little bit funny
I agree it's not the easiest thing to record here
But it's ok
Second climbing part
We follow the boss
We continue the ascent
Are you ok ?
Perfect
First reaction with all the sweat
So, I like the climb
I feel like I'm doing outdoor climbing
It's so so cool
Unfortunetly we let
A member of the group on the road
For the Taraw Cliff, you should not go by yourselve
Because it's a dangerous place
You have to go there with a guide
And there are some accidents each year
So sharp
I think we will reach the top soon
It's seems to be just here
It seems to be unbelievable
We reach the top
We will not lie
It's amazing
Are you hit by the heat at the top ?
I'm dying here
the portholes are full of steam
Are you sponsored by the way ?
I think that it's a little bit high here
Because if we pay attention here
It's very high
We reached Taraw Cliff's top
It's something to do
It's wonderful
We have a crazy view
with a perfect sun
We are at the top of the Taraw Cliff
Now I just finished the drone session
Now we just have to enjoy every second
Enjoy the landscape
Because it worth it
Those rocks are so sharpened
It's 8am
We will begin the way back
The most interesting is to go there for the sunrise
We are going to go back home
We need to do the same way but opposite direction
I think it's more easy to go up then down
And after we are going to take a good breakfast
Because it will be well deserved
Do you see what the rocks look like
How are you doing ?
It's ok
The way back looks like more difficult
It's very impressive seen from above
We can see the sharp rocks that we climbed
We can see a lot better now
We just discover something
When you hit a rock it makes a metalic noise
Very strange
A big turkey
We are back in the main street
It was a crazy adventure
Just happiness and a lot of sensation
