Darren Espanto is an amazing singer
we were very surprised by his voice.
And let's go for what matters.
Now we want to hear Darren sing!
Let's react!
Impressive
the ease he has to make Melismas
the ease he has to make Melismas.
Truth. His voice
very light
and in this video he is younger
we can see 
that he has vocal ability
in both regions
and this facilitates for him 
the use of these 
very difficult techniques.
Yes, we can see that he is younger
I may be wrong, 
but I think it's the first reaction 
to him younger.
And his voice was still forming
especially for being so young
The transitions he makes,
they're very beautiful
a good extension for high notes
we are surprised
because it is the first time that 
we see him using his voice this way.
I need to talk about
the emission and projection
His belting is very powerful.
It's a very difficult technique
and he was so young already using this technique
from very young
He was already delivering a work of the highest quality
melismas demands a lot of agility,
Belting demands a lot of vocal power
It's cool to see his evolution,
and get to know your voice better
in the video of Morissette 
he uses the lower register
in a different way.
At one point we can
hear to the fine work he does
in the middle region of the voice
He uses the mask voice a lot
and this makes the note heavier
obviously not sound in the same way
but we can see that he already sang very well.
Amazing
very cool to see
that from very young
he already had an artistic personality
his interpretation is very good,
even though he is sitting
he sings with his body
he has a great vocal ability.
It is very interesting to see 
that in the end it increases the note
he makes a transition bo Belting, 
for the Falsetto
I'll speak quickly about Falsetto.
In ancient times
the Falsetto had as purpose
increase notes
In the old days,
women could not sing in the Ã“pera
men played this role.
And this has become more modern,
before it was like this...
In a contemporary way
the technique receives more pressure
the increase note feature is maintained, 
but with much higher air pressure.
Has Transitions, and Drives
And he did everything in a magnificent way
He's really a great singer.
Everything was very beautiful and excellent.
No doubt!
But this is our opinion
now we want your opinion
write what you think about
this beautiful performance of Darren?
