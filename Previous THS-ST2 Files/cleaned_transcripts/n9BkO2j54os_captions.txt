hey everyone it's michael here again and 
welcome to another one of our videos and in  
this particular video we're going to be talking 
about what are the top things that turn offs  
filipinas to foreigners that's right first of 
all guys before we get started just want to say  
if you haven't yet if this is your first time 
you've been here before make sure you subscribe  
click that subscribe button and then just go 
ahead and ring that bell to be notified of  
upcoming videos coming up that we're going to be 
having and launching on a weekly basis now just  
let's talk about turn offs now just because you're 
the almighty you know foreigner or expat that's  
going to be coming here to the philippines all 
of a sudden you think that nothing can go wrong  
that all the filipinos will just come rushing at 
you but anyways i just want to share with you guys  
some of the top turn offs that i've heard from 
filipina's talk about foreigners and i'm going  
to share that with you guys so that you know you 
guys are ready to go so that there's no other  
additional objections that can happen from 
the women that you're going to meet here in  
the philippines and the first turn-offs that a 
lot of filipinos say they have with foreigners
are facial hair especially beards now you know in 
the western world in the u.s especially you know  
beards are in everybody's are everyone's growing 
beards nowadays right and you know i wish i could  
grow a beard i can't really do that good job and 
because you know in the western world in the us  
for example you know a man who's able to grow a 
nice set of beard a nice beard you know is look at  
is look at as manly right and for you to be 
able to grow facial hair you have to have  
a good amount of testosterone to be able to do 
that right and the thing though is and actually  
november right there's this thing called no shave 
november nowadays that's a that's an in thing and  
here in the philippines it's totally different 
hair is totally unacceptable and so for filipinas  
you know they just don't like that scruffy look 
on a man and second not just the beard body hair  
right it's such a turn off for filipinos for guys 
that have a tremendous amount of body hair and  
let's not even talk about you know hair in the 
boote you know ass hair pretty much as you might  
say you know it's really a turn off for them they 
they will really tell you guys that they're like  
you know um what's the word nandidire means 
dirt it's gross and look guys it's 20 21 by  
the time you guys probably watch this video um the 
frontal area down there the frontal area you know  
go ahead and invest in some nice pair of you know 
of clippers and just trim down there it's a good  
thing the ladies will appreciate it trust me okay 
so you know can't have no hairy balls hanging  
on you at this very moment nowadays all right 
just be kind and just go ahead and remove that  
all right the next thing that they always say that 
is such a big turn off is bad skin and when we're  
talking about bad skin is that you know a person 
who doesn't take good care of their skin you know  
they're very oily or just just not taking care 
of their skin you know filipinas do and invest so  
much in taking care of their skin you know they 
have morning routines they have night routines  
you know they walk around with umbrellas because 
they don't want to get dark they don't want to get  
you know they don't want you know as much as 
possible they want to look young as possible  
and and that is honestly why a lot of asian people 
you know especially filipinas as well just don't  
don't look like they age at all they may be 30 
but they still look like they're in their 20s  
or teens at times it's because they take good 
care of their skin they pay attention to that  
you know and so you as a foreigner 
as an expat just like myself  
one thing that we can do is we we definitely want 
to be able to look younger and and pay attention  
to this right you know typically you're going to 
see a lot of foreigners and expats you know with  
a younger filipino i'm not just talking about the 
the wide age gaps you know you're going to see a  
gentleman who's maybe 40 who's with a 20 year old 
you know and so having that you know difference  
in age sometimes because a lot of filipinas are 
turned on by you know people who are more mature  
because they say a lot of filipinos here are 
just immature for their age and so wouldn't  
you want to at least try to do a good job on 
taking care of your skin so that let me guess  
you don't look like that grandfather or that great 
grandfather to your significant other okay now you  
know i can say that i don't do an a really good 
job taking care of my skin but i sure do try  
i sure try right i'm not that good at 
you know having a routine but i sure try  
at least do and put some effort in it now 
the third turn off for a lot of filipinas  
is bad breath and they're not really saying that 
you know bad set of teeth or anything like that  
but they're just saying it's bad breath it's such 
a big turn off and this is going to go pretty much  
all over the world anyways but pay attention 
to your breath and a lot of you guys you know  
you're going to be flying into the philippines 
for example um to come meet your lady well you  
know most of the time is if you already have a set 
lady already coming here to meet you and greet you  
more likely they might want to pick you up in the 
airport so listen when you have those long flights  
they give you that little you know care package in 
the airlines where they give you a toothpaste they  
give you a toothbrush they give you that you know 
the eye mask covering for so you can go to sleep  
um that toothpaste is not really the best 
toothpaste in the world so i truly suggest  
is just have yourself a little man pack where you 
have a small tube of toothpaste so that you can  
really take care of your breath 
have them have a mouthwash in there  
and when you get off the plane when you land in 
either you land in manila or you land in cebu or  
you land in pampanga brush your teeth first 
before you know right after you go through  
customs okay just take care of that business 
first so that when you're when you see your lady  
when she meets you in the terminal your breath 
smells good because you don't want to start off  
the whole meeting where she she looks forward to 
seeing you and you give her a kiss and then all  
of a sudden dragon breath so you don't want 
to you definitely want to avoid that right  
the next thing is it kind of goes both ways number 
four number five is feet really nasty feet and  
also nails right so my suggestion guys is before 
you come to the philippines go get yourself a mani  
pedi yes look some of you guys are like that's 
some girly stuff you know no no it's not that's  
metrosexual stuff no no it's not it's basic health 
issues taking care of yourself yes a mani pedi in  
the united states maybe in europe is going to cost 
you somewhere around 50 for a mani pedi set right  
yes don't you know if you start telling yourself 
well i'll just get it done in the philippines but  
here's the thing if your ladies meeting you then 
all of a sudden you guys are you guys share a room  
together then all of a sudden she wakes up with 
some funky toes is that really something that  
you want just a small thing that could a slight 
turn off you don't want any of those little small  
subtle objections happening so get that done right 
and when you're in here in the philippines with  
your lady have a mani pedi date take her to the 
spa have a couple's massage have a foot massage  
it's a good thing for you guys it's a good 
thing to make yourself feel good and look good  
you want you definitely want to avoid some of 
these turn offs from happening and trust me the  
things i'm sharing with you guys right now are 
things that i've heard myself from filipinas  
on what they have shared about what are the things 
that turned them off with some foreigners trust  
me filipino guys here in the philippines they take 
care of that they go get themselves some pedicures  
because it's something that's important 
now the next thing is more of like an  
attitude and that is controlling a lot of 
filipinos find foreigners who are controlling  
as a turn off you guys have to understand 
filipinas are leaving by droves not wanting  
to be with local filipinos and one of the biggest 
reasons they don't like filipinos other than them  
filipinos are tend to be immature for their 
age is also the part where a lot of filipinos  
are very controlling it's that spanish machismo 
um culture that got transferred in the philippines  
they're they're a lot of them are very controlling 
and very jealous and filipinos are trying to leave  
the filipinos move away from that because 
they view foreigners in a different light  
and so with that said because they view foreigners 
us foreigners and expats in a different way  
you know then we definitely want to be 
making sure that we don't have that now look  
being controlling especially especially with 
the age gap sometimes it happens a lot with  
the larger age gap relationships because 
instead of it becoming a how would you say a  
uh a boyfriend girlfriend husband and wife type 
of a relationship it sometimes feel as if a father  
and daughter relationship is what happens and the 
elder foreigner or expat treats the young girl  
more like a daughter rather than a significant 
other so you want to avoid that type of acting  
and if you are a man who's controlling um you need 
to kind of ease it up or do some self-assessments  
to try to minimize that because that can become 
a toxic fume in a relationship and you don't want  
that to happen with you and your filipina that 
you're about to meet or you're about to marry  
the next thing is that a lot of filipinas find 
um turn offish is because unfortunately there  
are a lot of foreigners that come here um in the 
philippines to have a good time you know have one  
of those bachelor lifestyles and there's also a 
lot of foreigners that look at filipinas as you  
know what you know this is something that a lot of 
foreigners call filipinos right lbfms little brown  
effing machines right and so just because yes 
there are places here in the philippines where  
you as a bachelor lifestyle to come here and 
have fun and i don't have anything against that  
if a foreigner if an expat comes here to 
the philippines to do those type of things  
i am not here to judge anyone do you that's you 
right and there's nothing wrong with that you want  
to enjoy yourself enjoy yourself in a safe manner 
but not all filipinas just because they want to  
look sexy and look good and go out drinking that 
doesn't mean that they deserve to be treated  
and deal with a bunch of perverts now 
there's a fine line that separates  
being flirtatious and being a pervert right 
you wanna definitely avoid crossing that line  
flirtatious is fine just don't be a pervert 
like i'll tell you a good example right  
you know it was hilarious it's like you 
know i was hanging out with some friends  
and the this one guy approaches this 
girl and she's and he goes you know  
do you want to uh hang out and go to a motmot now 
this is the filipino gentleman who did this right  
because a lot of filipinos will tell you this 
filipino guys a lot of filipinos here are just  
are are the term manyakis right you know pretty 
much a pervert and you know that's a pickup line  
let's go to a mothmat if you don't know what 
a mothmot is it's pretty much a slang word for  
a motel a hook-up motel you know there's a lot of 
motels a lot of multimods here in the philippines  
that are what they call short time stay like 
you can literally ten dollars you can stay at  
this place for three hours just to you know 
do the deed so do the deed right so that's  
that's that's hey look nothing wrong 
with that but the thing though is  
a lot of filipinos here tend to be a bunch of 
perverts and they think that that's the way to  
treat a woman or or that's the way you talk to a 
woman and there's videos out there of filipinos  
doing video tutorials teaching other filipinos 
that this is how you're supposed to be  
a mr suave a you know a pickup artist and this 
is how women love to be talked to and treated  
but a great woman the good woman that you want to 
marry that you want to have a relationship with  
do you really want to treat them in the in 
a pervert way to be a pervert to them no  
you definitely don't want to do that so try to 
avoid those type of setups you know you know the  
first time you end up chatting with a girl online 
let's say and you're already asking for nudies  
because you heard from a foreigner expert 
that that's okay to ask without establishing a  
relationship right so you want to thread that fine 
line of being a pervert or just being flirtatious  
right uh the next one is you know a lot 
of filipinos complained that a lot of  
guys here filipino guys here you know they're 
they're lazy right you know you have a bunch of  
25 year olds still living at home not even having 
or holding a job and a lot of them just wants to  
you know hang out or do what they call gimmick 
like after they work if they are working they go  
out with friends and they go drink and hang out 
right so a lot of the guys here you know a lot  
of the girls look at them and say you know guys 
filipinos here you know not all of them but a good  
average of them are kind of lazy and all they want 
to do is hang out have a good time and go drinking  
and that's something that turns off a lot of 
women so you know if you guys are visiting here  
you know hang out with your lady but that doesn't 
mean get drunk every night you know do some small  
stuff with them not just chill in the bedroom 
and all you want to do is if you know what it is  
right do some stuff here when you come here show 
them that you want to have an active life you want  
to be able to show them that there is something 
that they're going to want to look forward to  
doing with you if you decide to move here or 
if you decide to bring them to your country  
so once again a lot of filipinos are trying 
to move away from what they're experiencing  
with the filipino men here and so they're hoping 
that it's different for them in the other side  
and the worst thing is they have this belief that 
the grass is greener on the other side but what if  
they get to the other side and it's brown because 
the person that they end up with was a controlling  
jealous person and is a lazy drunk as well right 
so we definitely want to be able to understand  
that filipinas are very smart people and they're 
starting to learn and they're starting to see  
things and we definitely want to make sure that we 
avoid this from happening that that people start  
thinking of us foreigners and expats coming to the 
philippines as just a bunch of pervert lazy drunk  
people right another thing that a lot of filipinas 
really fine as a turn off are men that are  
not really good in the sack they kind of 
figure that you know if they end up with  
a more mature man that you've been around that 
you'd already know what to do in bed and just  
let you guys know filipinos are very demure but 
trust me they do know what they want intimately  
they've heard stories philippines is the 
porn capital of the word world meaning  
that the pornhub for example there are more 
viewers of pornhub in the philippines than  
in the united states on a study that 
was done like about three years ago  
right women research here a lot of women here 
are are you know they say it's like they say  
that filipinas are not liberated no filipinas are 
there's gonna be just like anywhere in the world  
where you know you are gonna have the people who 
are more you know held back more repressed you  
know here in the philippines you know you have 
that but of course there's a good majority also  
who you know probably live in the province who 
are not as exposed to going out and having fun  
and hooking up and stuff like that but you know 
there's a lot of women out here who know what they  
want and the last thing that they want is some 
guy who doesn't know what they're doing in bed so  
you know that's something that you are going to 
have to work on if you end up with a filipina  
because once again it's a turn off for them just 
like more likely it's going to be a turn off for  
you if you end up with somebody who doesn't know 
what they do in the in the sack right so it's  
going to be the same thing for them right and 
so just go ahead and make sure that you handle  
the business when you're doing that right um 
the other thing that turns them off is you  
having a bad attitude towards your family 
or you trash talking your family now  
you know you're gonna hear your filipina complain 
about their family about their friends sometimes  
but that's them and they can do that but if you 
jump into the bandwagon and you go ahead and  
try to trash talk their mom their dad their lolo 
their lola their best friend or any of that stuff  
prepare to really get some attitude back at you 
guys so make sure that you don't do that another  
one is never talk about the philippines bad don't 
bad talk filipinos don't bad talk to philippines  
don't be don't be start talking i hate this 
about the philippines oh my god you know you  
and your filipino time oh you and your traffic 
oh you guys are this you guys are dead oh you  
know i heard this one expat gets robbed is it true 
that's just dangerous in the philippines you know  
don't voice those things out because filipinos 
love their country and you don't want to offend  
the country and talk bad about the country or 
the culture because remember the woman that  
you're with is filipina so if you make fun of 
the country you're pretty much making fun of her  
so just try to avoid those and i've 
seen a lot of filipinos say that really  
just turned them off now another one which is 
probably the main thing that a lot of them say  
is a turn off and this is more when you're in a 
relationship is the guy who really doesn't know  
what he wants in life especially if you're older 
and you still don't have a plan you know they  
want to be able to hear what's your one your 
three or five year plan and they also want to  
know are they included in the in that plan that 
you're creating that you want to have together
so you know a good way is when you're telling 
these stories of what your plans are what you're  
you know you look forward to include them 
in that story include them in that storyline  
you know they want to know if they're 
going to give and invest your time with you  
that there's an end goal to things right are you 
gonna move to the philippines over here or are you  
gonna find somebody and bring them to your country 
you know what's going to be the invi what's  
going to be the vision of life living in in the 
states or in italy or in france or in australia  
so you guys have to make sure that a lot 
of these basic things that i just shared  
with you guys which came from a bunch 
of filipinos who have dated foreign men  
that you pay attention to this you know your beard 
it's a no-no guys it really is skin take care of  
that your breath your nails your toes you know 
manny and petty make sure you're getting that  
don't be overtly controlling and jealous you know 
stick to the flirtatious part but not being a  
pervert you know take care of your skin don't be 
a lazy drunk you know don't be lazy in bed don't  
have a bad attitude to the filipino community or 
the country itself don't make fun of their family  
their friends you know our relatives pretty 
much don't do that and also make sure that  
you do have a plan if you plan to actually be with 
a filipina right you're trying to move away from  
the filipinos because of the bad attitudes that 
they have the last thing that you want to do is  
to be similar to them just with lighter skin so
