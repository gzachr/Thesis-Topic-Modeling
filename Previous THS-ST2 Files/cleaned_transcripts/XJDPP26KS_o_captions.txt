[Because we are already hungry, let's eat first, here in Shake Shack]
-What is Shake Shack, American?

[Looks like you are enjoying your burger]
[of course, especially I didn't have to pay for this]
[We are at least not cooking today, just eating]
[Yeah and we really need the fuel, have to eat before we do the tour of the markets]
[Shake Shack is really good]
