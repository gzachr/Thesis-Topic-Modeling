Ever since she became a single mother
food has been scarce for Myrna and her
six-year-old daughter Mary Joy. For weeks
at a time, the only thing they had to eat
were yams. Over time Mary Joy became
malnourished. "I helped out on my parents
small farm to bring a little food home
to my daughter, but with only yams Mary Joy
started getting sick and weak
because we didn't have enough to eat.
Sometimes I had to choose between buying medicine or food." "I wanted to help my mom
plant vegetables, but I have to stay home
when I am sick." Then two typhoons hit the
Philippines and destroyed their home.
Mary Joy and her mom ran to her
grandparents. "I was scared.
The wind was so strong it shook
grandma's house. After the storm, my
cousins and I slept on one bed, my mom
slept on the cold floor." "I didn't know
how I could rebuild my house. The crops
on the farm had been washed away. Life
seemed so hopeless,
then CBN's Orphan's Promise came to their community. First we started a food
program for Mary Joy and other
malnourished children there. Since the
feeding program began, she hasn't gotten
sick. She's full of energy.
Next we gave Myrna everything needed to
make and sell organic compost. Business
is booming! Finally we built Myrna and
Mary Joy a new home. "We have more space
to move around. Our new home is a symbol of hope. I'm grateful to God who has
given me a chance to provide for my
daughter."
"Thank you very much!"
