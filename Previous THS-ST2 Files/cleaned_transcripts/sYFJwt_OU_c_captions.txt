We will show you the Philippines in several weeks. 
In several episodes. Why the Philippines? Why are  
you in the Philippines? Do you have a message 
for the world? World peace. Hey champs! What's  
happening? Welcome to another episode of: "Tag 
Along With Chai". We are at Pinto Art Gallery,  
located in the city of Antipolo. This city is 
located next to Manila. Right next to Manila. When  
you drive from Manila to Antipolo you don't even 
have the feeling you're leaving the city because  
the cities are kind of colliding with each other. 
Because they're growing and growing. They're  
expending. Beauty of the Philippines I'd like to 
show you in several episodes. And unfortunately,  
because we have only a few weeks here 
in the Philippines, I have to choose,  
what I gonna show. I would like to show you the 
beauty of the Philippines. Now we're standing in  
front of this Art Gallery because this is a must 
scene in Antipolo. If you're visiting Antipolo,  
you're gonna have to visit this Museum. The 
beautiful paintings. Storytelling paintings  
as well they are. There's often a message behind 
it. There is some history behind it. You're gonna  
have to check it out. I'll show you a few shots 
from the inside but, we are mainly interested  
in the beautiful people here outside visiting 
this place. There are a lot of videos already  
available on YouTube and I like to give you 
a different angle. Let's try to find some  
interesting people to interview and ask them; why 
the Philippines? What are you doing in Antipolo?  
Visiting this Art Museum. Is it the first time 
you're gonna visit? Yeah it's my first time.  
So we're making an episode, why the Philippines? 
What is so good about the Philippines? What do you  
think? Because it's more fun in the Philippines. 
It's people, it's the food and everything. Yeah  
so I've been in Southeast Asia a lot. And I do 
think... Do you love the Philippines? I love  
the Philippines. I do and I do think it's 
very... Sorry? Is it your number one Asian  
country? We've been here like two weeks, maybe. 
So I'm still exploring. But it's one of them for  
sure. Have you been to Boracay already? No we're 
going to Palawan. I'm really looking forward to  
this. I've been to Palawan. It is the best! Okay, 
okay! Awesome! Awesome! What else is so good about  
the Philippines? What else...? [She's laughing] 
You know what I like a lot about the Philippines?  
It's very original with food. I never tasted food 
anywhere like it. I love it, so far. Also what I  
like most is that the people are speaking English. 
Everyone's speaking English. And they are very  
friendly. Why do you think the foreigners are 
coming to the Philippines? Because of the weather,  
I think? Am I right? Yeah, I think so. I come here 
because of the food, that's new for me. The people  
are very friendly and very welcoming. I feel 
really welcome. Thank you so much for having us.  
Do you have a message for the world? Peace. Just 
Peace. Thank you so much. People from Manila even  
come to Antipolo to this Art Gallery because it's 
so famous. But there are not so many people to  
interview. I'm gonna walk around the neighborhood 
a little bit and hopefully, we'll find some more  
interesting people. Why the Philippines? Why 
should people come to the Philippines, do you  
think? I don't know. Maybe the weather? Yeah, I 
think. Also, the people are very nice. What do you  
think is the best in the Philippines? Hospitality. 
Do you like the Philippines? Do you like to live  
here? Yeah, Proud and loud! Proud and loud! That's 
it! That's what I hear a lot. A lot of people are  
very proud and I can see why. What else do you 
think is so good about the Philippines besides the  
food. I think that there are a lot of places that 
you can go to. Beaches and mountains. It's very  
diverse. It is very diverse. And, I don't know. I 
don't know how to say it. I'm not good in English.  
One of the good things I think is that everyone 
is speaking English very well. Your English is...  
Well, you can understand me right? I understand 
but I can't say it clearly. Okay. Well, thank  
you for stopping anyway. Do you have a message for 
the world or some wisdom maybe to pass on? World  
peace. And a good government. A good government. 
A good government. We're asking the question,  
and we're trying to find some interesting people 
Beau. Why the Philippines? Why are you in the  
Philippines? I have good friends here. Are you 
familiar with the Philippines? I am not but... Yes  
I've been here coming here 15 times or more. I've 
been traveling around southeast Asia. I figured  
that the Philippines is very different than other 
Asian countries. Indeed it is. It's a Cuba of the  
East. Cuba of the East you're saying? Yes. You 
have the Spanish tradition. You have the cigars,  
you have the rum. You have the siesta. You 
have everything. What I feel also the people  
are more outgoing here. Like they're not 
so introverted than in other parts of Asia,  
I feel. Maybe also because of the language. 
It's easier to communicate with people here.  
Do you know why? Why everyone is speaking so good 
English? Do you know? Yeah, When the Spanish left  
here the Americans took over. They made English 
the official language. What's the best thing about  
the Philippines you would say? The weather and 
the people. Do you like the food? Also that, yeah.  
It's a mixture of everything. Do you know hallo 
halloo/Mix? Do you know that? Yeah. Do you have  
a message to the world or some wisdom to pass on? 
Stay happy. Stay happy? Yes. Okay. Thanks a lot.  
Thanks for stopping and enjoying the art gallery. 
My name is Chai from the Netherlands. What's your  
name and where are you from? Harvey from the 
Philippines. Sabutan. Why the Philippines?  
Why should people come to the Philippines do 
you think? What's so good about it? I think  
it's nature and culture. I think mostly culture. 
That's what I think is standing out as well. It's  
very different. What else is so good about the 
Philippines you would say? Other than the people?  
The views. It's just nature. Everything 
is so natural. What's your favorite place?  
I think now this Museum 
because going in and out...  
It was 10 out of 10. A 10 out of 10. Yeah. I'll 
give it a 10 out of 10. So what did you like the  
best about it? Which area? The thing with the pool 
over there. The Garden. Nice one. It's good to  
know. So if you are in the Philippines and you are 
in Manila or Antipolo? You're gonna have to visit  
this Art Gallery right? It's a must! Awesome. I'm 
happy you're saying this and mentioning this. Do  
you have a message to the world or some wisdom 
to pass on? Come visit this Museum; Pinto Art  
Museum. Why the Philippines? You can actually see 
and feel that the people are proud to be living in  
the Philippines. To be a Filipino or Filipina. The 
people are so welcoming, very friendly, and very  
helpful. They've been so helpful to us since we've 
been here. There are more than 7.000 Islands to  
explore and unfortunately, we can only show you 
a little bit. We are going to Palawan. I'm taking  
you to Palawan to several beaches. It's gonna 
be a nice little getaway. Palawan apparently,  
is one of the most beautiful places here in the 
Philippines. At least that's what people saying.  
But then again, you can choose from about seven 
thousand... more than seven thousand islands. So  
it's hard to pick one. We can expect some cool 
videos to come up. We've got a friend here in  
the Philippines she's gonna marry and it's gonna 
be a traditional wedding/ a western wedding. We  
have a bit of both. We're gonna wear a barong so 
we're gonna look good on the wedding as well. I'd  
like to show you the wedding. I'd like to show 
you Palawan. I like to show you more beauty of  
the Philippines. I don't have enough time to show 
you everything. This is why I chose this way to  
show you a little bit. Hopefully, I motivate you 
to come and visit the Philippines as well. It's  
something else. You're gonna have to experience 
it. If it's not one time... This gentleman, Beau,  
has been here over 15 times. That means that he 
loves it. And I can definitely tell you; we love  
it too. Thank you for watching till the very end. 
If you want to see more of Southeast Asia? We are  
based in the north of Thailand. But we will show 
you the Philippines in several weeks. In several  
episodes. I would to say from Pinto Art Gallery 
at Antipolo in the Philippines; bye for now  
day champ! [I hope you enjoyed the 
subtitles🤗🏆, Warm greetings, Chai]
