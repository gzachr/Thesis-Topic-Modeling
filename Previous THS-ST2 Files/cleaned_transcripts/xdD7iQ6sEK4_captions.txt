have you tried max's chicken it's a
popular filipino restaurant known for
its fried chicken and they happen to
have a food truck nearby
i've never had it before so doug and i
decided to go all out and order the
crispy pata as well which is deep fried
pork trotters or knuckles
this is doug's guilty pleasure food it's
so perfectly crispy yet
tender and it's been marinated so you
get all the flavors in each bite
these are usually dipped in filipino
vinegar to brighten up the flavor and
cut through the fat
it's definitely gotta be eaten in
moderation now for the chicken
they serve this chicken with banana
ketchup which is just a slightly sweeter
version of the ketchup you're used to
the chicken is incredibly juicy and also
very flavorful with each bite i highly
recommend eating this with a side of
rice
true filipino style
