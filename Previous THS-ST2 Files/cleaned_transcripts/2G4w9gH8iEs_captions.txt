What are you thinking?
Three two one, what's going on everybody?!
I'm Xiaoma and this is John over here!
And we have got a great video...
For everybody today!!! Oh my gosh...
Alright, sorry guys!
Are you okay?
Yeah, I'm fine!
If you guys are new to this channel, my name's Xiaoma
On this channel what we do
Is we come here
To New York City's wonderful
Times Square
Where there's people
From all around the world!
You know what? I've been doing a lot of Filipino videos recently
About the Philippines
And uh, a Filipino fan on Instagram (@lance_escober)
My Instagram @xiaomanyc
Gave me a really interesting suggestion
Which was why not...
Let people in New York City
Experience some of the Philippines' amazing...
Singers!
Because actually the Philippines is known
For its singers, and...
...very talented cover bands, and all of this
He gave me a bunch of artists, and I checked them out
And I was like, wow, these people are...
Really, really, really, good!
What we have done guys
Is!
We have prepared...
...our own little snippet, our own little music video
Consisting of clips from some of the best Filipino artists
And that includes
Morissette's Akin Ka Na Lang
♫ Akin Ka Na Lang ♫
We've got...
Sorry, sorry, sorry
Maybe at the end I'll sing a little bit better!
We got Michael Pangilinan's Bakit Ba Ikaw
We got
Janella Salvador with her new single "Take It Easy"
We got Moira Dela Torre
With "Malaya"
And!
Last but not "weast"
Last but not...
Last but not least!
We got
Regine Velasquez
With her amazing...
Araw Gabi!
We are gonna see what people here think about them for the first time because
You know, most Americans have never heard
Any singers from the Philippines at all
So this is gonna be a really cool experience for them
To try!
And if you guys like this video!
Please subscribe, so I can make more videos for all you guys
Leave a comment letting me know what other favorite songs and singers and artists
From the Philippines or around the world you guys love
And want to get people here to react to!
So without further ado
We're gonna go find some strangers
And get them to react! On the channel!
Ready, ready?
Three, two, one...
Go!!!
So these are five really famous Filipino artists
Singing really popular songs
Have you ever listened to any Filipino [singers]?
No, not yet, this is gonna be our first time
Cool, awesome!
These are all...original songs 
And they're performed by them live here
[Speaking Spanish]
I got the best reactions to everything!
Cool!
Three...
Two...
One, and go!
She has a very beautiful voice
That's talent right there
She can sing!
Oh, she can sing!
Sounds like a Disney princess!
Yeah
She sounds like a...
A princess!
Yes!!!
Beauty and the Beast! Beauty and the Beast!
What are you thinking?
I feel like I should be ballroom dancing to this
That's the craziest part
She's really good, she...
Beat Mariah Carey!
Yeah
She has some pipes!
And she's pretty!
I feel like her voice all cracked...
Yo he looks like a broke Justin Bieber!
Smooth!
He's a good singer too!
Is he talking about some sad shit?
Huh?
It's sad music?
I would throw a rose at him!
Feels a little bit dated
If I heard that on the radio and was flipping through
I'd be like, I think I'm in the 90s...
He's the new Drake!
I like the melody to this one!
Yeah he can sing, I like that
Girls just flock to his feet
I mean, I'd flock to his feet...
Got kinda that soul, like [Bruno] Mars
Just cuz you're looking at him!
Maybe so
You know, but I mean...
Little bit, Bruno Mars kinda look!
Now he brought energy to it!
What do you think he's singing about?
A loved one?
Oh, she's singing in English!
Yeah
So Filipinos actually mostly speak really good English
Man: Really? Okay
Xiaoma: So they sing a lot of times in English
Nice!
Got a little hip hop with it!
Yes!
A lot of pop vibes!
Right: Yes!
Left: Very pop!
She sounds like one of the girls from Fifth Harmony
She looks like one of the girls from Fifth Harmony!
[Those] mean more
This is more Americanized
I see
You know what I'm saying?
It's dope, now!
It's really good!
Malaya
See I love that!
Yeah?
Yeah, it's real subtle, it's dope!
They all have beautiful voices!
Yeah
She looks like she's going through a tough breakup!
Real slow, steady, you know
Nice filming too, by the way!
She's like a super icon in the Philippines
She's like their number one...
Oh yeah, she's got some pipes!
Yeah, that's probably why [she's number one]
She was waiting!
Hey, whoever mixes her shit, hey...
Shit, she's in command!
She's good!
They need to come over here and become famous!
That's the Filipino icon right there!
She could be singing about like...
"That table leg"...
I wouldn't know!
I felt it in my stomach, that was like...
And she keeps it steady!
Right: Word!
Left: She keeps it very steady
Like there's no breaks...
I didn't know they could sing like that...
She has a beautiful voice
Yeah
Talking about something spiritual?
What? Uh...
Yo!
That's passion!
Yes!
You could feel it!
That's passion, you see her face?
It was good!
I like it!
I liked the first and the third one [Akin Ka Na Lang and Take it Easy]
Yeah, the first and third one, yeah
It was good!
What'd you think?
I feel like everybody had a different story to tell
It's like, every sound is different, that's what I like
But, you know [which was] my favorite one?
Was the, umm...
You know, the hip hip one?
Oh, the girl singing in English?
Yeah, the one singing in English, yeah
Yeah, I liked hers the best
Her song made me want to dance to it!
A little hip hop vibe?
Yeah...
There's a lot of potential there!
I'm gonna have to start listening to that music!
That was cool!
That was good!
The first one's my favorite [Akin Ka Na Lang]
First one
They all had beautiful voices
Yeah yeah, for sure
But yeah, when you don't know what they're saying, it does lose some of the impact
Cuz I have no idea, like...
It could be a table leg!
A table!
♫ This table ♫
♫ Was on sale! ♫
Aww, that's it?
Yeah, that's it
That was good!
Xiaoma: What'd you guys think of that?
Girl: They were really good!
They were...
They were really really good!
I don't listen to the music, but...
I would, I really would!
I really liked the first one
And the...the heartthrob, when I'm sad
And I need...some loving
I feel like I could hit him!
It's good that they... 
Show their talents on the radio
Because they can show to all of us
What they have
It's nice to see them singing
Xiaoma: What was your favorite?
Guy: The first one!
For me, the first one!
[Speaking Spanish]
Malaya
Oh yeah, really slow and gentle
Slow, yeah
I mean, I like 'em, I like 'em
There's just one song I didn't like
And the rest of 'em...
They're dope, I mean I don't even know what they're saying, so...
And which one really resonated with you?
I think it was the first one, and then...
The first one and...the third one? [Take it Easy]
The first one was fire!
First one was fire!
We got to shake the camera for a little bit of...dramatic effect!
Wow, guys!
That was fun!
We got one more question!
For John over here!
Who's your favorite?
First one, first one
But I think, I think...
But I think I sing...
Sing...better...
What?!
Than her!
No!
Alright now you gotta do the challenge, dude!
Belt it out!
Higher, higher!
Okay, okay!
