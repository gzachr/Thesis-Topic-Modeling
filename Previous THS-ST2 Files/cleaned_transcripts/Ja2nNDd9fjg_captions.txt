welcome to Manila we are of course in the 
Philippines and we're at an interesting location  
now McDonald's that might not seem all that 
interesting to you but what is so unique about  
McDonald's in the Philippines is their offerings 
on the menu yes so they have not only like burgers  
and chicken sandwiches the usual stuff but they 
also have fried chicken and they have spaghetti  
so you got to think why are they serving spaghetti 
and fried chicken in the Philippines and it's got  
to be because they're in direct competition 
with Jollibee which if you think about this  
location we have McDonald's right here and Jolly 
B writes caddy corner to McDonald's so here's the  
plan we're gonna go into McDonald's we're going to 
order hamburger spaghetti fried chicken and then  
we're gonna go to Jolly B's and we're gonna order 
hamburger spaghetti and fried chicken we're gonna  
have an old school taste off McDonald's American 
Jollibee Philippines and we'll see who is the  
ultimate fast food well fried chicken spaghetti 
slash burger joints any predictions granite  
um I think maybe Jollibee because um it 
was made in the Philippines I think okay  
got the home the home court advantage as 
they say Cedar what are you thinking about  
I am thinking about the Jollibee 
another home a home court advantage  
vote all right well you know listen I 
grew up eating McDonald's so we'll see
I did not grow up any spaghetti air 
fried chicken at McDonald's so this  
would be kind of a first count there's 
also the classic fries I don't know if  
there's veggie burgers at either one 
of these places we'll find out okay  
we're gonna find out it'd be interesting 
uh for us I know Jollibee has hot dog
McDonald's has nuggets as long as I'm wrong 
okay let's go inside like noodle Burger we'll  
go check it out stepping up to the McDonald's 
counter you can kind of see they've got these  
chicken spaghetti combos they've got King 
chicken fillets it's a totally different  
McDonald's experience than in the US okay can I 
please order then uh three chicken and spaghetti  
combos three for take away and can I order three 
cheeseburgers all right cow what do you think I  
didn't see any veggie okay there are french 
fries I don't know if one gets small and just  
compare a little just add fries into the mix 
yeah okay no let's do it all right so total  
bill for the three spaghettis the three chickens 
the three burgers the one french fry 676 pesos  
that is being uh all worked up at McDonald's and 
since we're losing light we're gonna do a little  
divide and conquer so Kelly Cedar for us to get 
away from McDonald's we're heading to Jollibee  
which I mean I tell you it's just like opposite 
Corners to order essentially the same menu uh  
and and see if they have any sort of Edge options 
for Kelly um but to Jollibee yeah all right let's  
get this done at Jolly bees now and you can see 
their menu very similar to that McDonald's menu  
in terms of like the chicken spaghetti combo 
the the burgers spaghetti it's all mixed up  
so I think we're gonna try to order this more 
strategically we're all kind of thirsty we're  
gonna get mineral Waters so we're gonna go 
with the chicken the one piece chicken with  
jolly spaghetti combo and the drink ones get 
mineral Waters so we got drinks covered and  
it'll order the cheesy Yum Burger a la carte and 
then we'll get Forest a hot dog cool and then here
well too like I started I mean I think they're 
kind of replica I think McDonald's is copying  
the Jollibee menus what I think is how the 
story goes but uh all right well we'll get to  
this all ordered up here in just a minute all 
right so it's not quite technically an Apples  
to Apples comparison because we got the water 
with uh the Jolly piece of Jollibee I imagine  
the bill is going to be more expensive it 
looks like total is 820 pesos but again  
that's because we had the water bottles 
and the addition of the hot dog so price  
comparison it's actually probably very similar 
thank you so much we appreciate it all right  
bye Jollibee all right so we got it we'll have 
a Begin The Taste session hello sir thank you  
all right well we'll catch up with uh we'll catch 
up with Kelly and Forest I think actually I I see  
them coming so yeah they're right over there and 
the plan really is to go to that park right there  
and just eat it uh in the green space so we can 
spread out we didn't want to really like bring  
McDonald's into Jollibee or bring Jollibee into 
McDonald's so uh yeah we'll head uh we'll head  
here once they catch up we'll head over right to 
the park we have got the presentation all set up  
we've got a combination of McDonald's Jollibee 
all right guys what do you want to start with  
McDonald's McDonald's chicken all right McDonald's 
chicken this is the first all-around we've never  
had make fried chicken from McDonald's cheers 
all right McDonald's Fried Chicken who knew
it's juicy it's crispy
yeah smoking hot spicy sitter 
what do you like about it um
all right and there's a cat joining us [Music] 
the challenges of eating at the park we have a  
a wildlife all right granite what do you think 
of the McDonald's Fried Chicken it's juicy egg  
crispy yeah juicy I mean it's good fried chicken 
yeah yeah all right should we immediately switch  
to Jollibee Fried Chicken yeah all right let's go 
right to Jollibee Fried Chicken that's this one  
now the Jollibee McDonald's gave us all legs but 
Jollibee gave us different cuts so I got this huge  
Lake right it looks like you got a wing there you 
want to trade sure okay you took the leg you got  
kind of a uh maybe a breast piece there all right 
everyone Jollibee Fried Chicken here we go [Music]  
how does that compare to the McDonald's 
there see the Jollibee or McDonald's  
you like the Jollibee what is it you like 
about it um it's not that crispy okay that's  
what you like you like it's less crispy all 
right granite what about you um it's like
like hot and like um not that juicy yeah it's 
a little more dry than the McDonald's I agree  
uh which one do you prefer McDonald's I think 
I might go in the McDonald's Camp as well it's  
just a little juicier I like the breading of the 
Jollibee but the chicken's just a little bit drier  
what's up next uh we have the 
spaghetti and the hamburgers
me want to go spaghetti Forest you want 
to try some of this spaghetti [Music]  
um how was it good it was good all right well 
so far Forest likes for uh what happened to  
your hamburger eating the bun oh there you go 
okay so now it's gonna be a Jollibee spaghetti  
versus McDonald's spaghetti and I will say 
the Jollibee spaghetti is more visually  
appealing than the uh than the McDonald's 
but I'm open let's give it sure we'll get  
their Fork let's go for the McDonald's 
first McDonald's it's a white cheese
the cheese is sweet yeah it's a sweet flavored 
what do you think it's something that's yummy  
and sweet at the same time okay so you 
like the sweetness of the sauce and the  
cheese Cool all right well yeah I mean the 
McDonald's spaghetti it's good I I would eat  
that as a regular Academy what about you guys 
definitely over here to the Jollibee spaghetti  
now there is uh sausage hot dog chunks 
in the Jolly Beef spaghetti in terms of  
which one's more hearty you might go 
with the Jolly Beach just on the fact  
that has the meat chunks all right 
you guys ready yep Jolly B spaghetti
whoa that is definitely a different 
sauce uh also sweet a very sweet sauce  
but that is a totally different flavor to the 
McDonald's yeah right there buddy therefore  
steal your stuff yeah what about okay so 
Forest I believe is a fan of the Jollibee
is that so yummy Forest uh-huh nice Cedar 
what about you how's the Jollibee spaghetti  
all right you're going with McDonald's spaghetti  
this one the one the Jollibee one to me 
almost tastes a little spicy there's like  
a little something to it a little kick 
so yeah I'm gonna go uh back in on this  
Jollibee spaghetti I I like I think I would lean 
towards the Jolly Beef spaghetti over McDonald's  
it's just something about something about 
the hardiness of that spaghetti I mean  
it's almost like a chili sauce on top 
on the Jollibee spaghetti Sam I like it
yeah I'm not complaining on the McDonald's it's 
just a little more thin than McDonald's sauce  
okay everybody well so Jollibee has some votes 
McDonald's has some votes but it really comes  
down to the Burger now granted your burger looks 
like a an interesting scenario there Jollibee  
this is our first time eating Jollibee Burger so 
none of us have had this before well Forest has  
happened now a jelly bean bun okay so Jollibee 
Burger yeah that's just I was gonna say it's  
um definitely like a cheese and a 
mayonnaise on the inside I don't  
see like pickles or anything like that 
yeah or onions or onions okay so I got  
yeah cheese in a kind of a mayonnaise probably 
like a secret sauce manners yeah yeah yeah  
it's uh I'd say it's sealed up okay you 
guys ready for this the Jollibee Burger
yeah there's definitely a mayonnaise on 
that it's a cheese mayonnaise [Music]  
it's a good burger now this is one that we are 
definitely familiar with the classic McDonald's  
burger no real surprise here on the McDonald's 
classic burger Granite what's on the inside there
onion cheese ketchup pretty good all right 
guys does it tastes like the U.S McDonald's
it's got that totally recognizable 
McDonald's flavor on the burger
all right granny which one do you prefer the 
Jollibee burger or the McDonald's I think  
Jollibee because I it's got like more flavor to 
it and the McDonald's one's a little dryish wow  
and upset in my world so jolly be over McDonald's 
burger Cedar what are you thinking I'm thinking
me like the McDonald's is more dry than the 
Jolly Pizza you know what's interesting you guys  
this might be our triple upset I am also leaning 
towards the Jollibee Burger something about the  
mayonnaise on that burger makes it like you guys 
are saying a kind of extra juicy on that bun and  
the P the beef is a bit thicker I think than 
the McDonald's Patty so you're getting kind  
of more of a Hearty burger out of Jollibee so 
wow three Americans all preferring the Filipino  
cheeseburger from Jollibee Kelly how you doing 
with those french fries sweetheart okay I got two  
two french fries two french fries 
and I'm willing to share them okay  
okay I do want to do the taste off so 
we got a McDonald's versus a Jollibee
now it tastes like a normal 
french fry okay from McDonald's
that recognizable McDonald's flavor recognizable 
but it almost I think I prefer the crispy fry from  
Jollibee what upset again Jolly bees man getting 
the job done I don't know it tastes like a it  
has just like just a little more hint of I don't 
know flavor or crisp crunch okay okay you want to  
get in on this McDonald's french fry taste test 
so good all right I know you've been waiting so  
we got the McDonald's on the Jollibee all right 
okay all right a little skinnier the Jollibee one
the Jollibee one's better because the McDonald's 
one doesn't have that much taste okay so maybe  
maybe the jelly beans are more salty would you say 
nice all right well holy cow this is uh this is a  
quite shocking developments the the popularity of 
the Jollibee the cheeseburger upset and now fries  
so Kelly and Cedar both prefer the Jollibee 
fries let's see granite in on this action of  
course you want french fries you take one go ahead 
bud there's a McDonald's fries and granted you can  
mirror this one oh he's going Double McDonald's 
all right this one's McDonald's yes that's the  
Jollibee you're eating no this one's in a donut oh 
oh boy all right go for it that was the McDonald's
okay tastes like the McDonald's fry you've 
always known that's a jelly bean mm-hmm
I say Jollibee because it's got like more like 
flavor okay all right well so everyone has voted  
for the Jollibee the the Jollibee french fries 
I'm gonna totally give this a try okay all right  
Kelly so I'll go I'll go obviously McDonald's 
I could probably guess how I'm blindfolded
that's a McDonald's french fry yep 
Jollibee and then the Jelly Bean  
man I know there's it's subtle it's subtle 
it's subtle they're pretty much IB again  
they're pretty good competitors maybe you 
need five more of each okay it's pretty good
pretty good
I don't know man I gotta go 
McDonald's you're going McDonald's  
it's not a total sweet but uh thank you for 
me then that I I think uh I think that was  
a quite shocking Development question 
yes was there meat in the Jolly beet  
spaghetti yes there is meat in the Jolly Beef 
spaghetti it's like a hot dog bites hot dogs  
so what what about McDonald's at all do you want 
to sample the spaghetti I can't compare it because  
I'm not yeah I'm not going to well this will just 
read this is like a first reaction because we've  
never had spaghetti spaghetti from McDonald's 
so here you go this is the McDonald's spaghetti  
reaction spaghetti is always fun to eat on camera 
right it's just so messy so messy there's no Grace  
going on on this one no Grace oh man it's 
a really long doodle yeah it's a big noodle
that is good it's good it's sweet yeah it's nice 
it's not like Italian salty it's more like a sweet  
sweetness to it yeah it's pretty good I don't 
know why I we all we all leaned Jolly Beach  
because at least for me it was a bit more hearty 
oh right but the McDonald's I mean that's more  
of a traditional flavor than I would recognize 
you know what I'm saying it's it's sweet but  
it's it's not so different than like the American 
nice spaghetti that I grew up eating 1980s 1990s  
right where the Jollibee is much more hearty 
very good yeah all right guys so all in all  
chicken spaghetti burgers are you happy with 
the Jollibee experience yes it's pretty good  
hot dog uh well a forest has not 
gotten very far into the hot dog
horseback all right [Music] all right 
everyone so that is a look at McDonald's  
versus Jollibee a few upsets in the mix but 
wow that was pretty good all in all I would  
eat at McDonald's I would add jollibee's all 
over again how about you guys yeah thank you
wow what an endorsement all right everybody well  
agilica of the taste test uh from the American 
perspective comparing the McDonald's to the  
Jolly bees yum yum all around and with all that 
being said we'll see you in the next episode
[Music]
