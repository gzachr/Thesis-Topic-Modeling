It's similar with korean 빠다코코낫
its butter coconut
there is 빠다코코낫 snack in Korea

almost same
It's sweet unlike the view
there's sugarcoated on surface
sweet~
Coconut scent is better than Korea's Pada Coconut is different with korean's
anyway it's good. originally it was good
and familiar
but korean 빠다코코낫 is more like elder-favorite flavor than younger
sugar is well coated even inside
its from oversea so package quality is bad
and easily broken
It will be good with coffee
My mother eat 빠다코코낫 with coffee
It will be good with coffee. Its sweet

Too much in my mouth
Okay. butter coconut biscuit it taste like korean 빠다코코낫, but it have strong coconut flavor.

Package is 5x2 = 10pieces
there is cream inside in picture
lets check what this is. open up
I have to break this to 3 pieces with one line
there is long line on bisquit
I thought it was a biscuit, but it's high density. plenty to eat
I think I'll full when I eat this
You can eat it as a meal replacement.
You can see cream cheese inside. Its dense
As you see there's cream, Its really creamy taste
Really. What should I say? milk cream or vanilla cream
Its really cream and tasty
But Stiff
If you don't care it will break into little piece and going everywhere.
so take care
whoa look at this
full inside
Its unusual it filling full
I feel fruit flavor

I think so
I milk milk flavor.  milk flavor cream
I think south east asian snacks will unfamiliar
Its familiar taste. we eat this kinds a lot. Its full
We ate skyflake cracker sandwich
Its really good
Each piece have high density so its not empty.
It will be full when you just 1 bag. I enjoyed
It's really creamy
And last one! honey graham cracker
열 pieces. 10 pieces are here
lets look at totally description there is honey picture
honey picture, honey snacks
snacks with honey. lets get this
It feels like strange
it looks fragile

I have no idea where is honey. just eat
why i cannot feel sweet
Plain. little bit
건빵 taste we ate at military service
ummmumm 건빵
sweet 건빵?
Its coffee snack
you must need coffee. Its really plain and dry
at first there was honey picture so it will be sweet. but
Just biscuit . little sweet
Package color is chocolate so i expected that flavor
But its basic. real basic
but I can feel a lot of calories
But there is a little smell of honey..
I thought similar food.
-건빵
-not 건빵
-what food is similar
-smell
Without thinking just drink a cup of tea and eat this
its not spicy and salty so it will be last longer
It's not irritating.
Korean adults don't like being provocative.
Adults will like this with coffee

Can u smell of diffuser?
-i can't
-why it doesnt smell?
-how was it?

I thought it would taste because it's a cookie
Most of the sweets were dense compared to Korean sweets.
When you eat, you can feel full

Each has its own personalities
Many snacks you can eat for your purpose

There were some plain cookies for tea time
Even the snacks themselves are delicious.
