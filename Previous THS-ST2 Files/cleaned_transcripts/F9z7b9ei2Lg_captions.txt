good afternoon everybody so now we're at Market 
Market here on the outskirt of BGC and today we're  
on a mission because today we're gonna try 
one of the most famous popular Filipino fast  
food chain but from a Twist it's like a Pizza 
Hut but this place is called Greenwich it's  
a pizza place fast food so we're here at Market 
Market so we're just trying to find the entrance  
and then we're gonna try this exciting Filipino 
fast food chain uh I believe it's on this side  
yeah so it's our first time trying uh Pizza in 
the Philippines actually especially for me I  
personally can only think about pizza like fast 
food pizza as similar to Pizza Hut so I cannot  
imagine anything different than Pizza Hut so this 
is my expectation right there Pizza Hut level  
okay hey don't have surprise or expectation 
otherwise that's true I think in my years of  
travel has told me one thing is to set no 
expectation for nothing then you won't get  
disappointed or you won't get excited at all 
it's only when you are there and then you'll  
find out what it's actually like all right 
so we have arrived the entrance right here  
Greenwich wait Alina is always so scared of 
everything and she would keep saying means  
like means like so scary I don't know why I'm so 
scared and Justin asked me to go like a scary room  
you know where is there yeah people usually scared 
you so we do have plans to go to one place called  
nightmare Manila yeah a child I guess I will 
be crying security hello so for those of you  
who don't know what uh nightmare Manila is it's 
basically a haunted house in Manila and we plan to  
go there one day to subscribe now if you want to 
watch that episode where I keep getting jumpscale  
Alina start crying baby baby I think it's on the 
right side so just saying we had a bit of a scare  
because we searched Greenwich on Google Maps and 
he only look at us in England I think yeah is it  
is this like a UK chain or something because 
yeah so strange um oh Greenwich is here over  
here so it's right next to other fast food chains 
Greenwich it's like a green witch like a witch no  
different spelling but oh so it's kind of like 
like based on a manual first impression it's uh  
they have Fried Chicken's here it's everywhere 
fast food chain you go in the Philippines you  
will see a white chicken wait but just before we 
go in looks like there's something going on here
looks like there is like a dress Festival this 
got Queens Bloom Festival so many princesses  
reminds you of Disney yeah
yeah I'm not very into fashion in general 
so when I see clothes I'll just walk past  
normally but I know for Elena she likes 
Fashions a lot because she worked in a  
model industry before fashion today it's 
okay it's okay today holiday today holiday  
anyway let's head into Greenwich and 
see what's the deal about this place
I know usually pizza place around 
the world in Australia it's I think  
it's harder or less people who eat Hawaii in 
general more people prefer pepperoni but it  
seems like here in the Philippines see the 
big one the big photo it's already called  
Hawaiian overload I like Hawaiian yeah 
you wanna take that one the 259 pencil  
mix every different day I don't think 
so I don't think it's very common okay  
let's see all right let's have a look at the 
menu first and I send yeah so we don't block  
anyone okay wait so basically on this side based 
on so I'm just reading off what I see on the menu  
right now so there's overload the big pictures 
and all in or in could be a mix of all the  
ingredients based on my understanding my guess uh 
and then Classic Pizza cheeseburger cheeseburger
they take everything from friction
spread across uh cheesy bacon and ham that 
sounds like Hawaiian but with no pineapple  
ham and cheese ham and pineapple that's just 
Hawaiian no what's the difference between oh  
I see Hawaiian overload has some green stuff 
Hammond pineapple classic don't have see it  
look yeah there's some green stuff over there 
it's like capsicum maybe here don't have though
like a set like this because it says good 
for two people yeah so we can get a set I  
don't know if we can finish it because 
in general we have small eaters but uh  
looks like there's an Overlord bundle fried 
chicken with pizza okay let's take this bit  
okay all right then okay hi uh can we get 
one overload bundle for two please okay
look at that I remember that in Pizza Hut usually 
you can get only one pizza for 800. really yeah
two chicken two iced tea and like big pizza 
yeah to be honest a bundle that costs around  
a little bit less than 15 Australian dollars 
pretty good deal if you eat it in Australia  
I think it's gonna be over 20 or even 30 30 
Australian so yeah it's the value but I think  
so far this is the most expensive one let's not 
be happy maybe that can't go bad right lasagna  
and Hawaiian pizza I think I have quite a bit of 
expectation for pizza in general but I want to  
tell you guys a story when I was in kindergarten 
my teacher would make us pizza in kindergarten  
and I don't know why but in on Pizza there is peas 
like green peas and like it was disgusting it was  
just like the worst Pizza I had it's haunted my 
memories ever since in my childhood trauma I don't  
know but it's so disgusting I remember always when 
I was in kindergarten when I don't like something  
when it's macaroni with soup and everything you 
know the likes of it I would just pour it into my  
no the Highlight is I'll pull into my school 
bag so I don't have to eat because I cannot  
leave until I cannot leave until I eat 
everything so I just usually pour the  
soup and everything inside my school bag and 
my mom when she opened the bag I was like oh  
my goodness what's going on here so smart baby 
I think compared to the biggest pizza place  
in like fast food in Australia usually there 
is Domino's which is similar to Pizza Hut or  
similar to Greenwich here in the Philippines 
but uh Pizza the indominos is around usually  
if you get a special coupon there will be maybe 
around 259 but this is a regular set in Australia  
it's only if you get a coupon but on average 
I think it's around 10 Australian dollars yeah  
that that amount but yeah here are the I think 
the difference is also here they serve fried  
chicken and so on I think that's very common 
in other countries uh oh it's two two sets wow
I thought it's one I'm gonna share one wow that's  
awesome okay all right let's let's try 
it I I wonder how different this Fried  
Chicken is compared to the other 
fast food chains how's the iced tea
that so sweet
it's okay maybe it is
yeah just now we missed number because uh 
usually quite a number or I think you should  
just now open the machine no just now heard 
machine saying like oh they're called a number
maybe I'm hallucinating then but uh this 
looks good all right let's dig in so on  
the menu today on the side dish we've got 
some fried chickens and I believe this is  
like a bread maybe like a cheese stick 
and also called lasagna and we've got  
some icy here and we're just missing 
the pizza which is coming along soon  
all right let's try this let's try it okay let's 
try it uh let's start from lasagna okay because  
I'm a fan of lasagna oh I'm gonna be transparent 
with you guys I've never been a fan of lasagna I  
don't know why but maybe my friends I always go 
to his birthday party and when I hit the lasagna  
I don't know why it's natural reaction yeah 
I remember when we lived in Seattle I give
yeah there was a takeaway that was good let's see  
if this one matched that uh that 
one right there okay that's right
feet
mushroom inside okay one two three
excuse me that's all right thank you thank 
you thank you that looks good it was you were  
already in my mouth okay one two three this

I think I'm slowly getting used to 
lasagna I think I'm used to its face
people I don't know why but I didn't like the 
layers I felt like it was just eating flour but  
now I'm kind of used to it it's like eating a 
lot of pasta with that Wally used for us bread
[Music]
it's really cool I think my patient was there 
just now kind of important but it has increased  
a little bit good so for Today's Pizza we've 
got a Hawaiian overload pizza with pineapples  
and cheese and capsicum I believe now I'm 
so thinking are you meant to dip the into  
this stick into the gravy because it's for the 
chicken oh you're right don't forget rice sauce  
right yeah oh I finished mine already you finished 
your stick I think it's for fried chicken though  
it's a mushroom oh really mushroom sauce 
give those Rye if you know it's rice it'll  
be so nice it's like Julie beef mushrooms 
it will be rice a little bit too much yeah  
I'm sure too much coughs okay time to 
try six people looks delicious yeah so
you juice juice
I like pepperoni the most 
all right let's get this bye
[Music]
what do you think I like it well what do 
you use backpack like food Hawaiian pizza  
I think it's even better than uh Pizza Hut 
because Pizza Hut it's first it's expensive  
if you pay 300 they give you like 
this size this is beautiful yeah
no wonder it's so popular 
well we didn't know about
because for me pizza I should be taste the 
same everywhere so I was just thinking like  
what's like you know how different can it be 
but it's actually a pretty good pizza I think  
in my opinion the only thing that I could 
compare with Pizza Hut is the cheesy crust  
if they're cheesy crust then it'll be perfect 
I don't know if you just ordered extra cheesy  
because I'm not too sure I need to find out I 
can say I like because it's fluffy it's like uh  
it's like this you have a inside so we have 
some new pizza I tried before it's so thin
you know Gordon Ramsay would say if foreign
I think Philippines always has its own version 
of fast food that is more affordable and quite  
tasty to you know I don't eat this one 
because I just have it I don't eat this one  
this is my favorite particular
ly
yeah
it smells like fried chicken okay give a try
I think it's okay just fried chicken 
yeah it's usually inside from the way  
around so it's well cooked but 
it's just fried chicken I know
what yeah yeah not bad the thing that I find most  
intriguing after staying here in the 
Philippines for six months is that
they'll be Filipinos love their friends which ones 
tastier Marina or this one no debate about sorry
I'm trying to deepen the sauce 
as well the mushroom sauce
foreign
I know what you mean yeah I like my my 
food has a mix of different texture and  
flavor oh run some example will be will 
be adding your potato chips into ice cream  
yeah McDonald's you just 
quite interesting taste rice
combinations are there check check
no I mean other than fries and like shakes 
fries and oh yeah keep their fry butterfly  
flies into the shake it's so our dressing just 
in chicken monster already eat food chicken yeah
it's a monster [Music]
thank you very much oh roadblock all 
right thank you thank you very much
oh I'm so full yeah it was really feeling 
I didn't expect that I thought I would come  
here and I thought we were just like yeah I 
don't know overall mixed review for me I'm  
very surprised I'm I can say it's uh better than 
McDonald's in Philippines I kind of agree let's  
make a ranking what do you think fast food okay 
for me I guess I'm I'm not fond of manganaso  
but I still love it because I think this is for 
me number one wow pretty much number one okay I  
don't remember the bad give me five second is a 
second all right yeah and no no no jolly beetle  
Jollibee second okay three ISO and that's 
it get all three only yeah I can give you  
guys a top buy for me I think okay all right 
so number one for me it's always gonna be my  
I'm a big fan of it uh second I think would be 
I think on my second might be trolling B second  
will be jolly B third for me will be Greenwich 
yeah for me yeah ciao King will be number four  
number five I think yeah but I think yeah my 
favorite part about grooming today was I was  
generally surprised by the portion for 500 pesos 
you could get for two people it's very generous  
and you can get pizza at such affordable 
price it's a privilege to be honest yeah
lucky let's come here today yeah 
I think it's time yeah I think  
it's a really good experience very 
feeling welcome to your Vlog hello
yeah that's the thing when we always 
go and uh Vlog people always say hello  
very kind yeah yeah and she was 
so shy distance all right anyway
