We got Chippy, barbecue flavor!
We got...

And the one that I went all the way back to the Filipino supermarket to get
Just for you guys who requested it
Was the...
Nova Country Cheddar flavor!
Let's do it!
Eh?
This is so exciting...
I'm gonna take the big one!
That's a 10!
That's a 10 for you?
Why?
Barbecue's just...
I can't even taste the barbecue really
Do we have different tongues?
I don't taste it
How much barbecue do you need?!
I'm gonna go with a 4
4...
A 10
It's a 10!
I don't think they're good barbecue chips
No
There's not really barbecue flavor
Right: I can taste the spice a little bit...
Left: It needs more flavor...
But...they're still good chips
Maybe you could be a food critic!
Five out of ten!
I would eat them
I would give it a four...
If they were at a party I would still eat them...
Go for it
It's spicy, I like that
But this one will be a 7
Because I'm not a huge fan of barbecue
But I like the spice so that's why it's a 7!
They're good, they taste like...
Like chips here!
Okay
They're good
Yeah
8!
Sweet!
[On the packaging:] "Made from 100% real potatoes!"
As opposed to what, I don't know...
That's the real question!
I don't know!
What, what?
You think it's spicy? I don't think it's that spicy...
Not spicy, it's just not jiving with me though
Why?
Just got some weird flavors
What's this one called?
Girl: I kinda like that one!
Xiaoma: Vcut, Vcut!
Vcut?
Yeah
What's the...seasoning?
Barbecue
Just barbecue?
Yeah 
Doesn't really taste like barbecue
Girl: But I like it!
Guy: Yeah, doesn't taste like barbecue
This is a 5 for me!
I'll go with like a 6, 6.5!
Cheers!
It's pretty good!
I guess I was expecting it to be spicy but it's not
I was too
I feel like they're not as salty as actual Cheetos
Guy: Yeah, it's like a sweet Cheetos
Girl: Like I'd still eat them
Yeah, it is sweet!
This is great, I like it
10/10!
I'd do 8 out of 10!
Do you have anything spicy in there?
Got an interesting texture I think...
I would say this...
I would give this one a 9!
9
Why?
I like cheese!
Cheese ring?!
Yeah
So...
Rings of cheese...
Rings of cheese...
It's like a sweet cheese puff!
Yeah it's like a mixture between
A Funyun and
A Cheeto!
I kinda wish it was a little cheesier though!
And then what would your rating be from 1 to 10?
Like 5 or 6?
6
Just let us know what you think about that one
This is good!
It's a little different than a Cheez Doodle [American cheese snack]
Like I don't know...
It's a little like...
The cheese...just tastes a little different!
Okay
Tastes a little cheesier, I guess
But it's good
6!
What?
Guy: I don't know if I've had...
Girl: Not my favorite!
No?
Similar to a Cheeto but sweeter!
Giving it a 7!
4
4?
I don't love it, yeah
Alright next up, we got the Chippy
Tastes just like a Frito!
Like it tastes just like a Frito!
Yeah
And then what would your rating be
9, I guess?
9, nice!
They look like Fritos!
Yeah
Oh, these are good!
Oh these are better, I like them!
These taste really like Fritos
Yeah
Wait, I want another one
I'd say 9 out of 10
9 out of 10
I'd go 8 out of 10 on this one
8 out of 10!
Tastes good, I like it
8!
Xiaoma: 8, cool!
Guy: It's good!
It's like a weak barbecue Frito
Yeah, I just don't like flavors like this
I hate Fritos
I like 'em
Feel like I could eat a lot of these
6 or 7
Guy: 6.5?
Girl: Like 4.5?
4.5? Wow
I don't know, I don't like 'em
10!
This definitely tastes familiar, it tastes like...
The Frito-Lay Fritos!
8?
8! Cool man
Oh, these are cheese, I can't eat them
Oh, you could give them to me!
They're good!
They look like the Baked Lays
Yeah, now that you said that...
Yeah, they do!
I'd give it like a 5 out of 10
This one is good, but I'll give it a 7
Yeah
I prefer the other one
The corn one, that's better
They're not bad, so far all of them are good
It's like a Pringle covered in cheese
I'd say a 5
Cool
[On the packaging] "Revolutionary Cheese Flavored Potato Chips"
Xiaoma: It's hexagonal...
Guy: Interesting!
It is hexagonal, yeah
These are good
I would give this like an 8 too
It's not too cheesy, like it tastes like a chip
Like with maybe just a little cheese
So I like it
Guy: I was about to say I haven't seen a chip like this...
Girl: That looks like umm...
Something I know...
Baked Lays, maybe?
Yep, exactly!
I'm not feeling this one!
No?
No
Kind of bland
I crunched into it expecting a Baked Lays flavor
Right
But I didn't get the Baked Lays flavor
This is a 5 for me also
I'm also a 5
It tastes like regular...
...cheese!
I give it 9!
You like that?
Yeah
How about this one?
This is my favorite
It's called Sweet Corn
And we'll see if you like the corn...
I'm okay with corn, but let me see...
This one is good!
This is a 10!
I love this one!
It has a sweet and salty flavor, I like that
It has a good mixture of both of them
I like this!
I have a feeling this one's gonna be good
Oh weird!
I feel like I haven't had anything that's ever like a corn flavor...
This is probably the most different thing I've ever had
I don't think I've ever tasted anything like that
It tastes like I'm eating corn of the cob
But instead it's an unhealthy fried ball
It's like...
A chips version of Pops cereal
Totally, right?
Yeah, it is
No, that's weird
But I like it!
And then what would your rating be?
I would say 10 out 10 because it's something I've never had before!
Yeah!
I'm going with 10 out of 10 on this one
10 out of 10!
Sweet Corn!
That's the one!
Oh I like these
I feel like they'd be really addictive
I'll give them a 7 out of 10
Kinda like those sweet cheese balls!
Xiaoma: Sweet cheese balls?
Girl: In the big jars?
They're good
Right: I would buy these
Left: It's confusing though because I expect it to be cheesy
6 out of 10!
Oh I think I'd like this one...
Why would you think that?
I love corn
It's just like corn!
It tastes just like corn!!
Yeah that's strange
I like it!
It's confusing!
Nine!
Xiaoma: Nine, cool!
Girl: I like it
You know what this tastes like?
What?
You ever have that cereal Kix?
Oh, yeah
Like cheese puffs
Yeah, they look like cheese puffs, for sure
We'll see what they taste like
Yeah
Oh
Very corny
Not in a [bad way]
But you can taste the corn
I'd give this about a 7 too
Not bad though
Interesting
So it tastes like corn?
You'll find out!
Wow!
It does taste like corn!
Yeah!
Mom: Like a kernel [of corn]?
No, like corn!
Like on the cob!
It's good though!
I like it!
I'll give it a 9!
Cool!
It does taste like corn!
Right?
Oh my goodness!
 That is so bananas
 Yeah
I mean, it's so corn
We got Sweet Corn!
Sounds good
I like that shape
We got the balls...
Grab a ball, sweetie!
It tastes like corn!
Tastes like cereal!
Like Corn Pops!
Yeah yeah yeah!
Actually a lot of people compared it to cereal today
Like Kix, like...
Kix, yes!
It's good, it tastes like cereal, not chips, but...
I'd give this one a 6
5?
It tastes like legit corn
Yeah, yeah
Like straight corn
Not too bad
So this one is called Nova
It's like a multigrain, but cheese flavor at the same time...
This one will be a 9
I like cheese, but...
The flavor could be better
But this one is good
Oh this one is cheese too actually
Actually...
Maybe you could just try
This is the Nova chip
Those look like SunChips!
They do look like Sun Chips
They taste like SunChips
I wish they were cheesier though!
I'd give them 5 out of 10 too!
Five
I like it...
Six
Reminds me of a Sun Chip!
Yeah, a little bit right?
Yeah
I'll give it a 7
This is a multigrain country cheddar snack
A lot of cheese
Related...
Yeah I don't know why, Filipinos are really into the cheese flavored snacks
For some reason
It's good, yeah
I'll give it a 7
Okay, cool cool cool
Tastes like a Sun Chip!
Sun Chip, yeah!
Not much flavor
I'll give it a 6, there's not much flavor
But it tastes like a Sun Chip
Right
Five
Dude!!!
That was fun guys!
You know what
It was really fun guys, 'cuz...
The one that it seemed like people definitely...
People liked the most today
Was...
