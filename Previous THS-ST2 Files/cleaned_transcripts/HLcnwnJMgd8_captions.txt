Why’d you have to wake me up?
Oh, that’s right, because it’s time for an amazing video!
Okay guys
Sorry about that, I was just taking a little nap
In this beautiful sun in Washington Square Park
You guys remember that we made some recent videos
That were very fun
Where we asked people here in New York City
To rate the appearance…
Of famous celebrities in the Philippines
Males and females
And those were both very amazing videos
If you haven’t watched them yet
You can click over here and watch those
Okay!
But some of you guys requested…
Actually a bunch of you guys requested
That I take a look at…
The famous Filipino love teams
And I thought this was really interesting
If you’re not familiar with love teams…
What love teams are…
They are like teams…
They’re couples in the Philippines where like…
It’ll be a guy and a girl
And they get together
And they make movies and stuff
And a lot of times they end up becoming couples
In real life
So I took a look at these Filipino love teams you guys sent me
And I was just looking at them and I was like…
Wow, these are the most beautiful couples I’ve ever seen in my life
So I thought yes, this would actually be a really great topic for a video
So, what we’ve done today guys, is
You guys gave me a list
Of really famous Filipino love teams
Which I have compiled…
Here!!!
We’ve got, as A…
We’ve got LizQuen
For B, we’ve got KimXi

Got the beautiful JaDine!
For E…
We’ve got MayWard…
Last but not least…for F…

So what we’re gonna today, is we are here in…
New York City’s famous Washington Square Park
And so we’re gonna go up to some strangers
And ask them today what they think about these love couples
And see who they think is the cutest
For me personally I think they’re all…
So gorgeous that I can’t even pick one
But John, what would you say
Xiaoma: Is the cutest out of them?

Guy: Oh, well her mom thinks it’s B!
You think E?
Yeah
Wait, I think…
I would say them too, D [JaDine]
D, you think D, yeah
I guess we all think D then!
Why does everybody think D, why do you guys think D?
They’re happy, young, they have a ring!
They’re matching, she’s showing the ring!
They look alike!
And anyone else have any opinions?
I think we all like D!
Everybody likes D!
I was thinking about A, but…
No, they look like high school sweethearts!
They look the least happiest, dawg!
That’s your favorite? F?
My mom likes [KimXi!]
My mom has a shrine of them in their house!
I like B, sorry!
B!
No way!
Because my mom likes them, right?
Wait wait wait, what’s your YouTube?
Xiaomanyc
So it’s X-I-A-O-M-A-N-Y-C…
Oh you’re golden dude!!!
You’re golden, you’re golden!
Let me click the bell…
I would say B
B, why?
They’re so cute!
They look happy!
I like A!
A?
The same thing she said
Why, cute and happy?
E!
D?
E!
Why?
Cuz the girl is cute!
Yeah!
I pick C!
I pick C!
You pick C? Why?
Because they just look happy!
They look happy?
What’s the question?
Who’s the cutest couple?
Them!
D!
And B!
D and B? Why?
They look…wait…
Her smile looks a little bit…off…
Her smile looks cool?
No, it looks a little bit off!
They have the best suntans!
You like the suntans?
F looks happy [KathNiel]
I choose…
They look like friends
I choose these two!
A and C? Yeah [LizQuen and AlDub]
Cool
Sweet, well thank you guys so much, really appreciate it
Thank you!
Cutest couple?!
Yeah…
This is interesting, because we might have different opinions on this
How much time do I got to look this over?
However much time you want!
Oh Jesus, wow
Some of these guys look exactly the same
I would say either B or F!
B or F?
Yeah
Why?
I don’t know…
[KimXi] looks really happy, and [KathNiel] just looks really sophisticated
They look kinda fake happy, honestly!
B?
They seem really sophisticated, like…
I would say A, because they seem a little more casual
They seem younger!
Well, they’re not like trying to hold each other too tight…
It’s just kind of…natural
That’s true
So it’s kind of like, just seems a little more genuine
[KimXi’s] squeeze right there
Just…I don’t know, that’s not…
A little too extra?
Yeah, it’s just like…you know…
Especially kind of his smirk…
Oh, okay
She’s more into it than him?
Probably, like he’s just…you know…
Cool, sweet
And [KathNiel] looks like a wedding photo, they’re like, I don’t know…
Already married?
Yeah, like…
Man that’s hard, they’re all cute!
I like these two!
B and D?
Yeah, I like C…
You like C, why?
I don’t know, she looks really approachable, and like…
Really pretty, you know?
I also like E
You like E?
Why?
You like everybody!
They’re more representative of the community I think
The Filipino community
I still do C! [AlDub]
Okay and your [final vote]?
I’d go with E, sorry! [MayWard]
I changed my mind!
Cool!
You got any thoughts?
Yeah, I have an idea
Yeah?
Yeah
I’ve been kinda leaning towards D, but umm…
You went D, I went F!
F, why?
I could see F!
You know, it’s probably an aesthetic [thing]
It’s probably because they’re darker
To be honest with you
That’s my reason
D [JaDine] is almost like a balance between slightly more sophistication with F [KathNiel]
But like, more casual with A [LizQuen]
And so, D’s almost like that “in between”…
Kinda casual but not super casual
Got the blazers, the unbuttoned shirt…
Yeah
Like the nice crocheted sweater…
Interesting…
And they look young and happy
[MayWard] looks more thoughtful here
And like, the seductive type, so…
I think they seem a little bit more approachable in that sense
Right
Wow, guys, that was so much fun!
Thank you for suggesting this great idea to me!
Uh, because I thought that…
This was a really interesting video…
And I don’t know, I think it’s really hard to say who’s the cutest…
I think they’re all really very cute celebrities, and…
I think that Americans today had really interesting…different thoughts!
And so I thought it was interesting to see who they thought…
Made…
I think people had a lot of like really interesting…
Sort of idiosyncratic reasons
To who they thought was cute couple
Which I found very interesting
And umm...
