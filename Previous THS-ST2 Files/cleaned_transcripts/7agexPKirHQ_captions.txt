www.filipinawives.com.au - for Australian
Filipina couples
Down Under Visa is my calling.
It's not just another way of making a living.
One of the wisest decisions I
ever made was deciding to find someone worth
marrying in the Philippines.
I didn't find the right Filipina
lady straight away, but after a few failures
I definitely struck gold.
And I'd like to think most of our clients
come to us for visas when they've also found
themselves a gem of a lady.
Biggest issue?
For me and for everyone else I know?
Cultural differences and the misunderstandings
that come from how differently Australians
and Filipinos look at things.
There are some differences in
Filipino culture and Filipino thinking that
we get and which we appreciate straight away,
obviously.
Gentle, caring and sweet ladies who treat
you with kindness and patience and don't make
you feel guilty
for acting and thinking as a man?
It's not bad at all!
But I think we know all that.
I don't mind bragging about my good fortune.
The point is that I believe in
marriage and I believe in families, and sound
marriages and committed couples lead to strong
families
that produce well-balanced children who will
one day go out into the world and build their
own great
families.
And I like playing my part in making this
happen.
FilipinaWives - Jeff Harvie's pet project
When we first started Down Under Visa it was
motivated by a desire to help other Aussie
men like
myself who had met wonderful ladies in the
Philippines already, and to make it happen
that their ladies
could settle in Australia with them.
That was my dream.
And business took off right from the start,
although I didn't start off only with partner
visas or visas for Australian Filipina couples.
I took whatever
came along, and that included work visas and
everything else that I could do.
I had to earn a living after
all.
But I have to say that I wasn't overly inspired
by that type of work.
Hey, I'm sure I could sell sausages
if I needed to, but it's not something that
would give my life much purpose.
And honestly, neither did
work visas.
So it was actually on a plane trip from Manila
back to Australia after a fairly thankless
series of meetings
that I made a firm decision to throw all effort
into partner visas for Australian Filipina
couples.
Because
yes I DO care very much about these couples
and the outcomes of these applications, plus
I also have a
great deal of experience in this area.
I'm married to a Filipina lady after all,
and I've had experience with
Filipino culture since the 1990's.
And we went through the visa process ourselves.
So I basically designed
the FilipinaWives site in my head on the plane.
And part of that plane trip was me deciding
to make that focus clear, and to show not
only my expertise
but also my caring and concern for the success
of Australian Filipina relationships by offering
insight into
how to make these relationships better!
Knowledge is power, and successful marriages
depend on
couples who understand each other as well
as they possibly can.
Not easy to do that if you don't know
how each other thinks and feels, and how their
family and upbringing shaped their thoughts,
feelings
and behavior.
Now I know that I didn't know squat about
Filipino culture when I first came here.
Not sure what I was
expecting, but when the doors of Manila airport
slid open and I stepped out into the noise,
smoke and
confusion it certainly wasn't that!
Photos are two-dimensional, and they don't
contain noise and smell.
I
was thinking of swaying palm trees, cool drinks
and pretty girls.
I was right about the last one, but way
off track with the rest.
And know what else?
Because I knew nothing about the culture,
I probably ignored some of the nicer
girls I was writing to in favour of those
who knew how to say what I wanted to hear.
Yes, I was as silly as
every other lonely and naive Aussie man who
makes his way here.
I had no innate wisdom, rest assured.
I made stupid choices, and I whilst I was
no bar-hopper or playboy I knew so little
about the culture here
I may have messed things up with Miss Right
had I met her at that point.
So what's FilipinaWives all about?
It's not dating advice.
We don't get into that at Down Under Visa.
We don't matchmake and we don't
give any dating advice whatsoever.
What I like to do is to share my experiences
with life in the
Philippines, with Filipino culture, and with
being married to a Filipina lady and with
raising Filipino kids.
What makes me qualified?
20+ years of experience with Filipino culture,
several failed relationships and one wonderfully
successful
meeting and marrying of my soulmate and watching
my life evolve into something wonderful that
would
not have happened had I not met and married
Mila.
I also live here and have been here fulltime
for
more than 7 years.
Plus, I started with one daughter who came
as part of the single-mum package to a
house full of noisy and happy kids.
In fact my first grandchild was born just
two weeks ago, so the tribe is
growing.
Plus of course, there's you, dear clients!
There's all of you, with your experiences
both wonderful and
sometimes not so wonderful.
We don't advise on relationships, because
it's not what you came to us
for.
There's also a lack of time.
So we get on with bringing you all together,
and with getting you the
partner visas and tourist visas (and child
visas and citizenship applications) that you
came to us for.
And
we observe.
Hard not to.
But we do our best indirectly and impartially
to help you to understand each
other better, thus this post.
And why am I posting this today?
Because I want those of you who haven't visited
and scoured the articles on FilipinaWives
to please do
so.
It costs you nothing.
We won't sign you up to pyramid schemes, and
I have no books or DVD's to sell
you.
I just want you to read my articles and watch
my videos and to learn more about each other's
cultures so you can understand each other
better than you ever did, and I want you to
go on to live
tremendously happy lives together and raise
dozens of kids.
And if you wish to name any of your kids
"Jeff"?
Please feel free!
