Hello
Hello
Finlay arrived at Suite
Woo
Suite with Queen size bed
The hotel welcomes you with fruits and chocolates
The most important thing is the rinse!
Main and other toilets for guests
There are two separate balconies
You can see the pool and the beach
At night the atmosphere is fairy
And when the rain comes down
The restaurant services are tired and I describe them
They offer you a wide variety of food and desserts or drinks
Try it all during your stay
All are fresh!
From BORACAY manga
Prepared by the chef "Alan"
