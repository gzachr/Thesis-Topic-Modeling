wow there's a pinakbet inside today i'm going 
to try making some exciting pinakbet variations  
i love pinakbet one of the amazing vegetable 
dishes of the philippines and so today  
i want to try making some variations of pinakbet 
for fun i wanted to cook filipino food for my  
brother but instead i thought it would be 
nicer if we cook filipino food together  
so we will start with the regular 
version of pinakbet and later there  
will also be a bonus challenge for 
you we'll be cutting some pork meat
we'll add the pork meat
and it's a really sunny weather today really 
nice okay so i'm gonna add some boiling water
a little bit extra i'm gonna 
just cook this meat first
so the pork meat is almost ready so we're 
going to add a little bit of oil something  
we'll be adding the onions 
i love this ilokano dish  
adding some garlic and also um ginisang 
baggong this is really good for pinakbet so  
some at the background sometimes you can hear the 
uh the chicken the manok like in the philippines
we're adding a kalabasa pumpkin
so i reduced the heat a little bit guys because 
otherwise it would have burned the pork meat i'll  
be adding a sitaw as well but not another lot 
because we're gonna keep some for the the next  
version of pinakbet smells amazing and we'll be 
adding some talong a few pieces of talong which  
gives it a nice color it's almost time to cover 
this we're adding some okra and spring onions and  
then later my brother will make a hundred percent 
vegan pinakbet so i i know for sure that some of  
you like vegan food and we thought it would be 
nice to try a filipino dish with a twist making  
it a hundred percent vegan do we have a lovely 
uh okra here i'm gonna add a few pieces of okra
a little bit of uh and a bit of spring onions so 
it looks so nice with all these colors and i'm  
just gonna cover it for a while briefly until 
the vegetables get a little bit soft and then  
we're done there we go this is our ilocano dish 
pinakbet okay so this is the original version  
my brother will now try a totally 
100 vegan peanut bet what is this  
olive oil okay so what is next next is the 
garlic garlic garlic and onions smells great
so you can see that he's doing a different way  
different version he's frying the 
talong adding a little bit extra oil
and calabasa
so what is that there's a spicy lemon pickle oh 
don't put too much because i know this is actually  
very spicy it's really spicy yeah that's 
good it's good to keep it thin it's made of  
lime it's a lime sambal add the string beans okay 
sitaw in the philippines they call this sitaw yes  
always good learning sitaw is a 
nice good but it's also very healthy  
and gives a nice green color oh it's gonna be 
so spicy okay so what is the next step next  
step is the okra okay so we're gonna add the okra 
basically it's quite similar as what i did but uh  
this one is 100 vegan because it doesn't 
use any bacon and also it doesn't use any  
baboy add some tofu okay so you always 
drip i thought there was nothing like  
meat you know but there's still uh gonna be tofu 
which is maybe like the replacement for the baboy  
a little bit of tofu some extra filling i 
hope you like this uh totally vegan pinakbet  
so the my brother's vegan pinakbet is ready i'm 
drinking some coffee and then we'll quickly go to  
the next one i'm gonna try a really uh exciting 
uh experiment for pinakbet i'm gonna add some  
rice flour sticky rice flour i'm gonna try making 
a buchi which is the first time for me ever to  
make which i added some some water to this so 
we'll be adding two tablespoons of sugar to this
okay i will also add a little bit extra rice 
flour to make it a thick sticky dough getting  
nice and sticky do you like buchi i really love 
butsi let me know in the comments if you like  
buchi okay we have the rice rice dough ready for 
the buchi and also some sesame seeds and water  
with a little bit of rice flour so i add a 
little bit of the rice flour to the water  
we will just mix this so i add a little 
bit of oil to this let's just uh knead it  
making buchi balls now so they might be a little 
bit big but uh they get a little bit flat with  
the warm weather so we're gonna quickly 
fill them with the pinakbet and then fry  
so you might wonder how we will 
fill them with the pinakbet  
i have the pumpkin here and some pork 
meat that i just take out of the pinakbet  
string beans so basically all the flavor of the 
bagoong is already in there so what we will do  
we'll just chop the vegetables a little bit and 
we still kept a little bit of a bite with these  
pumpkins so they're not too soft 
which will give it a nice texture  
this is going to be exciting because i don't know 
how this will turn out i'm taking a little bit of  
a risk here so basically i just take the dough 
and fill it with some pieces of pumpkin seed
and some pork meat just a little bit of 
pork and then we're gonna just fold them  
hope it will work out guys turn it into 
a bowl i really hope this will taste good  
and then put it in the sesame seeds there we go 
that should be our first pinakbet buchi they might  
be a little bit big but that's okay because um i 
needed to keep them a bit bigger for the filling  
uh hopefully they help they will 
keep their shape there we go
this might be a very nice uh 
idea for your uh magnegosyo diba
surprising it's really nice oh it has a really 
nice texture so it's the soft texture of the um  
sticky dough with the uh pieces 
of vegetables inside really good  
so here's the challenge for you please try 
to make this at home okay so make a buchi  
and a pinakbet and put it inside and see how you 
like it i'm really curious um how you would like  
this dish i just made it up myself it's an 
invention i'm very excited to hear from you  
use the pinoy planet hashtag please let me 
know how it goes okay so my brother is going  
to make a final dish with the pinakbet with the 
vegan pinakbet it has an egg flour and water  
so we added some oil to the pan so we'll 
be adding the pinakbet to the batter  
and then mixing it okay and then 
we will add this mixture to the pan
we'll be adding a little bit of okonomiyaki sauce
a little bit of mayonnaise
so how does it taste show up set up so i hope you 
liked this video and i look forward to your buchi  
uh comments and also for this one okonomiyaki if 
you want to see another pinakbet that i made you  
can watch it here and i'll see you next time 
with more filipino food maraming salamat po
