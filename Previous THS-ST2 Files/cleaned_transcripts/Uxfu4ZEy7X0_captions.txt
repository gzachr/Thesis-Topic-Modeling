Hey guys!
Welcome to the Philippines Paradise! Good Morning!
It took more than 20 hours to get here:
3 flights, a car trip,
a boat trip but yeah, it was worth it.
Don't know if you're following me on instagram
but I've lost my voice these past couple days
and I haven't been able to speak with you guys until now.
But since the flights were awesome and we flew business,
my first business flight
where I could lay completely horizontally...
We shooted some footage, here's a sneak peak!
Hi guys, welcome to another video...
I can't...
This was our flight Chef.
He presented us the menu
and got our orders.
When you fly business there's a lot of these kind of perks.
You're welcomed with a drink,
with a hygiene pack that contains
a sleep mask
a foldable comb
socks
ear plugs
toothbrush and toothpaste
moisturizing cream, lip balm and a shoe-horn.
Overall, the most surprising thing
was beeing asked if we felt sleepy...
We were watching movies
when suddendly asked if we want our bed made.
We got it made with a pillow and a blanket
and the chair was layed down horizontally.
Whom ever tried this, comment down below!
And comment about the food!
This food deserves our attention!
It's delicious!
It didn't seem airplane food, if you know what I mean!
We're talking about meals with appetizer,
main and dessert...
and real cutlery!
If you have the same itinerary
don't forget
to check in again when you arrive to Manila
because you'll be changing airlines.
We've read these can be challenging 'cause Manila's
airport is quite big and people lost their flights because
got distracted with time.
It's simple guys!
After getting your bags or backpacks out of the belt
just get an elevator to level 3.
Here we are waiting for our third flight!
We have one hour
I'm on my laptop
I'm gonna edit the Azores travel vlog thumbnail
I know it was supposed to be out on Wednesday
and got your messages...
It's just that I couldn't speak and had to record the
voice over... it got delayed.
Atually in our way here
I really wanted to speak more for the vlog
at least on the 2nd flight
it was so awesome,
we were able to lie down completely.
It was my first business flight with this feature!
Super confortable!
I would easily get used to it!
Obviously!
But I couldn't talk, you guys!
Now, I kinda can...
but in these past hours
I was really 100%  out of voice.
Daniel was happy
that he got to be free from earing me talk
and put up with me...
There...
Now we're heading to our final destination
I was reading your comments and
no one got it right!
Not even one!
We went to buy a SIM card as I finished
the thumbnail very quickly.
I wanted to have internet without blowing my roaming.
We got a Smart SIM card with 16 GB
which was 1000 php... around 17 eur.
And also,  to change money!
I was reading your texts...
We're almost there!
After the 3rd flight
We drove for 2 and a half hours to get here...
and now we're going on a boat to the hotel.
Nearly there!
We arrived around 3am
I must confess
I felt overwhelmed with the room
it's way better than the pics on booking.com
We were welcomed with flower necklaces,
an immersion bath with flower petals,
fresh made juices in coconuts...
Amazing!
Till this moment right here... 10 points!
The room is amazing and the resort aswell
We're staying in Badian Island Wellness resort
located in an island - Badian island
And we've only known the room and the breakfast area...
that's it..
We've arrived at 3 am
and couldn't fall asleep
6am and we were still wide awake
It's called jet lag!
It's 8 hours difference
and believe me... it's not easy to adjust!
In Thailand we thought "This jet lag thing is kids talk"
Here? Forget it!
Earlier around 1 or 2 am in Portugal
I couldn't stay awake here...
had to take a power nap!
It's super hot
but also a beautiful day!
Time to explore the island
and show it to you guys!
I've seen beaches on the other side od the island
the pool is cool
having a pool in your room... amazing!
But this is the Philippines
we have to go to the beach!
