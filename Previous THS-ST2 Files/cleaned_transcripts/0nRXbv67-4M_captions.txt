hi my name is josie and we are now 
in the poblacion area of manila in  
the philippines you'll have to watch to 
see how we ended up here but we started  
in the salcedo saturday market this morning 
where we tried some award-winning street food  
the market is a community market that's over 15 
years old and it's grown and grown over time then  
we head to poblacion a vibrant local suburb right 
here in the heart of manila let's go and explore  
the philippines so welcome back or welcome if 
you are new here my name is josie welcome to my  
channel we are on the way to the salcedo saturday 
market here in makati manila in the philippines i  
have no idea what to expect let's see what's 
around and let's go grab something to eat but  
first we're on the way we are walking so let's 
see a little bit of what mccarty city looks like
so we've got about another 800 or 
so meters to go another kilometer  
it's quite warm today actually but it's um the 
first blue sky there's the first blue sky today  
it doesn't look like it's gonna rain but you 
never know last night it absolutely poured  
on us when we're at the mall of asia um but 
we're just heading down here i'm starving it's  
probably around way past breakfast time 
so let's keep walking and get some food
so that is a jeepney so it's kind of 
almost like a song towel or like a bus  
or something like that and you can catch them 
around the city but i believe you kind of have to  
know where you're going or tell them where you're 
going and we don't know where to tell them to go  
so they run a designated route but you 
have to know where you're getting off  
yeah and the difference we don't know where we're 
getting off so oh we're gonna cross the road  
but they're all around here and they are you can 
use them to get around as well if you want to
okay it looks like we're 
coming up to the market now  
this is really exciting it looks really 
fun there looks like we're ready to be like  
little jars of food and things so 
let's okay let's go read i guess
all right so we've gotten here there seems to be 
just stalls around the market and lots of little  
ones set up inside there's like a little park here 
as well and also markets on the outside on the  
side of the road also i'm not sure where to start 
so we're walking past all these markets just at  
the front and we saw one called like an ube cheese 
pancake or something and i ordered it and then i  
realized i have no idea what that is so i'm going 
to have a quick look we've googled it the pancake  
is indonesian pancake now the pancake style is 
indonesian pancake but the ube is filipino right  
filipino like yam or it's dessert made from boiled 
and mashed po mashed purple yam perfect all right  
let's try it so it's really interesting because 
i'm seeing lots of fruits that i've noticed from  
thailand like we have like long kong durian 
jackfruit ramptan obviously they're not just for  
thailand we're in philippines but it's just 
interesting seeing familiar things because now i  
know what they are but you have heaps of different 
fruit you also have like plants here things that  
you can take home like food you can take home 
food you can buy so we're just having a look all  
around the outside and then we're going back for 
the pancake because it has to be cooked so we're  
getting three pork sticks for 100 pesos and they 
like grill it on the bbq the thank you they grill  
them out the back on these barbecues and like turn 
them they marinate them they chuck the marinade on  
top they cook them all up turn them over make 
sure they're cooked all around and this is what  
you end up with and i'm telling you now i know 
you can't smell this smells absolutely delicious  
my mouth is salivating waiting to eat these so 
let's see how we go these ones are the pork ones
okay hold on
i love the marinade marinade is like sweet honey 
i'm not sure what it is but it's really nice it  
makes a pork taste so good maybe it's not 
teriyaki it's sweet something but the pork  
itself is a little bit um a little bit chewy not 
as soft it smells so good super sweet but i'll  
tell you this for aussies watching the kebabs you 
buy from woolies they cook on the barbecue at home  
the beef ones it tastes like that 
hey it might be a bit of teriyaki  
it's really sweet i'm having another one that's 
how good they are the more i'm having on this  
they're like more tender it is that's really 
good this one's really um really soft and tender  
we have to go back for that pancake now so so 
while we're on the way back to get this pancake  
if you're new here if you like my videos 
consider pressing the subscribe button
consider pressing the like button only if you 
like my videos but let's go have a look at this  
pancake and let's try it cheese pancake very 
interesting let's go with your barbecue potted  
yeah it was delicious everyone here is so friendly 
i love it okay so this one is so interesting i've  
never seen anything like this before you can 
see that it's a pancake it's a really thick cut  
pancake it's purple i guess that's where like the 
yam comes into into play and then you've got like  
the layer of cheese on the inside all right let's 
try i've never seen this before ever in my life  
oh why do i like this this is so cool oh wow wow 
whoa whoa it is so good the like cheese like melts  
like a really nice kind of cream cheese 
sort of flavor the pancakes a little bit  
crispy on the outside obviously from when they 
cooked it i don't know why i like that so much  
it's cheese and pancake why does it work 
i like this it's my favorite so far today  
all right let's feel good that's incredible the 
pancake is genuinely so fluffy i can't explain  
on camera how fluffy the pancake is i feel 
like if i dropped it it would bounce back up  
into my hand because this is like so absorbent 
it's like super fluffy oh this is the best mmm
oh good all right so i see it's so hot today 
this is probably the hottest day here since  
arriving in the philippines i'm gonna 
grab a watermelon juice it looks so fresh  
so they poured the watermelon juice into the 
cup and it was 60 pesos for this large size  
of watermelon juice hopefully it's nice and 
cold because it is a hot day today um they had  
different flavors there as well they had like buco 
and melon what's buco bako tell me in the comments  
below if you know what that is i've never heard of 
that before let me try this watermelon juice that  
tastes like a full-on watermelon they've juiced 
a watermelon there well of course they have it  
i know but it literally if you taste a watermelon 
it's exactly what it's like you know how sometimes  
you have juice and it tastes like sugary 
or sugar syrupy it just tastes like water  
so i was walking past those crabs and i saw that 
they were named male and then a different name and  
i asked him if it was female but he told me that 
there um there's actually three genders of crab  
and that was the third one oh oh oh that movie 
oh yeah you notice that the apron is conical  
the apron is uh yeah i say a little bit wider ah i 
see that was really fun to know but here i see uh  
lumpia shanghai which i think i don't know 
about the actual official list but i think  
one of them says it was voted the best street 
food it was we won a street food award last  
year where it was number one and tied number 
one with another filipino dish that we haven't  
had yet that we'll try soon because this was 
number one so we should try it all right i  
don't know what it is but let's give it a go can 
i get a uh olympia shanghai i love you online
uh do you want three for 100 yes please 
thank you so much thank you thank you  
all right i'm gonna try this best street food 
item she said there's pork on the inside so that's  
interesting it smells like that it smells like 
there's like a it's like a meat wrap which i guess  
is what it is let's try it tastes like a like a 
floppy sort of cold spring roll version yeah it's  
a version of it which makes sense it's really the 
first thing that strikes me is like pretty oily  
and really like floppy and cold so you're 
like not crispy like a normal spring roll is
like a dim similar spring roll mix 
together there's veggies in there as well  
might be a bit of carrot or something there 
so the veggies in there alongside the pork  
pretty cool snack okay just to walk along 
with i'll say my favorite of the day so far  
by far was the pancake what was yours 
the pancake yeah the pancake was so  
good but we've done like a whole lap basically of 
this square around the park that has the market in  
it so let's have one last look and then i think we 
might head to grab another coffee grab something  
maybe else to eat there and go from there because 
it's really really hot right now let's get moving
so we're in the more of the publishing area now of 
mccarty it's more aware i feel like if you're like  
backpacking mostly you'd come here i've heard it's 
a little bit of a cheaper budget um but there's  
more things here there's like bars coffee shops 
like nightlife and things like that but we haven't  
been here before this is a different part of 
manila that we haven't explored yet let's go have  
a look and see what's around this way i really 
need a coffee so let's go find one and then find  
some more food so this is a tricycle we haven't 
gotten one yet mostly because i don't think  
will fit but it's another way of to get around 
kind of like a another tuk-tuk kind of thing  
but you have to be quite small to fit 
in that and i don't think i qualify
okay got my coffee so i actually ordered from 
grab um this coffee shop um the other day and i  
quite liked it it's in such a really cute cup 
it's like short and it's just really cute and  
it has like a flip cup because we know that they 
don't have like many plastic straws around here  
which is really cool and i kind of liked it so 
we decided since we're in the publishing area  
that we'll come and actually come to the 
shop and try it out it's really small in  
there um so i couldn't fit the camera in 
actually i would sit for a second and have  
a have a coffee that's the story 
of my life actually having coffee
pretty good fresh and cold we've been walking for 
quite a while um that's a pretty good coffee so  
tell me what your favorite coffee shop is here 
in the philippines or in manila all right let's  
sit here let's finish this coffee and then we 
might find lunch um we might find something  
maybe mexican maybe feeling some quesadillas or 
something like that so stay tuned to find out what  
we have find out where we go and we'll see when we 
get there so it is raining right now so we might  
just wait a second and then we'll head on but it 
might actually be refreshing to walk in the rain
so we're here in el chupacabra and you may 
be wondering why are you eating mexican  
spanish food if you're in the philippines 
well besides the fact that it's delicious  
the philippines was actually colonised by 
spain for almost 500 years to my understanding  
so there's actually a lot of spanish influence 
everywhere in the city in the names of the streets  
you might notice that this suburb itself 
is called publicion and it even goes all  
the way to people's last names are also kind of 
spanish the spanish also brought christianity  
which is pretty much the dominant religion 
here in the philippines still to this day so  
that's why there's so much mexican and spanish 
food all throughout the philippines so that's  
why filipino culture has like a lot of spanish 
influence to it which i found pretty interesting
so that is the end to another amazing day here in 
manila the philippines i am so excited i have been
