Good afternoon from Bohol, Philippines, where today,
I feel like going on a motorcycle adventure, guys,
but the problem is,
look at me, just walking around with my two strong legs.
The problem is, I don't have a motorcycle,
so that's what I'm gonna try and sort out right now.
I've pre-booked a motorcycle from
some business around here.
It might be right there.
I don't know, there's no sign
saying the name of this business.
They say "Motorbike for rent."
So I'm just following Google Maps to the business that I pre-ordered from,
which was Bohol Bikes.
Is this the Bohol Bikes?
Bohol Bikes, no?
Eh, I think it's further up.
What is it?
Oh, you have another business?
It's okay, I pre-booked already, Bohol Bikes.
Nah, Bohol Bikes, not you?
Another business? Okay.
Yeah, I'm trying to make sure I get the right one because
the one that I pre-booked had really good reviews and stuff so
that's the one I wanna take.
Although the one that I pre-booked is more expensive than that guy's one.
That guy was charging 300 per day and I think I'm paying 400 per day.
How are you? Hi.
- Hi
Okay.
Sir, can I have, have a selfie?
- How are you? Okay.
Okay.
One, two, three.
I'm a subscriber
- Oh, okay, good.
I'm looking for a business called Bohol Bikes.
Up here somewhere, Bohol Bikes?
Maybe there's the other ????
No, according to Google Maps, it's around here.
That guy down there, he says it's not his business.
What the name?
It just says Bohol Bikes Motorcy...
Bohol Bikes, Motor Bikes for Rent.
Bohol Bikes.
It's supposed to be up there. I will look.
- Yeah, maybe.
Thank you, bro. Thank you.
Okay.
Yeah.
Oh, here we go. That's it. I see the sign actually, guys.
Right here, Motor Bikes for Rent.
That's the name of the shop, Bohol Bikes.
It says, book online.
That's exactly what I did. I booked online.
Hey po. I'm Dale.
I booked for today.
Ah, you're Dale?
- Yeah, you sent me an SMS asking where I was.
I was sleeping. That's where I was. I was sleeping, po.
Yeah. So it's now like,
well it's well after 1 PM, so I've left it a bit late,
to I've got fully exploring today, but I'll do a full exploration tomorrow.
Today I'll just go around this Panglao.
Today I'll go around Panglao.
Yeah, so we're in,
we're in Panglao, which is a very small island
that's connected to the main Bohol island by a bridge.
That's where my resort is. That's where I'm staying.
And, yeah, it looks like you can just get around that island,
Panglao, in about 15 minutes or something.
It's that small, so maybe that's what I'll do today.
And then I think tomorrow I want to go and see those
chocolate hills that Bohol is so, so famous for.
Registration is here.
- Ah, okay, lots of room here. That's good.
Oh, yeah, I was going to rent
a rain jacket as well from you, right?
I think I booked that online. You do rain jackets?
Ah, rain coat.
Yeah.
Hopefully I don't need it. Hopefully I don't need it.
- Why?
I say, hopefully, hopefully.
I hope I don't need it, but
I will take it, in case I need it.
Yeah. Okay.
- I will keep in there.
That looks good.
Fairly new bike, right? You say it's 2019?
Yeah
- Yeah, so only 4 years old.
Here the brakes.
It's a front brake.
Ah, okay.
The rear.
Yeah.
Good.
All good.
Yeah. It's in good condition. I've had,
I've had some motorbike rentals where, you
know, the brakes have been a bit loose and stuff.
It's been a bit dodgy.
Low tread on the tires, etc. This is one of the better
bikes I've ever ridden, for sure.
Yes.
And when you start, yeah.
- Yeah?
Press it and then...
Yeah, like that, yeah. Okay.
So, I'm paying 400 per day plus 100 to
rent the raincoat, which I hopefully don't need.
But, just in case.
If I'm like 2 hours drive away from a
hotel and it starts pouring down, it's gonna be
very handy. Thank you, so much.
Hi, how are you?
- Hi
We have a friend.
- You look familiar to me.
Oh, good. Nice to see you.
Dale Philip?
- Yeah, yeah. Okay.
I just came to rent a bike.
Ah, okay.
- You're working here?
Before.
- Before?
Actually, I was before I was
expecting you that you will visit here this, yeah.
Why? Why you expecting? This shop?
Yeah, yeah, this shop.
- Ah, why?
Actually, I'm one of your followers.
Ah, so you're working at this shop?
Yeah, before
- Ah, before? Ah, okay, but you...
Did you read the, what do you call it? The reviews?
Reviews, yeah, I read the
reviews. Yeah, that's why I chose this one.
Because it was next to my...
Just remember my face.
Some of our clients post my face there.
Face there?
- It's my face.
Oh, on Google reviews.
- Yeah, Google reviews.
Ah, okay. I will look later. Okay, good.
Nice one.
- Yes, nice to meet you.
Yeah, thank you.
Nice to meet you too.
I'm gonna take this motorbike.
I need to find a helmet that fits though.
The black one was too big.
That's what she said.
I'll try this red one.
Actually sir, they are all the same sizes.
All the same size?
- Yes
Why, you want the lady size?
- Lady size, no.
He insults me, he said "You want a lady size?"
- Actually that's okay.
Yeah, that's better. It's less loose.
Yes, that's better. Yeah.
Which one do you like, the colour red or the colour black?
Well, he's already given me this one, so.
We've tested it out. We've tested it out.
So I get the black bike with the red helmet. That's okay.
Black and red, those colours go together.
- It's better if you will choose this one. This is the newest.
Oh, it's the newest one?
- Do you like new or...
Yeah, of course I like new. Why is he giving me the old one?
Why is he giving me the old one?
Just use this one.
The colour red.
You telling me I should get this one, to match the helmet?
Ah, yes.
Ah, okay.
Just look at the, what do you call this one?
The mileage.
Only 2,000.
- Only 2,000?
Okay, so this is this year.
No, last year.
We bought that one last year but...
- It's hardly been used?
Ah, okay, so I got upgraded.
Good.
Fantastic. Oh, the raincoat.
Yeah, the raincoat's in this one. I almost forgot that.
Again, hopefully I'm not gonna need it but...
Yeah.
- How many days you will stay here in Bohol?
I will stay 5 days. This day 2.
And then you will rent 2 days only?
- I've rent this for 4 days.
Oh 4 days.
- Yeah.
I was the one who made this one.
This is the place that you must visit here in Bohol.
Ah, okay, you wanted to take a picture of this? Ah okay.
Because I know you have no idea or you have no further idea about Bohol.
Yeah, I have no idea. I just know the chocolate hills.
I've never had a bike before
that has one of these phone holder things.
It's secure, yeah?
- Yes
Let's see. Hopefully it doesn't go flying.
Okay, yeah, it's secure.
It's screwed into... Most of your customers are using it.
Yeah, it's good.
I've never had that before, so that's good.
Really? This is your first time to drive a motorbike with...?
Yeah, every time I rent a motorbike they never have that.
They never have it. I have to keep stopping and
checking my pocket for the phone, you know?
Okay.
Nice to see you.
Dondon.
- Dondon?
My nickname is Dondon.
Dondon and you are?
Dariel.
And Dale Philip.
Dale Philip, yes.
So what time do you close?
- 6 PM
6 PM? Okay, so on three days
from now I will bring back before 6 pm.
Okay, thank you so much.
I'm gonna set off now.
Okay guys, thank you.
See you.
Oh, wow.
Oh, this bike is good guys. This bike is good.
So according to Google Maps it's about
20 minutes drive away to this food park where
I'm gonna get my lunch.
And as you can see guys, look, there's
many rickshaws, Indian style rickshaws,
here in Bohol that you can use to get around.
But hey, much better to get
around on your own bike, isn't it?
I like this. The roads are so quiet.
It's so easy to ride.
They're nice, they're flat, they're
big, they're open, the traffic is light.
It's all good.
Okay, down the side streets now guys.
This is a nice, nice residential area.
I'm passing a lot of nice houses around here.
Nice and peaceful as well.
Okay, this should be the place. In fact, this is the place.
Fort Ridge Food Park, right there.
It looks quiet and I can smell the food.
I smell burgers. I can smell somebody frying up burgers.
Hi.
- Hello, our parking area for the motorcycle there.
Oh, it's another place for motorcycles?
- Yes.
Ah, okay, where's that?
Over there.
I don't see any other motorcycle.
Oh, it's hiding behind there. Okay, I will move it. Okay
Pain in the ass.
Dunno why I can't just park here, because it's empty.
There's like two vehicles in the whole park.
Well, unfortunately guys, this has
turned out to be a bit of a fail.
They're playing loud, loud, loud commercial music,
which means yer man can't vlog in there for copyright reasons.
So I'm just gonna go in and buy a
drink, use their restroom and I'll go somewhere else.
But I think I have to pay this guy for the parking.
And it is starting to rain as well.
Hopefully this day doesn't
turn out to be a complete failure guys.
Let's see how it goes.
I have to pay for the parking?
No, sir. But we have an entrance ticket, sir. 50 pesos.
50 pesos entrance ticket?
Yeah, but 40 pesos, consumable inside.
Ah, okay, I will do that.
50, and I get my ticket. Okay
40 pesos consumable.
Okay, thank you.
- Thank you, welcome.
Hi, how are you?
Okay, let's check this place out then.
Okay, well this place is dead anyway, guys.
Look, there's like all these stalls.
They're either closed or there's nobody working at them.
So maybe this is like an
evening, maybe it's like an evening thing.
I'm just gonna keep talking so
that the music doesn't catch onto my video.
I just keep blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah.
But yeah, it's just restaurants and
stuff set amongst this kinda like lake area.
It's nice enough but it's
probably like more of a night time thing.
Maybe they've got like a live
band or something like that, guys.
But I'm gonna have to spend my voucher on a drink.
Hey guys, how are you?
Okay, they've got some fresh juice there.
I think that's what I'm
gonna do after I use their facilities.
Hey sir.
- Hi, okay.
I've done my business but I'm going back straight out.
Can you guess why? Can you guess why?
If you've watched previous
vlogs from me, I think you might know why.
I have left the darn keys in the bike.
Okay, thankfully they're still there.
Okay.
Hello
- Hello, how are you?
I saw your vlog.
I saw your vlog.
- You saw my vlog?
Okay, Dale Philip.
Okay.
Indian.
Okay, I want to get a fresh
juice from your "Thirsty Juice Shop."
What kind of juice?
- What is the best one?
Best seller.
- Okay, I will take a...
Only shake is available sir.
- Pineapple, pineapple.
Pineapple shake?
Yeah, shake is good. Yeah.
What size sir? XL?
Small, small.
Normal, normal.
This the small one.
This small?
Okay, that's fine.
How much is the small one?
Five five sir.
Five, five? 55?
- Yes.
I can use this for 40, right?
So I give you 15 more.
Okay, so 55 for a small pineapple shake.
40, you add 15.
We're getting fresh pineapple, blended with ice cubes.
Oh, what was that?
What was that?
Ice, sir.
Ice? More ice? Ah, okay.
Ah, good, nice and thick.
Here, sir.
- Okay, awesome. Thank you.
Thank you, sir. Okay.
- That's 15 and the token is for 40.
Thank you. Cheers. Oh, nice and cold.
Just what I need. Just what I need.
I need to cool down, guys. It's...
The humidity, the heat and
humidity, even though it's raining.
You see the rain and you look
at this scene and you think it's cold.
No, it is roasting.
It is roasting. It is so humid.
Yeah, this looks like it would be a good place,
if everything was open and it was more lively and stuff.
I think, uh...
Yeah, it's definitely a night time spot.
Probably not somewhere to come at this time.
Right, I think I'm just gonna hide under
here until the rain stops, if it will stop.
I dunno if it will stop.
It might just rain all day, who
knows? But I'm gonna just chill here for a bit.
Finally, guys. Finally, finally,
the rain has stopped. It's still drizzling a wee bit.
There is still thunder. We
might get soaked on the way back.
But on the way back, I've discovered there's a
couple of, you know, interesting spots I might want to visit.
I was looking at the list of recommended
places to visit, that the motorbike rental place gave me.
And, yeah, on the drive back from here,
there's some cave with stalagmites and all that
that might be worth a visit.
There's some museum with
shells, you know, like the sea shells.
They have, like, really cool ones, big ones, fancy ones.
That might be worth
checking out. Both of those things are on
the way back to my hotel, so
I think that's what I'm gonna do.
I'm just gonna start heading back to my hotel.
I'll visit those two places, but, yeah, guys.
The main reason I got this motorbike was I want
to visit these chocolate hills that Bohol is famous for.
That's the number one reason for coming to Bohol.
It's one of the most, you know, interesting
geological formations in the world, the chocolate hills.
So, yeah, that's gonna be tomorrow.
Hopefully, if it's dry, I'm gonna try and time it right.
I'll have the motorbike parked in my hotel and
I can, like, you know, just wait until the sky is blue
and I know it's gonna be dry for a few hours and then...
And then I'll go for it.
But for now, I'm gonna get
back on the bike and head to this cave.
Hinagdanan Cave Cave may close
within one hour of when you arrive.
Okay, we should be close, according to Google Maps.
It should be in here.
I don't know if all these
people are coming for the caves or not.
It looks a really, really busy area.
Yeah, I think it is all for the caves.
All this is for the caves. There's souvenir shops and stuff.
This is a bigger thing than I thought it was.
I thought it was like a little thing.
It's like a big, big tourist attraction.
Right, where do I park this bike?
I don't know if I can just park in here.
Hey guys, parking where? Parking?
Parking?
- Yeah, in here is okay? Okay.
You go there, the parking pay here.
I have to pay there?
- Yeah parking pay.
Here, I have to pay?
Parking?
- Okay, this is it.
He's telling me there, okay.
Are you the Facebook vlogger?
Am I the Facebook vlogger, which one?
With the voice.
- With the voice? Luke Damant?
Yeah man, can I take a photo with you?
- Yes okay, okay.
I take a photo with you?
- Okay, nice one.
Can I take photo?
- Okay, I'll park my bike. I'll park my bike.

Nah, I don't wear jewelry.

Oh, it doesn't scratch?
Ah, okay, I don't wear jewelry, so it's okay.

What's that?
Yeah, I don't wear jewelry, so no, thank you.
Yeah, it's nice, but I don't wear jewelry.
Nice.
Oh, your teeth are jewels as well.
Silver, silver.
- It's stainless now.
Bling, bling.
Okay, we're getting a photo? Okay.
Okay.
- Good. Okay, nice one. Okay.
This dolphin brother.
What's that?
Dolphin.
- Dolphin? Oh, it's nice.
It is nice, bro, but I just
don't wear jewelry, so I don't want it.
This silver.
- Huh?
Silver.
- It's nice. It is nice.
Sir, I have baby.
What's that?
Baby.
- Baby?
Yeah
- You're trying to sell me a baby?
Oh, you're telling me that you have a baby? Ah, okay.
No, I don't want it, bro. I just came to see the caves.
Sir, a good price. Okay, 100.
- 100, uh?
100 for what? For this?
- No, sir.
No? Okay.
2,000.
2,000? Ah, okay.
Yeah, 2,000. I don't think so.
I don't want it at all.
I don't want it. It's okay.
Discount less price, okay, I give you discount.
No, I don't want it.
It's not about the discount. I just don't want it.
You try. No plastic, sir.
Yeah, okay.
Last price, how much?
Zero, because I don't want it.
Okay.
No, thank you, bro. No, thank you.
Big discount.
Okay 300.
300? You went from 2,000 to 300.
You went from 2,000 to 300.
Okay, big discount.
Look I...
- Big discount.
I don't wear jewelry at all.
Look, there are many people around you can sell to.
Okay, thanks, bro.
What, 200?
You went from 2,000 to 200?
200, uh?
Okay.
Okay, 200.
Can you put it on me, please?
I will wear.
Oh, it goes like this?
- It's nice.
Okay, then you tie it.
Okay, it is nice.
Okay, I don't really wear
jewelry, but I'll buy just to help you out.
Sir, necklace.
What's that? Necklace? No, no, it's okay.
You did well to sell me this because I don't wear jewelry.
There's 200.
- Thank you.
Okay, nice one, bro. Nice one.
Okay, that's cool.
Got a 90% discount.
Not really a 90% discount because it's
not worth 2,000 in the first place, you know?
Guys.
You're always trying to get things for a lower price.
Guys, I don't want it.
I don't want this at all.
I'm just gonna give it to somebody else.
I just bought it to help the guy out.
He pays pennies for it.
He doesn't sell it without a profit, etc, etc.
If you're smart, you know that,
but there's plenty of stupid people,
plenty of stupid people in the comments that will say,
that I just ripped that guy off.
And he only sold it for
that price because he was desperate.
Oh, the poor man, etc, etc. Shut up. Shut up!
Guys, I'm gonna go and check
out this Hinagdanan cave, right here.
This place, apparently closes at 4 o'clock.
I think, actually there's a
ticket booth outside that I've missed.
Hi, I have to get a ticket somewhere or?
On the white ????
Okay, I've missed it.
- But we have to tell you,
it's full inside.
- It's full already?
You have to wait.
Ah, how will I have to wait?
- Maybe 10 to 20 minutes.
10 to 20 minutes? Ah, okay.
You can hi.
Okay, 10 to 20 minutes.
Okay guys, today's not very fun.
I'm gonna be honest. I'm not really enjoying today at all.
It's hot, it's humid, it's rainy.
This place is really busy. I have to wait.
That food park was boring, there was
nothing open and they were playing loud music.
Ah, man.
I've got one already. Look.
How much?
- Right here.
How much you think?
Same price, okay.
No, you got, no, no, no, no, no.
One is enough, one is enough. Okay.
200? No, it's okay.
I got one for 200 though. That's good that, he gave me one for...
He offered 200, he offered 200.
Hi, how are you bro? Hello. Nice to see you.
He offered me 200 pesos right off the bat.
That's good.
Ah, yeah, so, yeah, I'm
gonna, I'm gonna come back here tomorrow.
Tomorrow's Monday so it's
gonna be a lot quieter than it is today.
Guys. What's that?
Give me money, 200 pesos.
No, I've got one already,
man. You can't sell me another one.
Bro, like, I didn't even want this one.
I didn't even want this one, so.
Two.
- No, no, no, I'm not...
He's seen that I'm a fool who buys
these things so now he's trying to sell me one.
It's okay, no, no, it's okay, bro.
I'm gonna head off. I'm gonna head off out of here.
150.
- No, no, no, no.
150.
- Oh, I got ripped off.
Now he's offering it for 150.
Now I know I got ripped off for this one.
Oh, you're killing me. You're killing me.
You're killing me. No, no, I got one.
I got one. One is enough. One is enough.
Okay, thank you bro. Nice to see you.
Okay, I'm sad now. I know I got ripped off.
I didn't get the best price.
Sir...
What?
Mother pearl.
What's that? The pearl? How much is that?
No, inside. Here, mother pearl.
Oh, the pearl's inside?
Yeah, mini, mini, baby.
Oh, baby's I see it there.
- Mama, mama.
It's okay. I don't want it, man. It's okay. But thank you, thank you.
Oh, this one here.
Dude, there's many tourists there.
There's many, okay, it's enough, enough.
There's many tourists that you can speak to. I'm done.
Thank you, bro. Thank you.
Okay, well. This place looks like it's
gonna be a lot quieter than that cave.
Google Maps says it's here, but this is just houses.
Looking for the seashell museum.
Seashell.
Is it, oh, it's in here?
Oh, okay, thank you.
There's no sign, so
must be a small thing, guys.
Oh, here we go. This is it.
Only two cars here.
Good afternoon.
- This is seashell museum. Okay, 100 per adult. Okay.
Oh, you're closing today, Sunday at 4 pm?
Yeah. Okay, in half an hour.
Okay, I made it just on time.
Thank you.
Thank you. You can go inside.
- Okay.
Yeah, it is like two rooms here with hundreds
and hundreds, probably thousands of seashells.
Big ones, small ones, weird looking ones there.
Yeah.
Pretty cool.
I wonder if those are real, those big ones right there.
I think that's just decoration.
That's a real shell, sir, right there. Giant clam.
There's no way they're real. They're too big.
It is real.
- No way. You're joking me.
A giant, what was inside that?
It's fossilised giant clam. It's already fossilised.
Oh, it's fossilised, so that's from prehistoric times.
Yeah.
- But you can't get like this anymore?
But they're bigger, smaller
type of shells, just like that.
What is the biggest one you can get these days?
Actually this is the biggest one.
But even today you could find in the sea like that, no?
- No, no, no, no, no. It's already extinct, sir.
Yeah, but today, like in the
sea, like a live one, what is the biggest?
Just like this size.
- Oh, this one.
But they already cultured it, sir. They cultured it.
What does that mean, they cultured it?
Cultured, in a farm.
Ah, okay, so they actually like breed it,
but you call it culture for this type of thing.
Yes, sure.
Yeah, so what...
This is ????
Yeah, so what is living inside of it?
A huge mollusk.
- A mollusk? Ah, okay.
They're like snails, a
soft-blooded creature that lives inside the shell.
So it's like the sea version of a snail.
- Exactly.
Yeah, a mollusk.
- But it's so huge.
Because just imagine.
Yeah, and these give pearls or no?
Where...? What do pearls...
Pearls come from the....
They're capable of producing pearls, but yeah.
It's not all type of shells.
Ah, okay, so what are the common ones for pearls?
This one.
This one's here?
Oh, so this type of shell are the
ones where you would commonly get the pearls.
Ah, okay.
Is that also a mollusk? Is that also a mollusk?
- Yes, still mollusk.
Ah, okay, so they're all still mollusk.
We called it Pinctada maxima.
Like, that's why Philippine
is known as Pearl of the Orient,
because you can only find it here in the Philippines.
- Ah, okay.
Especially in Mindanao.
Ah, Mindanao, okay.
A famous shell, because you can
see this type of shell in 1,000 peso bill.
- Uh huh.
Oh, it's actually on the 1,000 peso.
I'm gonna check. I'm gonna check right now.
It's Pinctada maxima.
This is the one, right here.
So this is the 1,000 peso, and
this is what is on it, right there.
Oh, wow.
And it's most commonly in Mindanao?
- Yes.
Okay, cool.
Also here in Panglao, sir.
- In Panglao,
but unique to the Philippines islands?
- Yes.
Ah, okay, that's why they put it on the 1,000 peso bill. Ah it's cool.
Thank you.
So is this your museum? You're the owner?
No, no, no, I'm not the owner. I'm just a local tour guide here.
Ah, okay, okay. So there's...
We're both guide, local tour
guide, and we're working here for a long time.
Ah, okay. That's good.
- I worked here for almost 10 years.
10 years?
- Yes, and her is 18 years.
18 years in this museum?
Oh, okay.
And this is actually a private collection
of Mr. Quirino Hora, a Filipino shell collector.
So he collected the shells for 50 years.
Oh, is he still alive?
Yes, he is.
- He's still alive.
He's 83 years old.
Ah, okay, so since he was
33, he was starting collecting the...
Exactly.
He started collecting here?
Here in Panglao.
Ah, oh wow.
And he's built up a huge collection.
- Actually he started from his brother.
Yes, his brother and then by
that time, he's the one who collect a lot of shells.
So now, him and his family own this museum?
And the one who managed the museum is his eldest son.
His son? Ah, okay. Oh, wow.
I think, have you seen the Nautilus, the famous Nautilus?
No.
Nautilus shell or also known as the fastest swimming shell.
It's beautiful. Can touch or not?
- Yes, yes.
Can touch? Really? Oh, wow.
Just be careful.
Wow. It's so cool.
You're fortunate because we allow you to touch it.
Oh, but most people not allowed?
We don't allow it.
- Ah, okay. It's okay. I'm careful.
I never drop or break anything. Really, honest.
Yes, so the first submarine which is
known as Nautilus I is based from the shell.
Oh, it was the design?
The first submarine which is known
as Nautilus I was based from the shell.
Ah, okay.
So this is what it looks like and then if you
will cut it into half, this is the inside of the shell.
Yeah, okay. I'm not gonna pick that up. It looks delicate.
Yeah. It's chamber Nautilus.
It looks like a propeller for submarine.
- Yeah.
This is moving fast.
- Wow.
A living fossil that's found here in
the Philippines, especially here in Bohol.
This is a very common shell, sir.
And usually the meat is so good.
- Ah, okay.
Just to be able to catch the shell,
usually they put like a trap, a chicken meat.
Oh, like that. And they will try to go for it.
And then they will catch it.
- Yes.
Okay, like in a trap.
- Yeah.
Yeah.
But it's not very common that we eat this
shell here in our place. But there are
some fishermen that they said that
they found it and they tried to eat it.
They tried to eat, like what
is inside the shell? The mollusks?
Just the mollusks.
- They tried to eat that?
Yes.
- Like they grill it or something and just eat it?
I don't know how did they did it.
What's the form of cooking.
- Yeah.
I don't know.
Ah, okay. Yeah.
This is one of the smallest shell in the Philippines.
This one here? Oh, I can barely see it.
- And that costs 1,000 US dollar.
1,000 dollars? Wow!
- Yes, sir.
How did they even find it?
It's so, it's like a tiny little speck.
Yeah. It is attached on a bigger size of a shell.
Oh, like that.
- That's how we found it.
Ah, wow.
So some of the local fishermen actually found it.
So these are all the smallest ones?
One of the smallest. 6.1 millimeter from
Balicasag Island, which is still part of Panglao.
Wow.
- A very rare shell.
These are all small ones.
- Yeah.
And then this pearl is from this type of a shell.
Ah, these are the pearls here.
- Yeah, a real pearl.
South Sea. We called it South Sea Pearls.
Yes.
So how do they get them out of this?
This one actually is still undeveloped.
It's still undeveloped.
- Ah, right.
So it will stay like that.
It can't develop more after it's like this?
- Yeah.
Yes, exactly.
So if it's a fully grown pearl, this is what it looks like.
Ah, okay.
And some foreign ones as well.
- Yes.
Um, he has friends from other
countries like they give it to him.
Yeah.
- And he give also some shells.
Oh, they exchange. They exchange.
Ah, that's cool.
- So I think these are rare shell.
These are rare shells. Rare shells.
Yeah.
- These are rare shells.
Yeah.
This is from a Gulf of Guinea
from Caribbean Sea, from Caribbean Sea.
Wow.
So cool.
And these are all man-made.
Oh, this is just like decorations.
Fiberglass.
- Fiberglass? Ah, okay.
Oh, this is a big version of the nautilus there.
- Yes, exactly.
Oh, that would be a good decoration to have in your home.
Yeah.
That's cool.
And this one also is the rare shell.
Oh, but this is the real one?
- Yes, this is the real one.
Oh, wow.
This type of shell is known as trumpet of the sea.
Trumpet of the sea? Wow
- Yes.
So this is Charonia tritonis, but this
is endangered,
You're not allowed to buy or take out shells.
Ah, but he must have taken it before,
those laws.
- Yes, yes, yes, yes.
Yes, yes, yes, before it
becomes endangered, we have this ready.
Ah, okay. So he's allowed to keep it?
Yeah.
And then we have here also the
soft coral sea sponge, Venus flower basket.
So it glows in the dark when it's alive.
Really? Ah, wow.
- Yes, this is bioluminescence.
So it gives light under the sea.
- Ah, okay.
This is the type of thing when people
dive, do night dives, they will see this and it'll be amazing.
And you know, sir, some of the Japanese,
they have some beliefs also that this is a good
gift for a newly couple.
Because for them it symbolises fidelity.
Yeah, I see it looks like something, right?
It looks like something.
- I know what you're thinking.
It looks like something.
- Yes.
This is a sand dollar. Sand dollar...
Sand dollar, like the money?
- Yes.
I think they call it sand dollar because
the money in US has this, like a flower in it.
Ah, okay.
Or also known as sea biscuits.
- Very flat. Yes, sea biscuits.
Yes, sea biscuits.
And then we also have here a shell named
after the owner of this museum, because he discovered the shell.
He discovered it, so it was named after him?
Yes, Bursa Quirihorai.
And this is Primovula horai.
So his real name is Quirino Hora.
So it's a combination of his name.
Quirino Hora, yes.
And then the rest, he named it after
Bohol, since you can only find it here in Bohol.
Aliria Boholensis, Kornus Boholensis, and Tutufa Boholica.
And we have here the venomous shells.
Venomous?
- Yes, sir.
Yeah. You can't, if you touch them or?
Actually, once you sting inside the
shell, you'll be paralysed or worse, you'll be dead.
For any of these?
All types of cone shapes, small or big.
- Wow.
So if you see any of these when
you're swimming around, don't touch them.
That's why when you do diving or
snorkeling, don't touch anything.
What, just random things, yeah.
Because we have this attitude.
Wow.
So they're all the kind of same shape, like a cone.
The insides, sir. For example, like this one.
But now they're safe, right?
- Of course.
Okay, okay. I'm just making sure.
What is it, the mollusks that's inside that is?
It's like a sting, like a bee.
Oh, it actually has a stinger.
Stinger, yeah.
So once you sting inside the shell.
But you know, sir, here in
University of Utah, they're Filipino scientists.
They're studying the toxin of this
shell can cure to the people who have an epilepsy.
Oh, like that?
Yes, an epilepsy or?
So they're extracting something from the venom.
Or a painkiller.
I don't know how they do this.
Yeah, they must do something.
- A painkiller.
Ah, like that.
So they're studying it?
- Yes.
Ah, okay.
And this is sea cord, a sea urchin.
Sea urchin, wow.
Yeah, but actually there are several types of sea urchin.
Yeah.
So once you sting inside the shell,
you'll be paralysed or worse, you'll be dead.
Wow.
This is the most expensive one?
The middle one.
- The middle one?
Yeah, the middle.
- How much does it cost?
This is 150,000 pesos.
- 150,000 pesos?
Oh, and it was found in 1879?
Actually sir, the year is when
they identified the name of the shell.
Ah, okay, but this shell isn't that old.
- Yes.
But it's so rare, right?
That's why it's so expensive.
You can only find it in 250 metres.
Oh yeah.
From tangle net.
- From tangle net.
So, for 25 years of finding or for
looking, they found it in Mindanao, in Davao.
After looking for 25 years. They found one. Only one?
Two.
- They found two.
Ah, okay, so.
We're lucky to have one.
- You have one.
You have one of the two that are known about.
The one which is already sold.
It's already sold.
What do you mean it's already sold?
Someone bought it.
- This?
The other one.
- Oh, the other one.
Ah, okay, so that's why it's worth 150,000.
They bought it for 150,000?
We bought that one from the
local fishermen for 100,000 pesos.
100,000 pesos.
But the Japanese shell collector is a friend of our boss.
Bought ???? from us for about 80,000 pesos.
Ah, right, okay.
Careful.
Oh yeah, you have to pay for it if you break it. Yeah.
Not joking.
You really have to pay for it.
We still have a lot of rare shells.
Yeah.
- These are rare shells.
We call it kawori shells.
Kawori shells.
- Wow.
And they come out the sea this shiny
or you have polished them?
No, it's natural, sir.
- It's natural? Oh wow.
Yeah, that's natural.
This is Cypriot Valiokudon,
Valencha Valencha, Oranshum, or Golden Kawori.
Wow.
And we have this also, this is the
famous, the most famous poisonous shell of all.
This one.
- And again a cone shape.
Venomous.
Cone shape, yes.
Conus gloria maris, or glory of the sea,
and the first specimen was found here in Bohol.
Ah, okay.
But these are all venomous, all the cone shaped ones.
Yes, more venomous.
All these are venomous.
Even here.
- Oh, wow.
Wow.
This is the most venomous one.
- So that's it.
An important thing I learned today is
if I see anything cone shaped, I'm not touching
Yeah exactly.
- I am not gonna touch it.
Actually, when you found some, maybe we
can find some cone shaped shell in a shoreline.
Yeah?
- Those are empty shells or
some of the hermit crab lives on it.
Yeah
- So it's safe.
But, if I'm diving and I see something cone shaped, do not touch?
- Don't touch.
Okay, but on the beach it's gonna be fine?
Yes.
This is the most venomous of all.
This one.
It has times two venom compared to snake.
Conus geographus.
And is there anti-venom? Like... no?
- No, not anti-venom.
So if you're...
Just wait.
Yeah, that's it, you just have to wait
and see if you're gonna die or not.
Wow.
Yes.
And the natural colours of the shell.
They're all natural?
Oh, wow.
Beautiful.
Yeah.
Very nice.
Yes, scallops are coloured pectin.
They adapt from the environment and from
the food that they eat and from sunlight as well.
That's why it has different colours.
Hey, this is by the way the source of
the most expensive pearl in the Philippines.
Oh, so they're found inside this.
It's called what?
Melo, melo, melo shell.
Melo, melo?
- Yeah.
Wow.
Melo three.
Melo, melo, melo.
That's the same thing.
Oh, wow.
The pearl must be huge, right?
Or we call it binga.
Binga.
This is a very common shell
here in Bohol, but the pearl is so rare.
What size is the pearl? Like this size?
The standard size only.
It's like...
- Really? Ah.
It depends like 10 millimetre, 11 millimetre.
Ah, I just thought because this
is big, the pearl would also be big.
I can show it to you.
- Ah, okay.
Here, the other side.
Ah, like this?
Ah, okay, yeah, it's a standard pearl size, okay.
This is 13.5.
This is 13 millimetre.
Okay, and those are the ones from that?
Yes, from this shell.
And how much do they cost for one, if you're were gonna buy them?
It depends, sir.
Yes, it depends.
But they are the most expensive?
Here in our...
For sale.
Oh, this is all your for sale things?
Ah, okay.
It depends sir, 15 to 20,000 pesos.
Oh, wow. For one?
For a pair.
Oh, for a pair. Ah because they'll use them for earrings?
Yes, for a pair of earrings and...
- Yeah.
But if it's real gold, then it's more
expensive because the settings of our jewelries, it's
only stainless steel and it's...
Ah, okay, but they will take
them away and get a jeweler to...
Yes, yes, exactly.
That's what some of
our... the local people who usually buy it.
Ah, right. I see.
And then, as you can see,
it has a lot of fish bites as well.
You see that?
Ah, right.
- The dent.
Okay, so they're not 100% perfect.
- Yes.
They have flaws because...
That's what makes this pearl unique.
Okay, yeah.
- Yeah.
And differentiates it from something
that's fake and made in a factory like that.
Yes, exactly.
- Okay.
That's really cool.
- Yes.
Well thank you so much for giving me the tour.
It was really nice of you. Yeah.
So if anybody wants to come here,
you can easily find this if you type in Nova Shell...
- Museum.
Yeah, Nova Shell Museum on
Google Maps, you'll find it easily enough.
Thank you, so much.
- Thank you.
What is your name?
My name is Kim.
Kim.
Thank you so much.
Thank you.
- Thank you, bye. Okay.
That's good guys, that's good.
I would definitely recommend
coming here and checking this place out.
Thank you, so much.
So I'm the last one?
Oh, no, you've got two more.
They've come just before you close.
- Yes.
Okay, thank you so much.
Thank you.
Bye.
- Bye-bye.
Okay.
Well guys, it is now about 4pm
and I'm gonna head back to my hotel.
The weather is a lot cooler,
fresher, drier than it was earlier on.
It's actually nice now.
The weather conditions are actually nice
but, yeah, it's gonna be dark in a couple of hours,
so I can't really be on like big adventures or whatever.
A lot of places closing as well, around this time.
So, yeah, I'm gonna head back to my hotel,
call it a day and start a new adventure tomorrow,
going to the Chocolate Hills.
And it's a new day guys, and on
this new day, it has started raining.
It has just started raining.
Just as I was about to restart my vlog
and go drive to the Chocolate Hills, about an
hour and a half's drive away, it has started raining guys.
Unbelievable.
So today is supposed to be a dry day.
In fact, it's supposed to be the only dry day of this week.
I just checked the 7 day weather
forecast and it's raining thunderstorms every hour
of every day, but today is supposed to be
mostly dry and yeah, I was about to head out.
The sky looked blue and everything
but it's just started pouring down guys.
That is unfortunate.
The sky does look blue though so I'm
assuming when this shower is over,
it's probably gonna be dry and I am still hopeful that I
can get on the bike and take that long road trip
to the Chocolate Hills.
Like I said, it's gonna be my only
chance today, because tomorrow, the next day, if you
look at the forecast, the hourly
forecast, it's like 80%, 85% chance of rain every hour.
Today, this hour, right now, they
said there was a 30% chance of rain.
Next hour like 20%, then 15%, then 10%.
So today is supposed to be dry.
The rest of the days it's like, forget about it.
It's gonna be like this or worse,
probably much worse all day, every day so...
Yeah, I'm just gonna hang around just now.
It's 12.30 in the afternoon. Still got plenty of time.
Gets dark like 6pm. About an
hour and a half there, hour and a half back.
There are some places I want to stop at
on the way though, so I was thinking like now
would be the perfect time to go, but
yeah, I don't really fancy driving in the rain, so
I'm just gonna hang around and wait a bit.
Hello, good afternoon.
Hello.
Okay, so in the meantime, while this
storm goes on, I'm just gonna go to that executive
lounge and get some free drinks and
snacks. I've been going there a lot. It's nice.
They've always got good stuff. Get a fresh
orange juice and some savoury snacks. It's good.
Still people swimming though, despite the rain.
Hey, I guess you're getting wet
anyway, and the rain isn't cold or anything so...
I guess that's cool. Okay.
Okay. I won't get your place
wet. I'm just gonna go to the lounge.
5040.
Hello, room 5040.
Yes, sir.
- Okay.
Let's see what snacks they have today.
I asked for refill.
More are coming? Oh, you asked for refill. Ah, okay.
Yeah, beef tacos. Okay, I want some
of that. They must be popular already.
How about a drink sir?
Can I get a pineapple juice, please? Thank you.
- Okay, sir.
Some beef and papaya toast thing there.
Crab and tomato salsa on cucumber slice.
I like this. These little bite-sized pieces.
Beef tacos have arrived. I seen
three of them. I think I'm gonna take all three. Hi.
Hello.
Can I take all of them? Is that okay?
- Yes.
Can I just take the tray? Is that okay? Thank you.
I'll just give them like...
Okay, yeah. I'll put them on my table. Okay.
Thank you, so much. Cheers. Okay, these look nice.
Little beef tacos.
Mr Dale, your pineapple juice.
- Okay great, thank you.
Okay, so I'm just gonna chill here and munch this.
I'm gonna keep munching till the rain
stops and then we'll go on our little road trip.
Ah, thank you very much.
- I'll just get this, one second.
Okay, thank you.
- Thank you. Have a nice day.
Okay guys, the weather is dry again. Just like that.
And, oh, I dunno, see, there's a big black cloud there.
And everywhere. Okay, it's all a big black cloud,
but I don't have any choice. I think it's either
today or never if I'm gonna go to these chocolate hills.
So, if I get absolutely drenched on the
way there... I have got a raincoat that I hired.
But it's still not nice to have to
drive in the rain. You know, it's dangerous.
It's not fun. And it's a long, long journey.
But, gotta go for it. Don't have much other choice, do I?
Came all this way here. I have to
see the chocolate hills before I leave Bohol.
And there's also somewhere else I want to
stop off at on the way there or on the way back.
I haven't decided yet, but there's kinda like
a zoo or a conservation centre for these Tarsiers.
These tiny little monkeys. They're
about the size of the palm of your hand.
They're famous in this part of
the world. They're like an endangered
species, where there's only like, I
don't know, like 5,000 left in the wild.
And, yeah, they're endemic to this island,
so I should check them out while I'm here as well.
Okay, I've set my Google
Maps up for the conservation centre,
rather than the chocolate hills,
because it's on the same road anyway.
So this is gonna be 52 kilometres, an hour and 10 minutes.
And then if I want to skip this and go straight to
the chocolate hills, another 20 minutes up the same road.
But I'll decide whether I want to go
there on the way there, or on the way back.
Good afternoon, po. How are you? Good.
- Hey. Blogger!
So this is the main Bohol island ahead of us.
There should be a bridge around about here we can
cross and make our way onto the main big, big Bohol island.
This island that I'm staying
on right here is called Panglao.
It's much smaller but it is
still part of the Bohol province.
Here is the bridge here.
We're now entering Bohol island, guys.
This is the first Jeepney I've seen.
I haven't seen any Jeepneys back in Panglao.
So this is Tagbilaran. It's the main
city, the capital city I believe, of Bohol.
So they actually have Jeepneys here
and he's just parking right in front of me.
So the route I'm taking takes me
all along the coast. It's fairly scenic.
So we've left the road that takes us along the coast,
and we're now heading into the centre of the island.
Lots more trees around. Beautiful.
This is nice guys, this is nice.
This is beautiful. Check this out. Check out the scenery.
Right here. Fantastic. And no traffic ahead of me.
I'm enjoying this.
Actually, I've been travelling for almost an hour
and I haven't had a single
traffic light, so I haven't had to stop.
It's really been an enjoyable ride so far.
Now we're onto the mountain
road, guys. Just look at the Google Map.
It's all over the place. The squiggly lines.
We're going up, up, up, which I like.
It means the air's gonna be even fresher.
These windy bends. I feel like I'm Marc Márquez right now.
Some kind of adventure park there
where you can do zip lines and all that.
There's a zoo here.
There's a bunch of stuff up here.
I'm really only interested in seeing those little monkeys.
Okay, I believe this is it right here.
In fact, that is it, in there.
So, where does yer man park his bike?
Everybody seems to be parking their bikes right here.
Okay guys.
Remembered to take the key this time.
Okay, so it's 120 pesos.
One?
- Yeah, one person.
So that is about $2 bucks.
I got my ticket here to see these little creatures.
That's what they look like.
Right here.
Oh, apparently they're on the 200 peso bill.
I very rarely get any 200 peso
bills, so I haven't noticed that but
I'll look out for that the next time I get a 200.
Hello, how are you?
Hello sir, just fine.
- That's my ticket.
Here.
- Okay, where do I go?
Right side, sir.
Right side? Okay.
They are saying, "Don't touch the tarsiers."
I think that's how you pronounce it.
They're saying no camera flash as well.
I think that's how you pronounce it.
I've never heard anybody else say that. I've only ever read it.
Tarsiers. Tarsier. Tarsiers.
I don't know.
Hopefully somebody who works
here, I can get them to say it, then I'll know
the correct way to pronounce it guys, but it's saying,
"You should stay silent."
And I guess they're living,
I guess they're living in here, in this caged area.
I don't see any.
Maybe it's because I'm too noisy.
I'm scaring them off.
Come and see, Tarsier. Tarsier.
I don't know. I'm trying to see it.
That's what I'm trying to do.
There's loads of closed off parts.
Guys.
Did you see any?
Yes.
Oh yes, this way.
- Right there.
Many or?
- Just one.
Just one? Okay, I will try to look. Thank you.
This is one here?
I think that's one, like right there.
It's like sleeping like a bat.
That is Mario, five years old.
Mario? After Super Mario?
Where is Luigi?
Only Mario.
No, you need Luigi as well. You need brother.
No, only Mario?
- Mario, only.
Ah, okay, so he's five years old?
Yes.
But, these animals, they sleep in the daytime?
Okay, so all of them will be sleeping?
Ah, okay.
When to see them moving around? Have to come at night?
At night.
But you're closed at night?
- Yeah.
That's their time to hunt their food.
Ah, okay.
They hunt their food on their own.
Okay, so these are like wild,
but they're in this conservation area?
- Yeah.
Okay, so you make sure there's food for them?
What are they eating? Like insects?
- Worms.
Worms.
Okay, so there will be plenty.
Yes, that one, loud noise.
Yeah, crickets.
- Yes, that one.
Oh, they eat them?
So there are many? I can hear there are many.
- Yes.
Ah, okay.
I wonder how to pronounce the name for these animals.
Is it Tarsier or Tarsier?
Tarsier.
- Tarsier?
Ah, I never got it right. I
tried like three or four variations.
Tarsier.
- Yeah.
Okay, Tarsier.
These snacks for the Tarsier?
You're giving them to the Tarsier?
How are you?
Can I take a picture?
Okay, sure. Where are you from?
Philippines, Davao.
- Philippines, ah.
Davao? Ah, okay, in Mindanao, right?
- Yeah, yeah.
That's the big island that's south from here.
Thank you, sir.
Okay, no problem. Nice to see you.
- Have a nice day.
Okay, cool.
Yeah.
So that happens a lot, guys. They just want to the photo.
They don't care about like
speaking to me or anything like that.
They just want the hype from having the photo.
Oh, it's closed.
Many things are closed, right?
Yes.
Can?
There.
That one.
- There's one?
Oh, I see right here.
Oh, I can see his wee face.
Yeah, he's just lying there, hugging the tree like a koala.
I'd love to see them running around.
It's a shame that they're all gonna be sleeping.
We're not gonna see any moving around at all.
We're not gonna see any moving, right?
They're all gonna be sleeping.
Yeah, they're nocturnal so they're sleeping in day time.
This one.
This one's awake.
This one is awake, but he's just chilling, right?
Ah, he's awake, but he's just chilling there.
He's just moving like that.
Yeah, just very, very slowly sometimes just moving.
And something's winking as well.
Sometimes the left eye is like winking.
Yeah.
We do have that one, but we didn't take it today.
What, the GoPro?
Yeah, so that's why.
Actually, you get better footage
for zooming with your phone than the GoPro.
Okay, wow, now it's busy.
It's busy now.
I think people have
found one on this side and one there, so
it's like a huge traffic area now.
Hi, girls.

- Oh, this is day three.
Day three.
Yesterday rained too much, so I didn't come here.
I'm staying in Pangalao.
Pangalao.
We're from Dauis, the town next to Pangalao.
Oh really?
- Yeah.
Okay, yeah, it was a long journey here.
Yeah.
But I was just waited for the
rain to stop and then I started driving.
Ah you just rent a motorbike?
Yeah, I rented a motorbike yesterday.
Nice.
So you're all by yourself?
Yeah, by myself.
Yeah, so I can go wherever I want, whenever I want.
That's nice.
- It's good, yeah.
Yeah, you're not gonna get good signal here for sure.
Yeah, that's me. You can click follow.
Okay, thank you.
Sure.
We got a new follower.
We got one new follower, and maybe
two more as well, if they follow guys. Good.
Hey, hi.
Okay, good, thank you.
Thank you.
- Thank you.
Okay, no problem.
I'm gonna keep wandering around here.
Yeah, I think these...
Hello, how are you?
Good?
Okay.
He's way more lively than the tarsier... tarsiers.
Yeah, I don't think I'm
gonna see any of them moving around.
Unfortunately, guys.
Hello, sir.
Hi, how are you?
There.
Another one just hugging the tree.
Oh, look. Small.
Maybe three years old.
That one is the oldest one, nine years old.
No way. He's tiny.
Female, right?
It's a male tarsier.
Oh, wow, male.
It's male and old but it's very small.
Yeah, very long tail, sir.
Yeah, I could hold that in my hand so easy.
Do you ever hold one?
No, sir, they bite.
- They bite?
If you tried to hold it, it would just bite you.
Yeah, they have a sharp teeth.
Ah, okay.
That's a shame. I'd like to pet it.
I'd like to be like, "Oh, you're so cute."
But it would bite my finger.
And how old do they live to?
They live 15 to 24 years.
Oh wow, and in conservation
they live longer than in the wild or?
No.
About the same?
No they are different, sir. Maybe they live 15 or 20 years.
In conservation?
Yeah, in conservation.
And in the wild?
- And in the wild,
up to 24 years.
Oh, they live longer in the wild?
Ah, okay.
You know what?
They put the nets here just to avoid the jump
out, because they can only jump between the forest.
Ah, oh, jump between the trees?
Between the trees.
Cannot jump outside.
Ah, so they're too small to be able to jump over this?
Yeah.
In total, my driver told it's around 5
to 8 in total and they sometimes will
jump from the tree and kill
themselves because they're not happy.
What? Really? They will do it like that?
It's really, it's really.
- Oh, wow.
Local people told to us.
It's a sad story.
Why'd you tell me that? Now I'm sad.
I was so happy.
You told me a sad story about them.
Forget it.
No, you told me already. I can't forget it.
Now it's in my memory.
You told me already.
The reason is because this one
keeps the monkeys natural, not in the park.
Yeah, but there's only like 5,000 left in the natural.
So maybe they will go extinct.
They need to keep some for in case it goes extinct.
No, he said no.
They're not gonna go extinct?
- Just to make money.
Oh, just to make money? Ah, okay.
Well, you're supporting them, by giving them your 120 pesos.
You gave them your $2. Oh, this guy wants past, sorry.
Oh, I'm sorry, sir.
Yeah.
Because I didn't aware of it
until I took the car and the driver told us.
Oh, the driver's telling you that, the tour guide.
The tour guide is local guy.
Ah, so he knows.
He knows everything.
He said it's not good thing, but they must do it.
But he still took you here.
Yep.
- He still brought you here.
So it's conflict.
Yeah, okay.
Now I'm going to the Chocolate Hills.
Have you been already?
Yeah, we're going to Chocolate.
Oh, you're going now?
Yeah, I'm going as well.
I'm driving motorbike.
So maybe I will see you there.
Of course. Where you come from?
- Yeah, there's 2 viewpoints I seen on Google Maps.
One is a free one and one is
the one everybody goes to.
Take ATV?
- So I'm going to try and go to the free one first.
Well, somebody just marked it on Google Maps.
It has like one review, but it
says Chocolate Hills free viewpoint.
It's on the same.
Yeah, it's on the same road.
I'll check that out because
nobody will be there, so it will be cool.
And then I'll go to the one that's the
major one, which is just like, you know, like 300
more metres up the road.
Where you come from?
I'm from Scotland.
Scotland?
- Yes.
We are Chinese.
Yeah, Chinese.
Yeah, and now Chinese people are
finally, they let you out of your country finally.
Now you can travel.
After like 4 years.
You can finally travel.
Hi again, how are you?
- Do you mind if we take a picture?
Yeah, sure.
Oh, you bumped your head.
I got it on video as well.
- That's fine.
Everyone's going to laugh at you.
They're gonna be like 'that silly girl'.
That's fine, at least had a screen time.
- Okay.
Good point.
Take a picture.
Okay.
Selfie?
Good?
- Thank you so much.
Okay, no problem.
Have a nice time.
I'm going to Chocolate Hills now.
Yeah, we're heading there too.
Oh, I'll probably see you.
- Yeah.
I'm driving my bike there, so I will see you there.
All right, see ya.
Oh, see you.
Okay, so there's some souvenirs here guys.
You can get yourself a little Bohol Tarsier,
cuddly thing.
That's cute, isn't it? Look at the long arms.
That is very cute.
And tons of tat.
Tons of tat in here guys.
You can even get the wee
Tarsier t-shirts for your kids and such like.
Not too expensive for a gift shop. 200.
It's like, $3.50 or so.
Yeah, not too bad.
This the exit here.
Thank you. Thank you.
Okay, so I'm gonna go to the Chocolate Hills viewing deck.
But before that, there's a Chocolate Hills
free viewpoint that somebody's put on Google Maps.
It looks like it's somewhere, you can see
the hills, but you're not gonna have to pay anything.
So I'm gonna check that out first just to see what that
is, but I'm definitely going to the main viewing deck after.
Okay, let's do it.
24 minutes driving.
And the roads here in Bohol are awesome, guys.
I've not seen one single pothole,
this whole drive here, not one single pothole.
It's incredible.
Look how flat it is.
There are so many sections
that look like they've been re-tarmacked
recently, so it must be like,
if anything goes wrong with the roads,
like if they get broken up
like this, they just come and they
just re-tarmac that
section and they just keep on top of it.
So the whole road is perfect guys.
It's really a pleasure to drive on.
Welcome to Chocolate Hills.
And I see a few of them.
I see a few of them right here guys.
So there's apparently like 1,500 of these hills.
And they don't look very chocolatey. They look green.
But that's probably because all the rain we've been having.
Okay, so this one here, with no sign,
this is the one that on Google Maps is the unofficial
free observation point for the Chocolate Hills.
I think that's the main observation
point right there where everybody goes to.
Let's see where Google Maps takes us.
So this is where Google Maps has taken me to.
Right here. There's nothing here.
Unless I have to get off and walk.
Yeah, the actual free point is like
you're gonna have to hike for it or something.
Ah, I think this is a fail.
Let me see.
But I'm at the place on the road and then it's like a...
Well, it's to the right, isn't it?
So it would be up there.
You'd actually have to walk up to the top of that hill.
And that does look chocolatey, doesn't it? That is brown.
Okay.
The problem is I don't see any way there.
Oh yeah, there is a trail here.
It's not a very beaten path, but maybe there is a way.
Right, hopefully my motorbike is
gonna be safe if I just leave it here.
Nothing ventured, nothing gained, guys.
Is there? I've left the bike off the road a wee bit and
I'm gonna try this trail.
Yes, somebody has built a bridge
over this little stream here.
I guess this is a...
OH F***!
F***!
OH! Oh my god!
F***ing hell!
Jesus!
God darn!
What's this?
Oh, it's a flipping closed gate with a padlock.
The padlock's not even working but
I don't think this is a place that I can go.
I don't know if maybe that's the trail, but guys, oh!
Look at the state of me.
God darn!
Okay, my legs are already
dirty. Let's get them scratched up
by these nettles and stuff.
God, oh and it's all soggy.
Doesn't matter if it's soggy.
I'm already
soaked.
Oh, what a terrible idea.
And this isn't even a trail, guys.
Oh, my word.
This isn't even a trail. It's like a swamp.
There's nowhere I can walk.
Ah, man.
I don't even know if there's a way up there, guys.
It doesn't even look like there's any kind of footpath.
You can't even see like a trail going up the...
Up the hill. There's some wild animal there.
What are you?
It's a deer.
Looks like a deer over there, just staring at me.
Like a deer with its...
It's been caught in the headlights.
Look at the state of that.
Look at it.
I'm gonna have to
spend at least another
few hours
with soggy feet.
Guys, I can't even remember how I got through.
All this, but
yeah, I dunno. Is there a way? Is there a way that I can...
Oh no, it's all swamp.
This is all swamp, guys.
I'm thinking about it. I'm thinking about it.
Nah.
There's no actual path.
Screw it. I'm going to the main.
The real observatory with the real tourists
that
didn't have like a massive fail.
I'm getting scratched up.
- Nettles. It's all nettles and stuff, guys.
Look at this.
God darn it.
Get off the beaten path, they said.
Get off the beaten path. Well I got on this.
I'm not gonna make the same mistake twice.
There is still... Whoa!
I did nearly make the same
mistake twice. I'm gonna have to...
See, if somebody hadn't built that bridge,
I would have just jumped over it like that easily.
And not had that fail.
But they made a bridge
that's like a booby trap. It's like a...
It's like an old booby trap.
Hope you're proud of yourself, whoever...
Whoever put that there.
Hi, how are you?
I try to go up. Cannot?
Can go up?
Can go up?
Yes? Where? Go?
Here? Here?
Here?
Up here?
No.
Here and right.
There's a path.
Really? And can go up here?
Okay, I will go. Thank you. Thank you.
Okay.
So she must live around here.
Ah.
Yeah, I wish I had met her,
like 5 minutes ago.
I've sprained my ankle just
a wee bit, guys. Just a wee bit.
Nowhere near as bad as I've
sprained it in the past. I can actually...
I can actually walk on it.
But,
she says I can go up. I think
it was pretty clear what I was asking.
And she says yes.
Nodding her head.
Who knows? She might be a prankster.
Maybe it was her that laid the booby trap.
And maybe up here and to the right doesn't mean just here.
Maybe it means I have to take my motorbike and go up.
I dunno.
I do not know.
There's this guy here.
Looks like the farmer. He's taking the buffalo for a walk.
Hello. Can I go up?
Yeah.
This way.
This way. Walking or... I take my motorbike.
Straight.
Straight?
There's a path?
Okay, I will take my motorbike and go.
You can just..
I can walk?
How many metres?
10 metres, sir.
Only 10 metres? Okay, thank you.
Okay, he says it's only 10 metres.
There's a path,
somewhere. I don't see any path though.
I dunno what 10 metres means in the
Philippines, but it's not what 10 metres means to me.
It's been about 50 metres and I don't see a path.
Hey, guys.
Yeah, it's just a farm.
So he's saying I can get up.
I'm going way past the hill. That's the thing.
So there's this, with the goats.
Am I gonna get attacked by a goat?
I can just imagine.
Like I'm gonna get attacked by a goat or
something like, that but that is an actual path guys.
So that's where I'm going.
These are on a leash, so I just need to get far
enough away from it on this side that it can't come at me.
Surely they're...
Oh yeah, they heard me speak and they kinda moved away.
Look at the size of the nuts on that one, the sack.
There.
Yeah.
Good.
I like those goats.
They're not like those wild oryx in the desert of Ras
Al-Khaima with the big horns that just charge at you.
Aye, still got that memory in my mind.
That's why if you think, "Oh, you're such a
scaredy cat, Dale. Why are you scared of a wee goat?"
Well, I've had experience
getting attacked by animals such as that.
Horny animals.
Okay.
So, I'm gonna guess this is the first
vlog anybody's done on this viewpoint guys.
It's not sign posted.
Somebody's put it on Google Maps. There's one review of it.
So, yeah, if there is an actual
viewpoint here, yer man will be number one.
Which is quite an accomplishment for a place
like Bohol, where it's definitely on a tourist map.
Hi, guys. How are you?
- Hi.
Oh, where did that come from?
- Hi.
Oh, I see, he's up the tree.
Hello. Oh, there's two of them. Like tarsiers.
This tarsier? Tarsier?
It's tarsier.
What are you eating?
Oh, this is like a water apple.
Yeah, I know this. I've tried this before.
Bro, I want to go up.
This way.
Which way?
This way.
There's a path, yeah?
Ah, okay, good.
Okay, I will go up.
How many minutes walking?
How many minutes? You don't know? You never go?
- Don't know.
Never go. Yes, yes.
You never go?
Yes.
Really? Ah, okay. But it's up
this way? Okay. Thank you, bro. See you.
Okay.
This way, yeah?
Yes, yes.
Okay. That doesn't look like a path to me.
Bro, that doesn't look like a path to me.
Or here? What is this?
It's like a little cave here.
Ah, that's a fire.
So they use that as like a
bonfire or something for cooking.
Oh yeah, this'll be the path. Okay.
Looks like they've been
doing something. The coconut's here.
There's a ton of coconut shells.
Yep, okay.
This is good. This feels like a proper adventure, you know?
After doing all that touristy stuff.
Going to places where there's tour buses.
There's groups of Chinese, Germans, English,
getting out of tour buses.
You never feel like you're having an
adventure when you go to those kind of places.
But when you're doing this, you
don't even know what you're gonna expect.
You don't even know if the information you've
been given from that one person on Google Maps was correct.
You don't know exactly what you're gonna see at the top.
Yeah, it's a bit of a thrill, guys.
So, you know, these are the travel moments I enjoy.
Not so much the soggy foot.
Don't particularly enjoy... Oh, yes. Oh, yes.
Look at it.
Look. We're getting the view, guys.
So some of them are green, some
of them are a bit darker, like chocolate.
And I can see maybe, well, at least a dozen,
at least a dozen of the chocolate hills,
right here already. I'm already getting a good view.
And I'm assuming it's gonna
be even better from the top of this.
This is actually a chocolate hill that I'm going up.
So I'm actually going up one of the chocolate hills.
I don't know if they each have names or what.
There's a ton of them. There's like, in fact,
trying to find specifically how many there were.
There's estimates from like,
at least 1,200 to maybe like 2,000.
So we'll say about 1,500. There's about 1,500 of them.
And, yeah, what makes it brown?
This looks like it's been burnt or something.
Or is that just the colour of that plant?
It has very dark roots.
And at the base of its kind of trunk there.
I don't know.
And it's kind of muddy soil as well.
But yeah, this is definitely taking us up.
Fantastic. Check it out.
Check it out guys.
The free unofficial viewpoint off the chocolate hills.
That's my bike down there.
That's the swamp where I fell.
That's the farm, with the buffaloes
and that. Yeah, it's just a couple of farms here.
Guess those kids are the sons of the farmers.
Just chilling out, hanging.
Well hanging out, hanging off the tree.
Like tarsiers. Like little palm-sized monkeys.
Very nice. Okay.
Ah yes, the breeze.
Oh, and there's the real viewpoint there.
That's the real viewpoint.
Well, I say real.
I guess this is the real
one, because it's not a tourist trap.
This is the real one.
This is really real.
Guys, check it out.
This is picturesque, isn't it?
Look at this.
These hill formations, that I
guess must be from volcanic activity.
Look, it's just this whole area.
And I've read it's a 50 kilometre radius
or a 50 kilometre, 50 square kilometre area
that contain these 1,500 chocolate hills.
It's a big, big area guys.
So we're just seeing, like I say, we're
just seeing maybe like a couple dozen of them.
So we're seeing maybe 2%, 2%
of the chocolate hills right here.
Even though it looks incredible, you know?
It goes all the way over there as well.
And on the other side. I wonder if we can get the 360.
That would be, that would make it worth the soggy foot,
the slightly sprained ankle.
Guys, that would make it worth it.
If you get the 360 from the very peak of here,
that would make it worth it.
Let's do it.
Let's do it.
Here we go, guys.
We can see the other side.
There's no hills on that side.
But look, we are at the peak.
There's a flat area right at the peak.
And check it out guys.
Check it out.
Chocolate hills,
I am up you.
I am right up you.
So get it right up you.
I'm right up you.
I'm right up you, the chocolate hills.
Look at this.
360 degrees.
Let's do the panoramic, guys.
Let's do the panoramic.
Check it out.
And that's the one you pay for, the viewpoint you pay for.
Which I don't even think I should bother going there now.
I was gonna go there after coming here.
What's the point?
I've got the best view.
There's no other tourists to annoy me.
I've got this all to myself.
All to yourself.
That's what you want.
That is the reward for the effort you put in,
for the risks you take,
for the injuries you get along the way, guys.
I'm talking like I'm
talking like I'm Edmund Hillary right now.
Who's just conquered Everest.
I've conquered one of the 1,500
chocolate hills, but it still feels good.
You know, I've been to all those tourist traps.
And this, feels awesome.
Look at this.
Wow, I wish I brought some food and
drink to just chill here for half an hour.
Wow.
Look, as far as you can see, just rolling hills.
I've never seen any kind of geological formation like that,
anywhere, in my travels.
Maybe the Teletubbie Hills in Sumatra,
were a bit like that, but there was
only like, I dunno, there wasn't 1,500 of them.
That's for sure.
Check it out, look.
Wow.
Deadly silent as well.
Incredible.
And it's good.
I can keep an eye on my bike from here, guys.
I can keep an eye on my bike.
Nobody's been anywhere near it, so I
don't feel in a rush to get back down there.
And just looking here at these plants,
they look like they have actually been burned.
Like this is, they've been set on fire right there.
This is all ash.
So I don't know if this is a common thing.
Like during the dry season maybe
they, you know, they just spark up and
go into flames or maybe somebody set
them on fire like the little kids down there.
Just set it on fire for a laugh, I dont know.
But that's why this one's more chocolaty than the rest.
I think I'm on the only actual chocolate hill right now guys.
The only one that actually looks chocolaty.
All the other ones look mostly green, right?
Yeah, some of them,
some of them look a bit chocolaty
but, yeah, this burnt one is the most,
the most chocolaty, guys.
Ah, you love it, don't you? You love it.
Feels good. I've almost forgotten about my little mishap.
That's how good it feels, guys.
I've almost forgotten about the mishap. Look at this.
Wow. Okay, yer man's gonna head back down now.
Oh, and not slip and not have any more mishaps.
You're feeling good now. You're feeling good, Dale.
Let's end the day on a high note.
Bye, guys. Thank you.
Thank you then.
You have channel in YouTube?
Yeah, I have channel on YouTube, Dale Philip.
Eh?
- Subscribe, subscribe.
Dale Philip, can I get a lad in a tree to subscribe to me?
I wonder, ah look, these can just be picked and eaten.
- What's your channel?
Dale Philip.
Yeah, Dale.
Dale Philip?
- Yeah, Dale Philip.
Thank you.
- Yeah, this your farm?
Yes. Okay, it's very nice. Beautiful.
Good. Remember to subscribe, okay?
Okay, I've got myself a free,
I think they're called water apples.
Shout out!
Shout out to who?
Shout out to the tarsiers.
Shout out to the tars..
Hey, monkey.
Who?
- Monkey.
What's your name?
Monkey.
Okay, his name is Monkey.
Okay, shout out. Oh, these are good.
It's like...
Salamat.
Thank you.
Thank you. How would I describe this?
It's like a cross between.
It's actually like rhubarb.
It's actually a bit like rhubarb, a bit more sour.
Oh, no, look what I have to get past.
These buffaloes. They're right on the path.
Like, his horns are literally right at the path.
I don't know how docile they are.
I don't know how they are with strangers.
How are you mate?
You're on a long leash as well.
I would have to, I guess if I go round that way,
I've probably have enough time, if he starts turning around,
I can run.
I don't know.
The last time I seen buffaloes,
oh it wasn't a nice sight.
It was in Torajaland.
Oh, here's his leash right there.
So this is the middle of it.
So, like, he's got a long leash.
He can, he's got a long radius.
So I'm doing it just slowly try to,
but he looks like he's at the end of the leash.
So if I get past him, I just have to run past him.
This is my thinking. I'm just thinking out loud,
guys. But I'm thinking I'm going nowhere near him.
Gave him a bit of water apple to eat.
It was nice.
Anyway, the last time I seen them was in Toraja
they were sacrificing them.
Wasn't a nice sight.
It's nice to see them all alive and happy.
Right guys, I'm not going to that official view point.
I've seen the chocolate hills
and I've seen it better than any of those tourists.
So I'm just going to start heading back now to
Panglao.
Aye.
Okay, I just had to drive a
bit to get the phone signal, right here.
I've got Edge 2G.
It's good enough.
If you don't download the offline maps,
you can't do directions when you're offline.
So I forgot about that. I should download the offline map.
But this is the way that I came.
I'm actually going to go a
different way back, just for variety.
It's more through the mountains and less down the coast.
So we'll just do that.
Take the alternative route back home.
It's 67 kilometres. 1.
1.5 hours.
There's only two hours of daylight left.
I guess I've got half an hour.
I could stop for half an hour for
something to eat if I find somewhere good.
Thank you. Come again.
No, thank you. Thank you for giving me the free viewpoint.
That was good.
Bro your kickstand's up.
Your kickstand is up.
Your kickstand is up. Kickstand.
The guy was driving with his kickstand up.
When he goes around this bend,
it's gonna hit the ground and he's gonna fall off his bike.
Okay, and this is where we go a different route from before.
The last time I came up that way.
So here is the alternative route home.
And it looks like a scenic one, guys, doesn't it?
Check it out.
Very nice.
We'll stop here for a wee drink.
Okay, let this car past first.
And rock up here.
Ah, looks like it's closed.
I see tons of these and they all look closed. Oh, hi!
Somebody is there.
I want a drink.
What kind?
You have Coca Cola Zero.
Oh, you like this?
Oh, you have cold ones? Ah, okay.
What is good?
You have Coca Cola, what else?
Fanta, no?
No.
No Fanta.
Orange?
Yeah.
Let's see.
- This one?
Yeah, okay, yeah, that's Fanta.
Yeah, this one. Okay.
Yeah, this small one.
How much is this one?
20.
- 20, okay.
Okay, 20 pesos.
Okay, thank you so much. Thank you.
Okay, thank you.
Okay, good.
Ah, it's not called Fanta here. It's called Royal.
There's tons of these.
Didn't have to do a U-turn. There's one there as well.
Just about every family, every house,
seems to have a wee shop in the front of it.
You see this a lot, right here.
The nets over the cliff there.
That's because this area is prone to landslides.
So that's helping stop whenever they
have like a big thunderstorm or something.
that's helping to stop the whole side of the cliff
falling to bits and ending up on the road.
Hi po. How are you?
You good? You good?
Why you riding a bike? You're little kids.
Your little kids, why are you riding a bike?
It's three of them.
Bye, bye, see you.
- Bye.
When I was their age I had a
pedal cycle and I was happy with that.
Maybe I can get some food here at Don Lechon.

What's wrong with Fanta?
The Royal.
Oh, one of his chickens are escaping.
Hey, chicken.
Chicken, come back.
Come back.
Okay, he knows what's in store for it.
It's gonna end up on the grill.
One of your chickens run away.

Okay, I'll eat the chicken.
Big old portion.
Chicken from here?

Yeah, it is.
It is a garden chicken.
How's the taste?
Yeah, good!

Meaty, meaty.
And you add flavour, right?
Yeah.
There's some kind of glaze.
Sweet, sweet.
Sweet?

What sauce you put?
Ah.
Sweet sauce.

Honey?
Oh, wow.
It's like honey glazed chicken.
Yeah, it's sweet.

Yeah, we have many chicken.
Oh, so many.
So many.
Hi, how are you?
Oh, the chickens are getting fed.
Are you a blogger?
- Yeah.
I'm feeding on the chicken,
and the chickens are feeding on this.
- What's your...
Dale Philip.
- Oh, yeah, yeah.
Yeah, you see me before?
Okay, good.
I watch your vids.
- Nice one, bro.
Welcome to Bohol.
- Are you Don?
Who's Don, Don Lechon?
Who's Don?
- Yeah.
- I'm Don!
- You're Don?
Ah, okay, where's Lechon?
Yeah.
Today, no Lechon, only chicken.
Lechon chicken.
Oh, Lechon chicken.
I thought Lechon was pig, no?
No, not pig.
No pig, no, only chicken?
Ah, okay.
Ah, right.
I watch your videos many times.
Ah, okay.
Good, thank you.
Okay, your chickens are very tasty.
They're very delicious chickens.
Thank you.
- But one ran away.
One ran away, it escaped.
Okay, so he says this is also Lechon, the chicken.
Maybe Lechon just means like rotisserie or something.
I've heard of Lechon, where they
rotisserie a pig, but I've never tried it before.
That's what I've been looking for, but
I've just never found one where they're actually,
you know, roasting the pig.
Can I take a photo with you?
- Oh, okay, sure.
Photo with Don Lechon.
These are your dogs or they just come from the street?
That's my dog.
That's your dogs? Okay!
I think the dogs want some of my chicken.
Good? Okay, good.
I think these dogs are after my dinner.
It's okay to give some to the dogs or?
Yeah it's okay.
- It's okay?
They're not gonna, the bone won't hurt them or anything?
No, no, no.
No, they can eat. Let's see.
They love generous people.
Oh, okay, let's see.
Let's see if we can give him this drumstick.
Do you want?
No, he doesn't want it.
I think he doesn't, he's running away, look.
But this one's coming for it.
You want? Oh, he just took it.
He just took it. This one was scared
and the other one was like, "Om!"
No waiting around.
- What's you,
Facebook?
- Yeah, Dale Philip.
Ah, Dale Philip.
- Yeah, Dale Philip, yeah.
He looks like he wants it, but then he's like nervous.
I guess I'll just throw a bit on the ground for him.
Maybe this bit here.
Yeah, this one?
I'll just put it here for him.
Yeah.
Yeah, that's me, yeah.
Oh, okay.
He's taken it.
Good, hopefully the bone won't hurt him.
Yeah.
I think they know how to chew meat off bones.
Dogs do.
Now they want more.
Oh, already? You eat already?
So fast.
- They're always hungry.
I'm gonna try this sauce here.
Oh, it's vinegar.
This is vinegar?
Yeah, vinegar and soy sauce.
Vinegar and soy sauce.
I already followed your page.
You already followed my page?
Okay, good. I didn't even have to ask him.
He is my brother.
Already? Ah okay!
- He is my brother.
You're Don and he is?
Dee.
- Dee?
Lindon, Lindee.
Lindon.
- Lindon?
Lindee.
Lindee?
Lindon, Lindee.
Hi, Lindee.
Good.
Lindee is my favourite
brother because he already subscribed.
What can you say to Lechon?
It's good!
- Yeah?
Yeah.
- Is it?
But I thought Lechon was only pig.
But Lechon can be...
This is Lechon when something is turning around?
Also chicken.
Ah, okay.
I need to find the pig one.
Yeah?
- Yeah, Lechon pig. I need to find.
Maybe when I go to Cebu.
Yeah.
- Yeah, Cebu is famous for it, right?
You want more, ah?
I'll give you the bony bits.
He can do all the chewing for me.
He can do all the chewing.
Oh, there you go. Now you take it.
Enjoy.
His name is Tiger.
His name is Tiger?
- Yeah.
Ah okay. But he's not brave like a tiger.
Oh, he's eating the bones.
Oh, he ate the bones.
It's okay for him or?
Yeah, it's okay.
It's okay, huh?
Because he's a strong tiger.
They're warrirors.
Okay.
Wow. I didn't expect that.
If you throw bones, then they will catch.
The dog will catch the...
Oh, if I drop any bits? Well, I drop food a lot.
I think these dogs know that I drop food a lot.
There's one under the table.
They will catch.
- Oh, it's him.
Running away, uh?
Running away, Tiger.
Okay.
Where's the other one.
I'll give it to your friend.
Where is he?
There, there, there.
I'll give it to your friend.
There you go.
See, you want it but you're scared.
There we go.
Oh, there you go, Tiger.
And this one is called?
Titan.
Titan. Oh, you give them strong names.
Strong name but small dog.
Yeah, but skinny dogs.
They need more chicken.
You need more chicken.
You need to get more fat.
Okay.
Some people throw hot water in the back.
That's why he gets...
Oh, he got that?
Yeah.
Wow. And then you found him?
No, no.
He come home and I found that.
So he's yours, he go out, come back?
He will go to the other house, around, roaming.
Ah, so somebody did that to him, like, deliberately?
Maybe.
Wow.
That's really sad.
Look at that.
That's so sad.
Maybe he went inside the kitchen with the other house.
He went inside the kitchen
when they're cooking or something
and they just throw water on him?
Ah, okay.
Wow, you guys are eating more than me.
They're eating more than me.
I gotta get some as well.
Yeah.
It's okay. My hotel has a lot of food.
Okay, I'll eat the skin.
The tastiest part.
And you can have all the meat.
Look at that. It's so big.
That's gonna...
That's gonna make you strong, tiger.
Tiger.
Gonna make you strong. He eats it so quick.
So quick.
He just wanna...
He must be so hungry.
Well, at least I'm not wasting bits.
Like, the bits that are around
the bone that I would otherwise be wasting.
They're always hungry when they...
Even they have their dinner, they're still hungry?
When I feed them.
Ah, wow.
Okay, good.
That's good. You don't have to throw anything away.
Food, like, they will always eat it.
Are you familiar with Seabourn? Cruise?
What is Seabourn?
Cruise line.
I don't know what it is.
Ah, you're not having a cruise.
What is it?
Ship.
Cruise ship.
Cruise ship?
- Yeah.
Oh no, I never do cruise ship.
No, yeah.
One day I will do.
Like a one week cruise or something, but...
I've never done.
He's a sea man.
Oh, he's a sea man?
Okay, so you work for the cruise liner?
Yeah.
- Ah, okay. Go where?
Around Asia?
Asia, Europe.
Ah, like that?
Antarctica.
Oh, wow.
So you work for like four months, six months?
Ah, just nine months.
Nine months? Ah, so you work nine
months and then rest three months, like that?
Off three months.
Ah, wow.
And now?
- Yeah.
Now you're resting or?
I am resting.
And you will go again to do nine months?
Maybe later.
Ah, oh, it's like a contract.
It's like contract, you do one nine-month contract.
And then you can choose if you want to do it again?
Yeah.
- Ah, okay. Yeah.
Which one?
- Now I'm just resting.
Resting.
Ah, now you're resting.
Ah, okay, you made the money.
In the nine months you make the
money and then you can rest for three months.
It's good.
Okay.
They're sharing it.
They definitely ate more than me.
But it's good.
Look at this.
I din't think, like, with all these
bones there would be such little left on the plate
at the end of the meal.
It's good.
Oh, you're fighting.
You already tried balut?
Balut? No, I didn't try it. I'm scared.
I know what it is but I'm scared. I don't want to try it.
You don't want to try the...
????
In the market there's also a...
In the market? Oh, in Tagbilaran?
Here.
- Oh, this market, they have, Balut?
I will try it.
Maybe I will try it when I go to Cebu.
Yeah.
Finished, guys. Finished.
Look, completely finished.
They're still looking at me for more.
Oh, I can wash my hands. Oh, good. Thank you.
Who takes the money. You the boss?
Oh, pay him? Ah, the chef.
It's Jerry.
Jerry? You're family or no?
My friend.
Friend. Ah, okay. But he's living here or?
No, he will come here to cook.
Ah, but this is your house?
Yeah, that's my house.
Ah, with you and your brother and?
And my father. And your father?
Okay, you all live together. Ah, okay.
And Jerry comes to do the cooking.
Wife of Jerry.
Ah wife of Jerry and son. Ah, okay.
Yeah, he fell off the hammock.
Yeah, when I was here.
- Ah, on the swing, right?
Yeah, he bumped his head.
But now he's happy again. He's watching his cartoons.
Yeah, it's good.
Thank you for eating here.
Oh no, thank you for the lovely chicken.
It was delicious. I wish I
ate more of it, but I felt guilty.
These guys are so skinny. I had to help them out.
I hope my viewers come and also when they go to chocolate hills,
they will stop here and eat the lechon.
Yeah, it's number one.
- Okay.
So I give the money to Jerry, right?
Yeah.
Jerry the chef.
Okay, thank you Jerry. You can keep the change, okay?
Thank you, Don.
- Thank you.
Thank you, Doggies. Thank you, guys. Thank you, baby.
Thank you.
See you bro.
- Have a safe trip.
Thank you very much. Thank you.
- Thank you, salamat.
Okay, that means, Salamat,
it means thank you in Filipino language.
I always thought Salamat was welcome because that's
Indonesian language like Selamat Detang.
But here Salamat means thank you.
So I learned another word in Filipino.
Bisaya.
- Bisaya?
Yeah, Bisaya language.
- Bisaya language?
What is Bisaya? This is the language for Bohol?
Yeah, Bisayan.
- Bisayan.
Bisayan dialect.
Ah, okay. So you have Tagalog and...
Bisayan.
- Bisayan.
And then you learn English third?
It's like Cebuano. Bisayan or Cebuano.
Ah, okay.
But this is the main one you speak?
Yeah, Bisaya. You speak with your brother like that?
Yeah. Ah, okay.
Yeah.
- Speak with me, Bisaya.
Ah, okay.
Wow, so yeah, difficult. You
have to learn three languages, right?
Tagalog, Bisayan and then English.
Yeah, English.
Three? Ah, okay.
How many languages you know?
Me, I know English and then
some Thai, a little bit of Indonesian. Yeah.
You travel, well
You have to learn many.
Yeah. Well, Indonesia it was
necessary to learn at least the numbers to
buy things and such like because
it's not like the Philippines.
They don't learn English much there.
You know? Even like university students, they don't speak...
Yeah, you can find university
students, a big group and not even one of them can
have a conversation in English.
Yeah, but Philippines,
any university student can speak
English in the Philippines, you know, like that.
So, yeah, some countries it's more
necessary to learn more of the language
when you visit, you know.
Yeah.
Okay guys, thank you, so much.
Thank you. What are you doing with this?
Bonfire?
We sell this.
- Ah, people come and they take for their fire in their home?
This one is 25 pesos.
Only 25 pesos, that's good.
Yeah, what is that? That's
like 40 cents or something like that.
Yeah, my dad would like that. He
has a fire for burning wood in his house.
My father, so he would like the 25 peso bundles.
That's good.
Okay, see you guys, see you. Thank you.
The vlog continues guys.
It's a couple of days since I've seen you
last and today is the day where I'm supposed to return
this motorbike right here.
I've been waiting for it to stop
raining. It's been torrential rain all day.
It kinda stopped about half an hour
ago. It's still just kinda like spitting.
Bu,t yeah, I'm gonna take this motorbike back to the shop
and I thought what I might do before I do
that is go to those Hinagdanan Caves or cave.
I think it might just be one big cave.
And check that out because, that's where I went,
that was one of the first places I went
when I got this motorbike, and it was too busy.
Like, bus loads of tourists.
Today is a
Wednesday. Today's Wednesday, not the weekend.
A little bit quieter here in Bohol.
Less tourists coming from Cebu and Mindanao and such like.
Yeah, maybe it's quieter and
maybe it'll stay dry while I ride there.
I really don't want it to ride
while it's pouring down with rain like it does.
It just pours down guys. It just pours down.
It just would not be safe to
ride this bike in those conditions.
Or fun.
But, yeah, hopefully it just
stays like this a little bit, spitting.
And I'll drive over to this Hinagdanan Cave.
And the reason I'm wearing this stupid bracelet is,
when I get there, I was just thinking, when I get there,
those guys are gonna be trying to
sell me bracelets and stuff like that again.
Those vendors, especially if there's less
tourists than before, they're gonna be even more pushy.
So I can wear this to say, I already
got one guys. One is enough. One is enough.
Okay, so 20 minutes drive away.
It's 2.30pm right now. The caves close at 4pm.
So plenty of time. And guys, I've watched some
of the footage back from the previous couple of days.
And I realised this phone
really gets in the way of the view.
There's not much I can do about it. The
GoPro is as high up on my chest as I can get it.
And I just kinda need this to navigate.
Even though the roads are fairly simple here,
I still kinda need it. So,
yeah, not much I can do about it, I'm afraid.
Just kinda, just
kinda look that way guys. Kinda look that way.
Okay, nearly there. And the
roads are certainly looking quiet.
I haven't seen any tour buses or
anything like that. So, yeah, it's looking good guys.
Hopefully this place is gonna be quiet when I get there.
Ah, here we go. Yes. The last
time there was like a big bus parked here.
There was tons of people waiting for tickets
there. There was a big queue to get into the actual cave.
Today just a few cars, a few minivans. Looking good.
How much for rent?
- How much for rent? 400 per day.
Ah, 12 hours?
- 24 hours.
Some are selling for 300, but this one is good.
New bike. Only 2,000 kilometres on the clock.
Ah.
- Yeah, so.
It's a little bit more expensive but
tyres are perfect. Everything is perfect, you know?
Yeah. I like it.
- The tyres are good.
Yeah, the tyres, they are like full tread.
You a driver? For van? Ah, your tourists inside the cave?
Yes.
- Ah, okay. Today not busy, right?
Oh, no.
- I came before on Sunday. It was too busy.
Oh, so many.
- Yeah.
So I come back to... Yeah,
weekend. Many people come from Cebu, from Mindanao.
Yeah, so today is Wednesday.
Okay, let's get our ticket then.
Entrance is 50 and you have to pay 75 if you want to swim.
So apparently you can swim in this cave as well.
I haven't brought any swimming gear so I'm not doing that.
One ticket, please. Thank you.
And a possible trademark infringement at this burger shop.
We've got the McBeef, the McPork, the McEverything.
I don't know, do McDonald's own the rights to the
name Mc when it comes to anything to do with a burger or what?
Or can you actually call it a McBeef?
Oh, this guy again.
Yeah, last time.
Now not so many people. What?
How much?
- Last time, last time, last time. You gave me.
It was the other guy. He was the guy that came after
me, trying to offer me for 150 after I paid 200 for this one.
Hinagdanan cave and bath resort. Yeah,
so apparently it's somewhere you can swim as well.
Some juice sir, later.
Yeah, when I come out I will get a smoothie from you.
Okay, I nearly tripped there.
It's a bit bumpy here.
Hi guys, how are you?
Hello sir, good afternoon.
Good, not too busy today, right?
Good.
- So please write your name sir.
Name, okay.
Here, my name?
- Yes.
You're going to swim, sir?
No, I'm not gonna swim.
You here, last time.
Yeah, I was here, here was too busy,
so I went away and now I come back now.
Yeah.
- Yeah, good. Now it's quite quiet, right?
What's your name again sir?
- Dale.
You look familiar to me.
- Dale.
Yeah.
- You do blogs, sir?
Okay. Yeah, Dale Philip blog.
Okay.
Nice one. Okay, I'll go in now.
Hi.
- Shout out.
Shout out to this guy. What's your name?
Janelle.
- Shout out to Janelle. Shout out.
Oh, wow, it's a small space. Look at this.
But they've built handrails and such like.
Looks very dark. I don't know how much you
guys are gonna be able to see in here, guys, but,
let's check it out.
Let's check it out.
Oh, it's really, really wet.
I would advise bringing hiking shoes if you come here.
I have hiking shoes on right
now, but you can see it's like a...
Well there's handrails and
stuff but it's gonna be slippery.
Guys, I'm gonna switch to my phone.
Maybe it'll be better in low light than the GoPro
because I can't see anything through the viewfinder.
Okay, that's better guys. I'm on my
phone, now so I'm filming with the Note 20 Ultra
and the camera's much better in low light than the GoPro.
I'm actually able to see
something here, guys. It is still very dark.
It's very dark in person, as well, but
it is just this big cave and you can go swimming
but I don't know, there's like hundreds of
tourists every day swimming in this. Imagine the bacteria,
the viruses in this water. It's not
like they chlorinate it like a swimming pool
and I don't think it's, I think it's just
rainwater or water that drips down through the cave,
so it's stagnant as well. I
do not fancy taking a dip in here.
Hi. Just gonna squeeze past. Yeah, but it looks
like, guys, that would be the main reason to come here.
There's nothing really to do if you just come here
and don't swim. It's just like, it really is just a cave.
It's just a cave guys and it's...
Yeah, oh there's like holes in the top.
I guess that's where the water's coming from.
It's just all the rainwater dripping down.
Yeah, everyone's coming here to
swim. I just think it's gonna be filthy.
The water looks clear but, I
don't know, it's stagnant water, isn't it?
This isn't like, it's not coming from a river or
anything like that. It's just the rainwater dripping down,
here, into the cave. Wow, I'm glad I didn't
wait the 20 minutes or whatever it was or longer. Hi.
I'm glad I didn't wait to get in the last time when it was
really busy because, yeah,
especially if it was packed full of people,
I would have been really disappointed
to just basically see the inside of a cave.
It is nice but, I dunno, it's not somewhere
that you want to go out of your way to come and see.
More like somewhere you
would stop off on your bike when you're
going to somewhere else like the
Chocolate Hills or something like that.
Guys. Okay. This is the first time I've filmed a
vlog with my phone since the very first vlog that I ever made.
Like two years before I made the second vlog
that I made, I filmed the whole thing on my Samsung S7.
And this, I don't know how I turn this
around to film myself. It's like, the way I'm holding it.
I need like a stick like I have for the GoPro. Hello.
I'm not filming up your skirt. I'm not doing Japanese style.
This is a big step, maam. Your head, maam.
Hello. I'm fine, thank you.
- How are you? Good.
You did not go swimming?
- No.
Why not?
- I don't know. I
think maybe it's dirty because it's like stagnant water, right?
No, it goes out to the sea.
- Oh, is it sea water?
It's salt water?
- The fresh and salt water.
Oh, so it comes from the rain?
- No.
The cave has like a lagoon. There's
a fresh water and the sea water comes from it.
- Yeah.
Ah, so it's flowing. It's not stagnant?
Yeah.
- Ah, right. Okay, that's good information.
It just looks dirty because there's people swimming.
- Okay. Yeah.
The people make it dirty.
- Yeah, the people make it dirty. Yeah.
Yeah, the dirt's coming from the people, not from the water.
- The pee.
The people pee in it.
- Yeah, the kids especially, right?
When the water goes a bit yellow, you know, it's
not time to jump in.
- Yes, sir.
I see a bat or something.
Yeah.
Ah, so there are local guides. I didn't get a guide.
They're like taking photos and stuff. I
don't need selfies or anything, guys, or photos.
I just take my videos. It's good
enough for me for the travel memories. Okay.
Oh, there's bats. A bat just
flew right by my head. Yeah, there's little bats.
Okay. Sorry, guys. My turn to get out.
Thank you.
Thanks.
- Thank you for coming, sir.
Thank you.
- Hello.
Hi.
Bye-bye, sir.
Hello, handsome.
- Okay
I'll get a smoothie.
Yes, sir. What do you want, sir?
- There are multiple shops. Oh, I was about
to get it from here, but I think I promised this lady.
I'm waiting here.
- I promised you I'd come to
you, right? I was about to go there.
Because you're more friendly than your
competitors. That's why you're getting all the business.
- No, she's just a serious person.
- Ah.

Have fun in Bohol.
Have a safe journey back to Davao. Okay.
Hey, yeah, he gave me it, before.
No, already, already. Sudah.
Okay, time to get this bike back. See you, guys.
Time to get this bike back and I need to fill it with gas,
petrol,
before I take it back.
Otherwise I'm gonna get fined, I think.
This is what I want, right here.
Petrol. I've no idea what kind of petrol this takes.
So I'll have to ask the guys, here.
Hi brother. How are you?
I'm fine.
- I don't know what type.
I don't know the type. Maybe you know.
Ah, okay, okay. Yeah, cause it's rental.
Rental bike.
Ah, okay.
- You know? It's 91? Okay.
How much, sir?
Eh, full. I need it full. To the top, yeah.
Start at zero.
- Okay.
Let's make it 250 pesos.
- Okay, that's good. Okay.
So about 250 pesos.
That's the price per litre there. 66.88.
And I got 3.7 litres. Okay,
thank you, so much, guys. Thank you.
Yeah, I think the price of the petrol here is not much cheaper than it is in the UK.
A lot of countries I go to, the petrol is quite cheap.
Especially when I'm in Dubai.
That's where it's the cheapest.
But in Philippines it seems a
little bit more expensive than other places.
This bike rental place, it's here somewhere.
I'm already here on the map.
Is it here? Oh, here it is.
Oh, they're closed.
They're closed? What am I supposed to do?
Oh, man.
Oh, man, the phone just goes to...
It just rings out, basically. It
rings out and then it goes doo, doo, doo.
Hmm. I wonder if the
business next door, know anything about it.
Oh, it's you. Okay.
I was trying to phone you but
your phone was switched off or something.
I'm driving.
Ah, okay. He just turned up.
I was just about to leave.
I tried to phone him like 3
times and I wasn't getting through.
Did you just go for lunch or something?
You, you went for lunch or something?
Oh, you were picking it up? Ah, okay.
Somebody must have got their bike picked up from their hotel.
I filled it up with gas.
Okay.
- Yeah, it's full. Ah, okay. You want to check it?
Yeah, everything is fine. Perfect condition.
Your raincoat is inside. I didn't use it.
The rain jacket is inside the seat. I didn't use it.
Thank you.
All good? Okay, see you
next time. Okay, cheers. Okay, good.
All's well that ends well. What's that?
Where's your hotel?
Henann.
Yeah, just that Henann down there. Yeah.
Okay, nice one bro. Cheers.
Okay, that's good.
Thought I was gonna end up having to go back to my
hotel and then come back again later when it's raining.
Like I said, I waited all day for the rain
to stop and the forecast is for more rain soon so
this was like the window where I could
do it, where I could go and visit that cave,
fill it up with gas and bring it
back and it worked out perfectly guys.
Now to get this piece of junk off.
And I think it was about
here where I started the vlog off so
again, I'm finishing the vlog right where
I started at and now I'm going back to my resort to
go for a wee swim, maybe have a massage,
have some snacks in the executive lounge. Aye!
I'm gonna enjoy myself, whatever I do, guys, as always.
So, take care. Thanks for joining me on this bicycle
adventure and I will see you on the next one.
Hi bro, how are you? Good. Okay.
