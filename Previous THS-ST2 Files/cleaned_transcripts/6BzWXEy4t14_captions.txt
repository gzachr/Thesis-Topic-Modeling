 
For me, I started going online, and because
I've been looking for two or three years. 
I just started looking and then 
Started doing my homework.
I like the culture in the Philippines. 
The people, I think they're beautiful 
and they're family-oriented.
And, when you started to 
write what were your criteria? 
Are there any criteria you were like age or...
Initially, my age was older as I 
started reading more about that. 
For me, my oldest daughter is 27 and she 
told me as long as she's older than 27 then. 
That's acceptable.
And how old are you Donna?
I'm 33
You're 33?
A beautiful girl at 33, wow!
And you have what a daughter or
Ah! She's five years old.
That's really a very good time. 
To bring her out of the country at that age.
Yes.
So that was part of the idea. 
I've seen her daughter because I raised two girls.
She has a beautiful daughter!
Thank you!
And when did you realize that 
you got a connection with Donna?
For me, probably July 4th but when 
I initially went to the profiles, 
It was because of their beautiful eyes...
Oops!
That's what got me open and read her profile.
Beautiful eyes.
Eyes kind of went from there.
She was,
She wrote me every day and I know her better.
So I knew before I came over you know and of 
course, I was scared because I'm in divorce.
So now,
Have you met her family?
Oh yeah! First night.
As you promised in your letters 
meeting her for the first time.
Well, for me is I was.
I was very emotional 
When I went through a house they all greeted 
me, gave everybody hugs, and took me into 
A little daughter because 
I called her precious and 
I knelt down and she was sleeping 
and now they were all doing.
Here's daddy, here's daddy!
So, you have the sign that is it.
That was a very good sign that 
This is what you want.
I can feel that he has a good heart.
I will love him unconditionally and forever.
Is your family supportive of what you're doing?
Yeah!
His children are very supportive.
And did you propose to her yet?
I have to go back, talk to her mom and dad.
Okay, that's awesome!
