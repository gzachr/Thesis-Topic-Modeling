We've done in about [ten] minutes [to] [act] on the steps to the view deck this
Here that I'm pointing at with my umbrella
Like a wise person is ironwood
Supposedly is very hard wood
We came here for the sunset
It's cloudy however there is literally just an opening there, and you can see the rays of light
I think the water it's amazing
So this was the sunset hike, but clearly the sunset is covered when we get down. We're going to go swim with the sharks
Over there. They said it's a 45-minute swim come on. We all know we can do it in five

Finally reached the end of the runway [with] an hour [soon] [with] the main home
without where after this ride with the tricycle
Which is actually a site [that] I've been told off for following it that is called practical work
So if you consider all these little black school van veritas because some sort of festival called Viesta is real time
So people love the fiesta here

Was walking down the street and everyone was pointing at the dirty ice cream?
And I was wondering why the cold dirty and it's simply because it's on the stage
But it really just ice cream, so nice [let's] try it out

So one of them is the regular which is a funky losing pink one
And then the special [one] which is this cone the Brahman which is the sweet sweet and one and here we have the [flavored]

And I've noticed [that] here in the provinces in the philippines a lot of people just
Sell their stuff
Industry like this gentleman here Shannon watches into the balloon
and fall very inventive here in cases of selling bracelets and
snacks here, we can see the look of
cheap food the affordable option looks very very tasty

There's a [hole] 100 meters of Shallow water the mixture of soap water and fresh water

We are thrown back in time

So this is why this place is called Snake island because of that the true meaning of [awesome] [filthy] before
