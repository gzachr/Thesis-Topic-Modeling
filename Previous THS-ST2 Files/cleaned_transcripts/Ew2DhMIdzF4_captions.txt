White Beach, the main tourism beach, is about four kilometers long and is lined with resorts
hotels, lodging houses, restaurants, and other tourism-related businesses.
In the central portion, for about two kilometers, there is a footpath known
as the Beachfront Path separating the beach itself from the establishments located along it.
North and south of the Beachfront Path,
beachfront establishments do literally front along the beach itself.
Several roads and paths connect the Beachfront Path with Boracay's Main Road,
a vehicular road which runs the length of the island.
