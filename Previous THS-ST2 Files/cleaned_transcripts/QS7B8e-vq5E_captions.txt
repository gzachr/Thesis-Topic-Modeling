somehow here in the Philippines we always end up 
in a shopping mall yeah we'll have a little wander  
around this one seems quite big as well so yeah 
the water garden water garden and Carousel Court
okay so first things first is to find out where 
this concert is being held and if we have to buy  
tickets or if we have to do anything because 
we really don't want to miss that that was the  
whole point I'm coming out today uh that and of 
course a jersey which hopefully we will be able  
to find yeah I mean it looks like it's a free free 
concert although I think you can pay extra to get  
tickets like close up to the stage so let's find 
an information board yeah wow a really nice spot  
we have some Market here hello
and snacks and we have toys so yeah this 
is a beautiful little Center area malls are  
massive the malls here are incredible 
I can't believe how big the malls are
okay girls okay we heard that there's like a 
concert happening today at the mall um our our  
host just let us know about the concert today so 
I don't know can you buy tickets or do we have to  
a singular sit mom or two accumulated receipt 
for three thousand from restaurants so we have  
to spend 3 000 per person in the restaurant in the 
mall today I don't have that big of an appetite
mechanics
and so is there like an open area where we 
can just go and not have like a seat and  
listen is okay so where would we do that 
and we can just be with a group of people
to our food market area here I'm 
not sure if this is always here  
um or not if we've not been to this Market we're 
actually kind of hungry so we're probably gonna  
get a little something oh yes apparently

be featuring a lot of local Filipino talents
