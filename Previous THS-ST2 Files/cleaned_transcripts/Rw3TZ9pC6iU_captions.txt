hey everyone it's michael here again and welcome 
back to another one of our videos in this videos  
what we're going to be talking about is pretty 
much some basic customs that filipinas have that  
you as a foreigner should know if you're deciding 
to come down here to the philippines to be either  
meet a wife to find your girlfriend or 
just to come here to actually just have  
some fun so that's what we're going to be talking 
about in this video now before we even get started  
you know let me ask you guys to please don't 
forget to subscribe to this channel and also  
make sure you click the bell icon to notify you 
of new videos coming up every week in this channel  
now our main goal here in this channel is to be 
able to you know help out foreigners and expats  
like myself who decided to move to the philippines 
or if you're deciding to just you know come visit  
the philippines to like i said meet that wife 
that girlfriend or just have some clear fun  
here in the philippines so you definitely need to 
know some of the basic customs so that you don't  
that you might actually find weird um being done 
in the philippines and it's a good thing that you  
guys actually know this so the first one i want to 
be able to talk about are that you know filipinos  
you know if they want to grab your attention 
you know is that they will either hiss or say or  
right use the words or that you know if 
they're calling you they're not gonna  
or you're gonna hear them say hi right 
instead of hey right you're gonna say  
you know a good way to know if a person's filipino 
let's say you're you're in america right now  
you know a good trick to do if you see a 
filipino is do this and you're gonna see  
a filipino literally turn around more than 
likely you know i mean if you're american  
um and somebody does that you're not really gonna 
look here because you know you're used to somebody  
either saying hey how are you or somebody calling 
out your name but just the basics or hiss will  
get a filipino's attention easily right so that's 
one thing that you should definitely get used to  
you know as a foreigner because a filipino might 
actually do that to you as well the next thing is  
showing directions a lot of filipinos will show 
you directions or point something with you with  
their lips they're gonna they're gonna pucker 
up and they're gonna say over there you know hey  
can you pick up that thing that thing no you know 
what do you want me to pick up that thing you know  
that thing pick up that thing and put over there 
put it over there right so they will literally  
use your puckered lips to be able to point in 
certain things so it's kind of weird sometimes and  
you know you have to get used to that but that 
is it's guaranteed ask any filipino that you  
just meet whether you're in the us whether you're 
in europe in italy in france wherever if you're  
in australia if you're in asia somewhere 
filipinos use their lips to actually point  
directions all right so you guys should definitely 
know that um also another thing is you know  
filipinos consider staring really rude um it's 
a rude thing to do but filipinos like to stare  
it's rude they say but you know it's rude if 
you're staring it's rude if you stare at me  
but if i stare at you well you know just deal 
with it right filipinos will just literally say  
that you know they they don't like people staring 
at them they feel weird but they love staring at  
people when they see something right um so that's 
kind of weird for me um the next one is you know  
women you know you'll notice this is a lot of 
women you know they often walk down the streets  
holding hands with other women right and men you 
can see actually filipino males you know embrace  
each other and you know have their arms against 
each other around each other when they're walking  
down the street now just because you see this 
you know don't all of a sudden be like oh my god  
my gaydar is going on look at these gay people 
or you know having some homophobic feelings um  
you know what it's not um it's just typical 
it's something it's something that's acceptable  
in the philippines um also you know this one 
um is just a is a an add-on to this a little  
topic um if you are homophobic which nowadays you 
know what shouldn't be but if you are philippines  
is not the place for you because i'll tell you 
one thing um you know the freedom that a lot of  
gay people have in the philippines is is pretty 
much acceptable and so you know gay men here are  
what you would use the term in the states 
as flaming hot right flaming hot cheetos um  
and you know hey they're just they they're just 
comfortable with who they are and you know you're  
going to see that here if you watch any movies in 
the philippines guarantee there's going to be some  
gay guys in there gary if you watch for example 
tv shows in the philippines there's always going  
to be a gay actor who's just like straight up you 
know out there and outlandish um heck one of the  
most famous um actors and and tv hosts out here 
in the philippines is this is this guy whose name  
is vice gandha right gundam means beautiful you 
know and this person is like always straight up  
on makeup hair is on point clothing is you know 
is is you know you know on point as well and so  
you know it's just natural here so if you have if 
you have a homophobic tendencies you know you're  
probably having a seizure here in the philippines 
at times and i'll guarantee you one thing the girl  
that you're end up dating the girl that you end up 
marrying one of her best friends is a straight up  
gay person who gives her the advice you may not 
like that person you you know but you know what  
that person is their gay best friend everyone here 
has a gay best friend heck even guys have gay best  
friends here so that's just a natural thing so 
once again if you're a dude if you're if you're  
a foreigner an expert and all of a sudden you have 
these homophobic tendencies you know you're going  
to be complaining a lot here in the philippines 
so get used to it um also understand that you know  
if you're in a relationship with somebody you 
know holding hands in public you know having  
your arms over a person isn't acceptable what 
they call pda or it's pretty much you know public  
displays of affections um but you know the whole 
grabbing ass you know the whole you know grabbing  
some boobies or something like that or just like 
straight up like making out in front of everybody  
it's something that is not socially acceptable i 
mean it's not really socially acceptable really  
in anywhere in the world you know but it's it 
you know it is more unacceptable here in the  
philippines that doesn't mean it doesn't happen 
um and especially during the daytime here but you  
know if you're in a club even your bar is accepted 
i guess i mean if you if you know you have a few  
drinks here and there it's going to happen anyways 
right but a lot of filipinas you know they don't  
want to feel embarrassed or make it look like 
that they're um what we call a [ __ ] right  
um and pogba means like a prostitute and so 
especially you know if you're a foreigner  
you're an expat and you're with a filipina you 
know unfortunately there is this um there is this  
bias of people saying oh look at that girl she's 
with that guy you know she's probably a prostitute  
she's probably a pokeball because what they 
call or they'll probably say oh she's just  
you know you know he's just using her for sex 
or she's just using him so she can get a visa  
everyone will have their comments that they want 
to say and a lot of filipinos don't don't want  
people talking about them even though the fact 
that they don't know them and i always tell people  
it's like you know who gives a crap what people 
tell you know talk about you if you don't know  
them you should not even entertain that those type 
of negativity or make it affect you but you know  
filipinos can be you know easily offended and you 
know so don't put your filipina in that type of a  
situation so you know holding hands fine holding 
your arms over you know grabbing ass you know no  
uh maybe a light tap here and there if nobody's 
looking i guess is okay you know have that's a  
little playful but don't be straight up you know 
trying to look for for gold up in the booty um  
if you're in public with your filipino right 
um next thing is you know filipinos actually  
love to love a good time love humor and you know 
they love to laugh and love to smile and you know  
especially when they're embarrassed filipinos will 
literally start smiling and laughing when they're  
embarrassed and a lot of times when filipinos 
are kind of you know smiling and embarrassed  
other than smiling and laughing they're actually 
going to cover their mouth like you know if you  
see filipinos in public when when they smile 
and they laugh they're actually covering their  
mouth when they're doing that um i you know i 
never really asked a person why they do that  
um but that's something that you'll actually see i 
mean like in the states for example if somebody's  
laughing they're just like chucking laughing 
out loud mouth open everywhere right male or  
female but in the philippines you know they cover 
their mouth when they're laughing they're like  
whatever right um so that's something that 
you're going to notice a lot here as well  
the next thing is that you should know about 
filipinos especially filipinas as filipinos love  
taking photographs there's it's like they want to 
photograph everything um you know philippines is  
known as the selfie capital of the world you know 
and filipinos love taking selfies i'm not one of  
those people that love taking selfies first of all 
i'm a guy so you know a guy that who takes a lot  
of selfies to me is just straight up vain and you 
got some problems in your head and actually you  
know with that study of talking about filipinos 
are um are is a selfie capital world was included  
in that study was that you know vanity is such a 
big thing in the philippines i guess and you know  
because that's part of it of wanting to see how 
how you look good right taking picture let me see  
if i look good yeah that's not good enough let me 
take another picture you know and that study came  
about during the early 2000s before a lot of the 
um social media platforms became more about video  
and so now with instagram and with tick tock 
and stuff like that i mean it's all out there  
you know dancing fun of videos making memes 
making all these different things so filipinos  
love taking selfies so yeah and photographs so 
get ready if you're with your significant other  
that they're going to want to photograph the whole 
thing you know if you let's say you're arriving in  
the airport trust me if you're filipino's picking 
you up at the airport she's videotaping that  
you know one thing that filipinos love like you 
see you're gonna see a lot this in youtube for  
example is what they call ldr's first meets you 
know long distance relationship first meetings  
and filipinos love to post that because they want 
to share what they have they want to share what's  
going on with them so that's something that you're 
actually going to be able to have to tolerate  
next thing is other than public displays of 
affections pdas filipinas also don't like to  
display anger and strong emotions you know and 
it does happen you know so let's say you know  
they don't want to have this big fight in 
public because once again they don't want  
people seeing what's happening those are things 
that should happen inside the house you know  
in closed doors um don't let people see what's 
going on right you're a filipina she may be a  
sexual person but you know going back to the whole 
pda stuff she may be you know somebody who's just  
amazing and very sexual and very affectionate 
in the in the house but she doesn't want that  
to be seen in public because she doesn't 
want people to think of her differently  
and have kind of a thought or statement about her 
or you as well the other thing is you also know  
basic things you should know also about the basic 
culture and communication the philippines is that  
you know let's say for example you're gonna tell 
somebody to come over you know just like how they  
like to point with the lips right you know never 
call somebody with their with your index finger  
meaning that you know never never do this hey 
come here i mean even in the states that's very  
rude but in the philippines it's even more 
brutal me like you know you look at a person  
you point at them and you're like come here come 
here like don't do that to filipinos because that  
can be very offensive for them and you know once 
again it's like it's like you treating them like  
um like a slave or treating them like a low caste 
person like hey come here now if if you know if  
they can't hear you trying to gesture to a person 
to have them come see you or come closer to you  
instead of doing this or doing this right put 
your palms down and do this hey come here come  
here come here that's more of a proper gesture 
if you're trying to do a non-verbal body language  
you know calling somebody to come over here 
hey come here that's more of like i'm patting  
you it's okay come over here right so that's the 
best way to actually call somebody non-verbally  
and not with the index finger um another 
thing is also you know because there's  
a lot of closed tight spaces going on in the 
philippines everything's cramped up a little bit  
if two people are talking um talking to each other 
and they're face to face and you literally have  
no place to walk through you can't even go to 
the left you can't go to the right right my best  
suggestion is you know you don't want to pass 
between them it's actually very rude you need  
to do everything you can to go around them because 
they're having a conversation if you have no other  
choice but to go between them you have to say 
excuse me now in the u.s or under other parts of  
the world you say excuse me they stop talking you 
pass through and then they start conversing again  
you need to do an extra step here if you're going 
to be walking through between two people who are  
having a conversation you're going to either put 
your hands together you say and bow your head and  
say excuse me and you're going to go below their 
head and walk through so that they still have eye  
contact it's just one of the polite things to do 
you say excuse me bro right and then you just walk  
through you still bend your you bend your your 
body and bow down a little bit and kind of pretty  
much ducking yourself and making sure that you're 
not allowing them to lose eye contact between  
each other okay it's just a a mutual sign of 
respect for them the next thing you should  
know is that filipinos you know they really use a 
lot of non-verbal communications you know raising  
eyebrows is one thing that they're gonna you 
know actually do if they're trying to you know  
use eyebrow just to say yes you know 
did you go to did you go to church  
yes right and sometimes you know people are 
like no well talk to me tell me is it yes or no
yes right they use a lot of non-verbal and so you 
know some of us in the western world were like no  
we want the yes and the no answer we don't want 
the maybe we don't want this whatever with your  
eye stuff but a lot of filipinos will do that um 
moving on to other things that you should know  
in the philippines i mean this is something in 
um like in the u.s and stuff like that you know  
if let's say i'm going inside the gas station 
and i'm walking in you know when i open at that  
door myself if somebody i see somebody behind 
me i'm going to literally keep the door open  
for them so that they can actually walk in and 
typically they're going to say thank you so much  
for you know thank you you know or if i'm walking 
out i'll hold the door or at least you know if i  
don't have time to hold the door enough for them 
to come because they're a little bit farther  
um i'm literally going to show them that i'm 
going to push door a little bit further just  
so that it remains open for them but in the 
philippines you know um for some reason um  
don't expect them to say thank you um it's really 
weird um and it kind of irked me a little bit  
um in the beginning uh it's just that i'm like 
why aren't you saying thank you um but that's  
just how it is uh and don't expect anything 
of that and at the same time don't think that  
they're disrespecting you by not saying thank you 
it's more of like listen i don't know you i don't  
have a conversation with you you know i mean they 
may bow their head and say thank you that way but  
you're not gonna hear a verbal thank you from them 
um as much sometimes you will but most of the time  
i guarantee that you guys won't so don't expect 
that another thing is also is in in in this in  
this country is that a lot of people don't really 
have a regard to um basic laws i guess of of um  
i don't know walking in a way i'll say people 
always try to butt in front of you in regards to a  
line that's normally expected um another thing is 
just you know this will happen to you a lot you're  
about to get onto an escalator and you know in 
the u.s or in the western world when you're about  
to get into an escalator you know people start 
funneling themselves and they say okay i know you  
kind of walked in front of me first i'll let you 
go it's my turn now here you're about to literally  
step into the escalator and somebody will try 
to butt in front of you and get in front of you  
right away it's the weirdest thing that you guys 
are going to be expecting here in the philippines  
another thing you might you know you have to 
understand is that traffic here is crazy like  
you know in the u.s for example you have three 
lanes right and there's those lines that separate  
the lanes in in you know in the and the road um 
here in the philippines if there were three lanes  
they'll make that three lanes into five lanes 
plus a motorcycle lane right um it's pretty crazy  
so you just need to be able to get used to the and 
accustomed to things that are going on here in the  
philippines and at the very same time it's like 
listen you're in a different country you're not  
in your country so you can't expect other people 
to follow the laws of how it is in your country  
you have to be respectful of what goes on in this 
country and just accept it for what it is and try  
not to let it bother you as well but you know i 
hope you know some of the stuff that i actually  
shared in this video kind of hits you a little 
bit and you can say okay i understand now so that  
you know if you face this when you come here 
to the philippines for the first time or maybe  
you know you've been here before and it used to 
irk you when you've seen certain things like that  
you know now at least you know that you know this 
is a common thing this is not something that just  
happened to you that somebody which is being you 
know being crappy to you or anything like that  
um but at the same time it allows you to be able 
to know you know things that happens here that's  
normal that's a normalcy thing here so i hope
