Why is his voice similar with Bruno Mars? guys...
Oh...My goodness...
Gosh...His voice is so melodious...
I really love it the most when he screams like that with high notes...
Wearing a white shirt...
His face is handsome...

His voice is exactly and very similar like Bruno Mars...My goodness...
Like Bruno Mars himself who sings...

Can already be on par guys...With Bruno Mars...
Now we look at the second one...
We'll see who has the highest voice between Sejun and Stell...
Stell loses...
Oh...It's a low notes...
He wants to join too, I think...
Sejun loses...
What to do with his hand, roughly..
Looks like Sejun's face is already scared...
Oh...My goodness...
A lot of fur on his hands guys...
My goodness...Poor Sejun is pain guys...
My goodness...How funny they both are...
That's the high note challenge...
Hmmm...As usual...
His voice is like this...
Really good...Amazing...So cool...
So between they both, of course the one who wins is my Stell...
Yeah...Even though Sejun loses but poor his hand earlier...
Until he wants to cry when his fur was pulled...
but the fur was really much...
and earlier, there was Justin also who seems wants to join high note challenge...
Can he do it?
Stell's voice, indeed really good...
Soft notes he can...
High note he can...
