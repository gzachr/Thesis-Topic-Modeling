- The island of Boracay
will be officially closed.
Now, it was a shocking decision
that was made roughly six months ago.
They will close down one of the most
well-visited and profitable islands
in the entire Philippines.
It was a business decision that would cost
some nearly eight billion dollars.
- But why?
- Now why would they do that?
(upbeat music)
The main reason it got shut
down was basically this:
Boracay, for the longest time,
has been a place of tourism.
It has quickly boomed
into what it is today,
and a lot of the businesses
were not complying
with the regulations, such
as disposal of sewage.
One of the biggest issues was
actually a little disgusting,
was that they were just
basically dumping their sewage
directly onto the beaches
that many of the tourists
were also swimming in.
- Eww.
- Yeah, "eww" was right.
The president was actually quoted
calling the island a cesspool.
- Boracay is a cesspool.
- His words, not mine.
Now, I've been to Boracay, it's beautiful.
Was it filthy?
Yes, a little bit.
It wasn't the cleanest island.
And so, to their credit,
they actually ended up
making a very tough decision
to close the island down completely,
100% switching off the valve.
No tourists are permitted
inside of Boracay for
the six-month period,
to try to get it on the right track.
So Cathy and I, hello,
we're going to Boracay today
to see if it was all worth it.
Let's see if the change has
been real and significant.
Never in my life have I missed a flight
until right now.
(upbeat music)
Well, well, well, fast forward a week
and we are finally here in Boracay
to give you an update on what's new here.
I'm super excited.
We actually just flew in
here with Cebu Pacific.
Typically, Cebu Pacific is my go-to way
to travel the Philippines.
It's usually the most affordable.
They even fly internationally,
which is really cool (mumbles).
But one piece of advice when using them,
is make sure your
carry-on is not overweight
because they do like to weigh it.
First update is we've just
landed in a brand-new airport.
This is the new Boracay arrivals airport.
The departures are still done
in the old Caticlan airport.
There's only a couple of
airlines that land in here,
with Cebu Pacific being one of them.
That's one of the
advantages to landing here
because the other Boracay airport
will probably take you
about an hour and a half
to get to the crossing area
where you'll have to take a boat.
So we still take a boat here,
but we're basically already there.
Big change number two.
There is now a requirement
that you have a booking at a hotel
before you arrive on the island.
So this is the form right here.
We're actually at the Coast,
the hotel we'll be staying at.
They have their own little
private boarding area
with their own private boat,
but they are making me
fill out the same form
that you'd be filling out
regardless of what hotel you stay at.
Now, what's the implications of that?
Really, it just means that
if you're a backpacker
and you just plan to,
like, stroll on to Boracay,
kinda wander around, find a guest house,
figure out what hostel you
wanna stay at last minute,
like I would typically
do, you can't do that.
They will not let you on the island
unless you have a confirmed booking
from a hotel, a guest house,
something of that sort,
which is really interesting.
Once you've filled out your form
and you're ready to go, I just realized
they give you the mark of the beast.
This is verifying on it.
It's just basically saying
that you've confirmed
that you actually are staying in a hotel.
So, if your hotel doesn't include
transportation to and from the island,
then what you'll be taking is the ferry.
It runs fairly frequently,
but I have heard
that they've reduced the frequency
with the re-opening of Boracay, so.
- (mumbles) towel.
- Thank you very much.
Coast guard requirement.
We have five minutes to get there.
We are back and quickly reminded
why this place is so famous.
It was always incredibly beautiful.
Blue water, the white
sand is some of the best.
I know I say that a lot, but it truly is,
it's some of the best.
And the last transportation
means one more car.
So, we are now on the main road,
and we're seeing a ton of
construction that's going on.
Basically, they're building
it so it's two lanes wide,
whereas before, it was
one tiny, tiny lane,
where everyone has to,
like, sneak by each other.
It was absolutely chaotic if you ever had
to go through Boracay.
There's a lot of construction
going on here right now.
And we are back at my
favorite hotel in Boracay.
Guys, this is the Coast.
So happy to be back here.
It's clean, it's bright, it's modern.
We're pretty much gonna go to bed now
and tomorrow, we'll show you around,
to show you the new Boracay.
Good morning, guys, and welcome to
Day number one here in Boracay.
I'm got my tourist shirt on,
and I'm ready to share some information
about the new Boracay,
'cause a lot has changed.
The new rules state that there can't be
anything on the beach.
So there can't be chairs.
There can't be any fences
dividing properties.
There can't be lights on the trees.
And so, that means that basically,
if you're gonna hang out by the beach,
you just have that beautiful white sand
and that blue, blue water.
There used to be tons and tons
of lounge chairs all along this beach.
Now, there's nothing.
I think it's actually a really nice thing,
like I thought that the chairs
were a total eyesore before.
And there used to be so many vendors here
trying to sell you day trips,
trying to sell you, like,
snacks and massages,
and it was just really annoying.
You come to a beach like this to relax,
and it wasn't really the
experience last time.
So, I think they've
completely cleaned that up.
Speaking of cleaning up,
this is what you see everywhere.
It had become a barefoot destination.
You can walk anywhere barefoot now.
- It's very nice.
Actually, you can see police.
Policeman's everywhere.
And I guess it's to enforce that
people don't sell (mumbles) on the street.
- And they're truly cleaning
up after everything.
Even the leaves that fall from the palms,
I see people just scooping it all up.
It's just like immaculate right now.
It's the perfect clean beach,
and I'm surprised to see that.
So my fellow sandcastle lovers out there,
I have some bad news for you,
because digging a
sandcastle here in Boracay
can now lead to a $50 fine,
and not to mention there's actually been
some videos of police coming
and knocking them down.
Hopefully, that doesn't happen here today.
So, the water here is just
about the cleanest I've seen.
It's so crystal clear,
and there's not a single bit of litter.
One of the really awesome new rules
that they've implemented here
is that there's no
smoking in Boracay at all.
I mean, there's no more of those
little cigarette butts getting everywhere.
There's also another rule, which is
no drinking anymore in public.
That'll result in a cleaner environment,
but, I don't know if it's all positive,
because it's definitely kind of nice
to be able to walk around with a beer.
That's definitely a social
atmosphere thing that I enjoy,
but I guess it's for the environment here,
and that's definitely the direction
they've chosen with the new Boracay.
(upbeat music)
Well, there is one last
thing I have to warn you
about the water if you're in Boracay,
that they have these
really horrible leeches,
and once they grab on to you, they just,
it's really hard to get off.
- Yeah?
- You either gotta use fire or salt.
You know, I could talk about
the facts of Boracay all day,
but I've been to the (mumbles).
I think the best way to show
is just to show it for what it is.
A place to relax, amazing food.
(squealing)
(upbeat music)
Since the changes, this is
a truly world-class beach.
Now, there's one thing that
didn't change about Boracay
and that is good food.
(upbeat music)
- I just got my shake and
it remind me something
that I have to tell you about Boracay.
So they have (mumbles) here.
So they have single--
- Single-use plastics.
- Huh?
- Single-use plastics.
- Okay, single-use plastic.
- Using water bottles.
- Okay.
No straws and no bags,
and a lot of (mumbles)
are not using any more water bottles,
which I think is fair because they
contaminate the environment.
You get service water like this.
- Now, there's one thing the Philippines
does better than any other country,
and that is without a doubt their sunsets.
Every single night, night after night,
you can expect to see beautiful infernos,
incredible clouds, and
tonight is no exception.
We just finished up dinner
at the Coast Restaurant
and no more than 10 feet away,
we are right on the beach,
enjoying a world-class sunset.
Tonight is a piece de resistance.
(mellow music)
It's right here, it's
probably the biggest change
that you will see here in Boracay.
We went out last night.
We walked down the main
promenade behind the palm trees.
Basically, everything
becomes pretty sleepy.
Not only with Boracay
one of the party capitals
of the country, but they actually had
a really big event called LaBoracay,
which was typically leading up to, like,
New Years and Christmas time.
Now that event has been
completely closed this year.
And I have a feeling they're
probably not planning
to continue it ever again.
It seems like the
nightlife side of Boracay
is something they're trying
to totally dissociate themselves with.
And I'm not sure it's ever coming back.
Hey, you over there, stop partying.
What is Boracay gonna
look like moving forward?
Well, the future is
definitely very uncertain.
One thing that has been announced is
they're actually planning to implement
e-vehicles, including cars and tricycles,
to get people around the new
main road they're building.
So, this is definitely an interesting
sustainability push that they're making.
They're obviously investing real money
into making this all happen.
Maybe they're trying to rebrand Boracay
into this very sustainable island.
It's definitely an interesting push
in the right direction.
Now, here's where things get interesting.
It's actually been quoted
by a few of the officials,
that Boracay is actually
just the first island
that they plan to do this on.
There's going to be many
more island clean-ups coming.
And so, I'm sure that has business owners
all around the Philippines
probably trembling in their shoes,
because let's face it,
this is a scary thing to deal with.
As a business owner, having your island
completely shut down indefinitely
is the last thing you want.
Now, with that being said,
they haven't exactly said
where it will be next,
but based on my experience
in the Philippines,
there's one place that
immediately comes to mind
and that is El Nido.
El Nido is just like Boracay in the sense
that it was a tourism hub that grew up
a little too quickly, it grew faster
than the infrastructure
could keep up with,
and it definitely doesn't seem as though
most people are following code.
I think a lot of pollutants are ending up
right in the ocean.
And so, naturally, I can see that
being the next place to
be completely closed down.
And to be honest, I would say,
from an outsider's perspective,
it kind of needs it.
El Nido went from being one
of my favorites places in the world,
to now being kind of a
secondary recommendation.
The last time I went to El Nido,
the lagoons were just overtaken
by these neon orange kayaks,
and it was a bit of a sore sight.
But at the same time, I definitely think
they're gonna need some
legislation, some rules
to limit how many people are entering
into these lagoons and viewpoints.
Something needs to be done
to protect the ecosystems.
To this day right now,
there's over half of the
hotels completely closed.
They don't have yet their permits.
The same goes for restaurants.
Most of hem are still closed
along the beachfront and inland.
So, a lot of these business owners
are really suffering right now.
They're not making any money.
They have huge overhead of rents.
Some of them are still paying employees.
Now, the employees also suffered a lot.
A lot of them that were
working in businesses
just like this one, had to go find work
for that six-month period,
not knowing exactly when
Boracay would re-open.
So, a lot of people went
back to their home provinces.
They found temporary work,
of course, making a lot less money
than they would have made here.
For the local people that
do call Boracay home,
that have grown up here,
well, they actually had
a program in place where they could
basically do beach clean-up.
They went from making, on average,
like 1,000 to 1,500 pesos a day
to now making around 350 pesos a day.
That's just over $6 to do beach clean-up
and other odd jobs to
get the island ready.
So, overall, a lot of
people really suffered
during these six months.
Is it worth it in the long term?
That is to be decided,
but I'm definitely excited
about some of the new
directions they're taking.
Alright, we are just checking out of one
of my favorite hotels in the entire world.
Bye-bye.
Till next time.
We're leaving the Coast here.
Such an awesome stay.
And this is kind of an interesting update,
so, this morning, there was
like all these helicopters
circling really closely by.
And I was like, that's kind of odd,
considering they've banned all
like the water sport activities,
like, what are the
helicopters doing so close
to the beachfront here?
And so it turns out, that the same person
that closed down this beach, this island,
probably about eight months ago,
is also the one who's now visiting.
President Duterte is
currently here in Boracay.
And so it means we actually have to walk
a little bit farther
to get to our transport
'cause they have the
entire main road closed,
even more closed than it currently is.
So, that leads us to our final question.
Who is Boracay for?
Or at least the new Boracay.
Well, in my opinion,
it's definitely no longer
for those who wanna party.
And it's probably not for people
who are on a budget.
Now, what that leaves you with
is people that wanna relax
by one of the world's
most beautiful beaches
and one of the beaches
that's now being preserved
better than, I would say,
any island I've seen yet.
It's definitely an incredible
place to come and relax.
It's also not really for people
that wanna have true Philippine adventures
as you've probably seen
a lot of on this channel.
You do have a few boat trips available,
or slowly becoming available,
but Boracay is, for the most part,
not the most adventurous island.
It's a place I like to come and relax,
have Internet, have good food,
all the modern conveniences
in a beautiful, beautiful island.
If you wanted to come check it out,
then I think now is a good time to do it
while the tourism is still a little low.
I'm definitely giving it a thumbs up.
I like having less people here.
