crispy Pata

Good
okay
well looking at the menu here I suppose
we have to have Alejandro's crispy pata
since that's the name of the restaurant
right?
all right our food just came out
looks great
smells fantastic, we have our Alejandro's
pata, our crispy pata, we have alejandro
special fried rice, we have the sizzling
Pochero, and we have the vegetable Kare kare
over on the other side here with
our special sauces steaming hot like
once again smells great we're ready to
dig in I'm super starving Naz is super
starving
let's do this
first i'm just
going to try this on its own it's
fantastic I don't want to try any sauces
I just want to have the taste of this
pork in my mouth
explosion in your mouth of juicy
kind of porky goodness
the skin is
crispy without being kind of hard like
it's running it's not difficult to chew
it's great tender,  just falls right off
the bone very rich very very delicious
you have the calamansi here it just
kind of gives it a citrus taste that
cuts through some of that richness and
adds another layer of flavor to it
like vinegar and soy sauce
so i'm going to try some of this crispy Pata
definitely CRISPY
It's a pork Knuckle
I am going to dip some of this in here
you know I'm not usually
a big fan of pork
but this is good
the meat is really moist
and the skin, as you can hear it is really crispy
you have different textures
you have the moistness and the softness of the meat
and crispness of the skin
it's so crispy
so much flavor as well
it's not like
salty or anything like that
I don't know what the flavors are
or the spices that they use
so good
I think the Lechon
the outer skin
is crispy, but it's like smooth
right?
but this has a texture to it
maybe it's like lightly battered
but maybe some kind of starch, like a potato starch to make it dry and crispy
whereas the Lechon
I feel like the skin is a little thicker and it has some kind of give and sponginess to it
where as this, the entire skin is like crisp
there's no other texture but the top layer of the skin is completely crisp
and then underneath that it's just this
moist flesh
super good, did you see the way that just came off?
you don't need to use a knife or anything, i just took my fork
I can just pull it apart with a spoon
I don't know this is like vinegar base sauce
next I'm going to try them sizzling
Pajero which is just a braised beef with
gravy which is eaten over the rice comes
off the bone just really tender
big bite the beef here
that's nice too that's got a roast-beef
sort of consistency but it's a little
sweet that's what almost as if there's
sort of syrup on there there's some most
corn in there with the gravy goes over
the rice
it's not what adds to the sweetness
because there's an additional sweet
syrup in it
that's very nice it's fantastic
