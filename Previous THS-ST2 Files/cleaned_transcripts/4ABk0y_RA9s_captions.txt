I AM STILL MIXING THIS CHICKEN ADOBO WITH
MICHELLE.
SHE OWNS A LOLA'S KUSINA DOES ALL OF THIS
OUT OF HER HOUSE, AND SHE'S MAKING IT PRETTY
SPECIAL.
I KNOW YOU GOT A LOT OF YOUR INFLUENCE FROM
YOUR GRANDMA, BUT I WANT TO GET RIGHT INTO
THE COOKING ASPECT OF IT.
SO WE'RE PUTTING THE CHICKEN INTO THE PAN
JUST TO KIND OF GET IT GOING A LITTLE BIT.

"Once after we got all those flavors marinating,
the Bayley, the peppercorn, the garlic and
the ginger, the soy sauce and the vinegar.
kind of smell that right now and all the aroma
you wish cameras could pick up scent."
"Starting to smell like my Lola's kitchen,
Lola is grandma and grandma and Tagalog, Which
is the what the name of the eatery is named
after and right now Tony has kind of pan frying
getting the flavors going.
And now he's gonna pour the rest of the marinade
on top of the chicken adobo.
And then from there, we go ahead and simmer
it until tender.
And yes, I wish y'all could be here.
Go ahead and we simmer that for about thirty
to forty-five minutes and then after that,
we serve it with a nice bed of rice."
WOW.
SO THIS IS A VERY COMMON DISH WITHIN THE PHILIPPINES.
"It's one of them.
It's the national dish of the Philippines."
WHILE THIS IS COOKING, I WANT TO SHOW FOLKS
THE FINISHED PRODUCT.
YEAH, SO TOTAL COOK TIME.
WHAT'S THE TOTAL COOK TIME
"I would say the total cook time is about
45 minutes.
Prep is about five to 10 minutes and depending
on how long you marinate it, some folks do
an hour some do 12 hours to 24 I like to really
just let it marinate overnight so it really
picks up that umami quintessential Filipino
flavor.
That salt savory sweet and tangy."
WELL, I WANT YOU TO DO ON THE UNVEILING BECAUSE
YOU PUT A LOT OF WORK IN THERE.
SO I WANT YOU TO SHOW IT OFF TO THE VIEWERS.
"Would you grab that?"
YES, ABSOLUTELY.
I'M NOT GONNA SHOW I'M GONNA LET MICHELLE
TAKE THAT OVER AND SHOW OFF THE CHICKEN.
"So here is our chicken adobo right here.
Look at that.
You can kind of see what the bay leaves and
everything has been simmering and marinated
and cook like a stew.
Wow.
Tony, shall we go ahead and sighs absolutely,"
ABSOLUTELY FIRST LADIES FIRST.
ALL RIGHT.
THANK YOU AND YOU WORKED HARD ON IT.
SO I GOTTA LET YOU GO!
"i'm so excited."
"You can taste the vinegar and the soy sauce."
WOW.
IT'S REALLY GOOD.
SO IF I'M CRAVING FILIPINO FOOD AND I WANT
TO GO TO LOLA'S KUSINA, HOW DO I GET A HOLD
OF SOME OF THE DIFFERENT FOOD ITEMS?
"Yum so good.
