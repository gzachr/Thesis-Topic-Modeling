this video is brought to you by Squarespace
we are in Cebu and if you watched our last
video you'll have seen that we were on a deserted
island just north of El Nido oh my God I love
this place I thought that trip was over 10
days ago so you're probably wondering what
happened between that point and now we are
definitely sad to be leaving this island so
firstly let's go over our plan after leaving
Darocotan Island we were booked onto a ferry
to take us from El Nido to an island called
Coron which is a hugely popular Island here
in the Philippines we plan to spend five days
exploring this beautiful island before jumping
on a plane from Coron to Cebu where we are
now unfortunately things didn't go exactly
as planned when we got back to El Nido this
was pretty much all that was going on
the Philippines was being affected by a tail
end of a Typhoon
which if you watched our first El Nido video
there was a rumor that one was on the way
also speaking of Typhoons there's meant to
be another one on the way so we've heard yes
we're not too sure what to do we're kind of
relaxed a little bit about it until we hear
otherwise but anime due to heavy rain and
crazy winds all the 30s the Coron were canceled
unfortunately this was the situation for four
days straight so with each day that went boy
we were losing more and more of our time in
Coron eventually two days before our flight
from Coron to Cebu we got a phone call to
say that the ferry was running at 11 A.M but
that was not the case as it was pushed back
to 6 PM so we arrived at six o'clock but the
ferry did not leave until 2 A.M meaning this
was us for eight hours straight also we got
told that the journey from El Nido to Coron
which normally takes about five hours was
now going to roughly take about nine or ten
this was down to the fact that the ferry had
been changed from a passenger ferry to a cargo
ship ferry
[Music]
[Music]
so after a very long and uncomfortable 17
hour boat Journey we finally made it to Coron
we're just enough time to sleep and to catch
our flight to sibil sadly we've seen absolutely
nothing of Coron by Coron short but very very
sweet we only got to spend just it one night
but yeah yeah that's what happens with the
fairies and the typhoons but anyway time to
move on next up next up to do on the plus
side we did make our flight to Cebu which
was on this tiny little propeller plane we
made it finally I'm not gonna lie there was
a few where prayers said on that Flight a
few and God Let's Make a Deal conversations
I think it's a Rocky Point the thing is a
tin can it just rocks like mad but thanks
I can run a tour for the worst as our four
days in Cebu looked pretty much like this
[Music]
so yes me and Samantha came down with a little
bit of a flu it was probably not surprising
considering everything that happened so yes
travel is not always easy and straightforward
here in the Philippines and today we are traveling
again we are leaving Cebu City to go to a
place called marble according to the internet
the journey takes about three hours you never
know so we're just gonna pack up our stuff
leave the hotel head to the bus terminal and
then we'll be on our way to Marble and what
a glorious day it is today honestly we're
feeling really refreshed we had plenty of
rest it was well needed after the madness
we're just heading over to 7-Eleven now we're
gonna grab a little bit of breakfast maybe
a coffee and a cake and we'll collect our
luggage and then we're going to make our way
to the bus station so we're just going to
take money out of the bike machine oh my God
[Music] that's one thing everything over in
the Philippines is cash everything is Cash
even 7-Eleven is cashed over here so all we
need to have cash on you and then there's
obviously a maximum that you can take out
of a machine on a daily so you can run out
pretty quick then as well but these are out
of order so I don't know what we're gonna
do

for sponsoring this video and continue on
to support content creators like us just to
mention on ATMs as well the one that we've
been using
there is obviously a few different ones we
just have found our card worked on this one
and uh but the only thing is the charges are
really really high and like that it only lets
us take out a certain amount daily and so
each time you go to take a transaction at
the ATM you're getting high charges on it
so I don't know if anybody knows of any other
bank machine like any foreigners that have
traveled the Philippines and you're watching
this video and one works best you can let
us know please we'd really appreciate it
thank you okay
[Music]
oh all right so we're at the post terminal
Force terminal it's called we still have to
get our ticket so we haven't booked anything
how much it costs
thank you thank you very much
it is roasting thank you hello can I get to
to model Bob okay
[Music]
do you know where we go
number six okay bracelet and when is the next
bus in 30 to 40 minutes okay number six right
thanks okay so two tickets for just over 200
pesos each which isn't too bad actually we
have to wait 30 to 40 minutes for our next
bus
Happy Days
we didn't pack any water I snapped out and
so what's this three hours so number six uh
we're hoping that we can talk I'm in here
just actually just what I would do you know
I mean it's quite a hot day thank you yeah
so yeah we're gonna see if there's a little
shop or a vending machine or something inside
so our tickets are scanned Combs I think she
said it'd be about 10 minutes so that went
way easier than I thought it would honestly
boarding oh boarding okay that was okay it
wasn't even 10 minutes
wait that was the fastest 10 minutes I don't
know why we expected to knock out the plan
I think it's just because of the last couple
of days with everything else but this was
very very easy so let's go
thank you
yeah [ __ ] anywhere is it lovely the AC
is quite nice I must say yes much needed it's
very hot today honestly self Oedipus is really
clean very comfortable we actually got to
sit together because we'd write up stories
we weren't too sure what way it worked I think
that's why we were expecting it to not go
so easy you look up things on Tick Tock um
and it's like you know her horror stories
and sometimes your weight in ages we did read
up the buses come every 20 minutes or there
could be a queue of people and you might not
get on that one uh straight away 
and then we might not get to sit together
which we can take that's all right but it's
been so easy the bus was here the girls are
10 minutes before 10 minutes and we're on
and we're sitting together and it's lovely
so everything went really sweet okay
you know what that is they're in a little
box we have no idea over there yeah as well
yeah I do not know do you know what I'm actually
really looking forward to this journey one
thing that I've began to like actually on
our travels especially over in Southeast Asia
and we have to take long distance Journey
trains courses whatever it's actually a time
to just stop Chile with listen to it with
music I really enjoy [Music] [Applause]
an angel has just appeared yes
oh my gosh lovely [Music] yes yes
okay okay thank you thank you thank you are
they cold oh they are big okay okay thank
you okay pleasure thank you oh yeah
I don't know what it is
or something yeah we don't know what they
are I'm actually all right though because
we've had the coffee already I'm like a little
zone or so we're all right and the drive isn't
too long but I opened the window it was so
funny as we're driving along people just splotchy
and they're like and they they're waving and
everything like it's gas yeah it's probably
good to know if you are getting this supposed
to eat in any snacks of water occasionally
somebody will drop on and sell some stuff
somewhere it's quite happy to know we'll give
you a little tour of our uh I see
this is basically it for a nice and tucked
in took them we've got some of our bags like
we're kind of our belong our personal items
our valuable to get to take uh with us on
the bus and then the suitcase is going on
underneath which is great so there's loads
loads of room they do actually have the overheads
as well we could have put the stuff on oh
yeah yeah the camera about big camera bike
didn't fit it never fits anywhere but I have
two bags as well but to be honest with you
they're actually just ground here because
I was planning on taking the laptop out and
do on a Bitcoin we'll see anyways but yeah
we're grounded it's cozy just plenty of real
yeah
that's another thing as well the scenery is
a little you just chill and take it all in
and look out the window because again it's
so different to where we're from and it's
just really interesting just to watch it all
[Music] right we're definitely starting to
see a different the change in the landscape
from even to good City yeah
10 season s water and then obviously some
nature and things like that so big change
from Cebu City
this has become quite um
[Music]
so we have arrived finally and it was only
three and a half hours and that was really
soft as well so I actually went really quick
and I think by this stage me and Keelan are
very used to these long journey so three and
a half hours is actually nothing and so we're
just we have our hotel in our starting up
now and we're just gonna walk to find it it's
actually handy so where we get off the bus
