 I am not a robot who just keeps on working.
I was earning 10 to 11 million won a month that time.
What do you mean we don't have money?
When I got back here, I noticed he was hiding from me.
Did he harbor any resentment towards you?
After the marriage, he started becoming cold.
Are there many Filipinas married to Koreans
who got separated?
Do you have regrets of coming here?
This is Fham, a Filipina here in Korea.
A teacher, 
band singer,
artist,
entrepreneur,
officer at a Filipino community,
single mother,
 separated.
This is her story... 
and probably the story of many Filipinas here in Korea.
Hello!
Cute!!!
She's from Russia.
Ah okay, so how do you talk to them?
I speak in English.
I teach them thematically
like this month, it's spring,
so there, we setup a garden.
Tie it up like that, okay, and twist it like this.
That's it.
I really enjoy spending time with kids
because I see my own son in them
since I was not able to watch over him.
Fham, how did you end up here in Korea?
Ahh, me? When I was in the Philippines, right after graduation, 
I finished up nursing and I passed the board exam, 
I immediately wanted to work.
But then at the hospital,
a beginner doesn't really earn much.
So for two years, I did jobs on the side
like selling computer parts.
Until one day, a childhood friend of mine
who knew some Japanese and Koreans,
offered me an English tutoring job.
So I said, why not?
So from then on, I've enjoyed it
especially since I immediately got eight students 
and the 5,000 pesos I was earning monthly 
from my nursing job
I would earn it in just a week.
Then a tutor colleague of mine
introduced a Korean guy 
who would later become my husband.
He's not my student,
but a student of my colleague's.
My colleague asked, 
"Fham, please tour him around."
So I toured him around.
Then he started calling me up.
Eventually he fell in love with me.
So you fell for each other and one night, 
it happened?
Hahaha! Which happened?
Ahh, the proposal! 
Yes, the proposal!
Yes, he actually proposed.
My parents gave us their blessing.
As soon as he returned to Korea,
he immediately sent me an invitation to come over.
He said his parents wanted to meet me.
Yeah, he invited me to come to Korea.
He returned to Korea in December, 
and I followed him in February.
I was so nervous!
I met his parents and
they immediately set up the wedding.
I was so shocked, my God!
What wedding are you talking about, I asked?
He's still a student and like in the Philippines,
how could he possibly start a family?
But we went on with the wedding after two months, April 1998.
I stayed here from then.
Did his family accept you right away?
Yes, they welcomed me.
Was there no issue that he's a Korean, you're a foreigner?
No, no, they were already open-minded then.
Because at that time, Koreans were not yet open-minded
about multi-cultural marriages.
Yes, that was also my fear, but no.  
So you got married, 
and Bitoy (the son) was born.
Actually, Bitoy was conceived quickly.
Ahh, potent!
Hahaha! Potent! Yes! 
Let's fast-forward a bit...
When did you part ways?
We separated in 2006.
On my part, I felt that
I am not a robot who just keeps on working.
I was working 15 hours then a day then.
Because he didn't have a job?
He didn't have a job.
Ahh, so he really didn't work anymore?
He had not worked for eight years.
So Fham, you separated in 2008...
did you file for divorce?
Ahmm, no, not really.
Ahh, so just a separation.
What happened was
I discovered something untoward.
I asked his parents where all our money went.
At one point, I already wanted to buy a house
because I knew we had money for deposit.
I was earning 10 to 11 million won a month then.
So I went to the Philippines
I saw this property in Sikatuna Village, Makati.
So I called him and I asked him to send the money over.
He said, 
"What money? We don't have money."
Then when I got back here,
I noticed he was hiding from me.
That's when I said no, this can't be.
I was able to figure out the online banking thing.
I saw several transactions every 5 to 10 minutes
like there's this money exchanged in gambling.
So I asked the mother, 
"Did you know about these transactions?"
So I asked her to just call a family meeting.
"We all need to talk."
He had a cousin who could speak English well.
So I explained everything.
All the relatives from the mother's side came.
I told them, "I am not happy anymore and 
I want a divorce."
"I didn't come here so I could be your...
cash cow
yes, ATM machine or something."
"I have a husband and I want to feel that."
So I was firm in breaking up.
"I really want a divorce."
My mother in law asked me not to.
She said, "I failed to raise him well."
She said I could leave the house and she'll take care of the kid
but asked me not to divorce her son.
"You can come visit but don't divorce him," she begged.
Because I didn't show them anything bad.
Did he agree to it?
Yes, it became our setup.
My son, Bitoy, was left with his mother.
I said okay because they won't let me bring Bitoy.
But my husband also ended up leaving.
So Bitoy was technically left to the care of the grandmother.
Did Bitoy not harbor any resentment towards you or the father
feeling left all alone without his parents?
When he was 13 years old, he looked for me 
and wanted to live with me.
I said yes.
So I, being the mother who had not spent much time with him,
I ended up spoiling him, giving him everything he wanted,
which was my way of compensating for the lost time together.
Did you get support from the government being a single mother?
As a single mom, I didn't get any support 
because I have a business name. 
Probably because you belong to a high economic bracket?
Probably because I was earning, yes.
Had you been legally divorced, 
you might have qualified for some support, right?
Ah yes, maybe that's why,
since we're not yet legally divorced.
Ah, yeah, probably, had you been divorced....
What's the major challenge in bringing up a kid
being a single mother (here in Korea)?
It's really difficult since my jobs
really require my time.
On the other hand, I keep worrying about him,
his food, etc.
I don't have time to cook for him,
so he got used to just ordering his food.
Plus, since he already got used to being alone,
since I am always out of the house to work,
I feel bad not being there for him,
to comfort him when he's down.
I couldn't even ask how he is.
Nothing, his companion is always his computer.
So I also couldn't blame him why his world is...
It's also my fault,
not because I intended to be always busy.
But I have no choice, I have to do this alone
since nobody is supporting me.
Let me go back to the separation, 
did you go out with other guys afterwards?
Oh, yes.
Ahh, you dated after?
Yes, yes, I dated three men afterwards.
There's a Croatian guy, a French one and a British guy.
and a Korean.
Yes, Bitoy's father.
Who was the best?
None, hahaha!
Who was the best lover?
Best lover? All of them loved me!!!
I got spoiled actually!
It's because you are worth loving.
Seriously, in fairness, I really felt loved by all of them.
Even Bitoy's father? He loved you so dearly, would you say?
Probably...yes...at the peak...during the dating period...
But Korean men have this tendency of becoming cold
after getting married.
The warmth has disappeared.
Some people may think that what they see in Korean dramas
happen in real life. No?
No, not all.
Maybe in my generation, 
the guys were not so open
in showing or expressing their emotions.
Maybe the younger generation,
they're more showy
but not during my time. 
We didn't even hold hands while walking.
And he wasn't passionate anymore?
He wasn't into that anymore...
He wasn't intimate anymore.
So, Fham, we've mentioned 
that some people think,
if you look at Instagram or Facebook,
many women dream of ending up with a Korean,
they want to meet a Korean boyfriend, 
or they want to get married with a Korean
because of the Korean drama illusion.
Ah, so they have that Korean dream, eh? 
What's your message to the women who
one, weren't so lucky with their Korean "prince charming"
and two, those who dream that it's going to be a fairytale.
Based on my experience, I guess I can I say is 
first, get to know really well  
the Korean guy you've fallen in love with or you want to marry.
It's hard that you'll come here and get married
and history repeats itself 
where broken marriages just keep getting repeated.
You really have to know the person really well.
And the communication,
he should know how to speak English.
That is really important.
And to those eyeing a Korean guy,
don't believe everything you see in the Korean dramas.
Those Filipinas who came here, for instance,
in the Philippines, we have household helper.
here, you have to scrub floors,
which is going to be a culture shock for you at first.
Household help is not common here.
In my case, that's a big culture shock.
We were not rich, but I didn't have to scrub floors
in the Philippines.
And the bowing, you have to get used to it,
because back home, 
we only bow down to gods.
Here, as soon as you arrive,
my goodness, I had to bow at once.
I really cried then.
It was a big culture shock for me.
It was a big deal for you.
Yes, it was really a big deal for me.
They just really have to learn
about the culture first, about the differences,
like their traditions, especially during family reunions,
otherwise, they'd feel out of place.
Are there many Filipinas married to Koreans
who ended up separating?
A lot.
In fact, almost everyone I know,
not only here in Geoje, but also in Ulsan.
Huh? 
There's a lot in Ulsan.
A lot? When you say "a lot," like...
As in, really a lot!
Okay....
As in, 90%.
Whaaat?!?!?
Yes!
Separated...meaning....
they have their own boyfriends and girlfriends
but they live under the same roof.
Yeah, I've heard of those stories.
They're still married, living under one roof,
but they have separate lives.
Yes!
The women have their boyfriends already and the men...
Yes, it happens, out of practicality.
If you decide to leave the house and rent out,
who's going to pay for the rent and the bills?
Then just bear the pain.
You don't want to see your husband anymore,
but just bear it since who's going to pay for...
Oh, I am shocked to hear that.
So, many Filipinas?
Yes, a lot, a lot! Many...maybe around 90%
At least within your circle, 
among the people you know.
Of course, a disclaimer,
this is not a statistic that we could verify right now.
Many of them, ahmm, 
roughly, what's the ahmmm...
What's the reason?
Yes, roughly?
The reason?
Some got married with old guys (age difference),
some Koreans are alcoholic,
while others simply are...
in the Philippines, typically,
when the husband finishes work, 
he goes home right away.
But Koreans are not like that.
They have to socialize with 1, 2, 3 stages.
Hwesik.
Yes, those hwesiks.
So these Filipinas all alone waiting at home,
getting bored,
when the husband gets home,
the husband is too tired for 
cuddling and intimacy.
So the Filipinas end up...
I also have my needs.
I need also love and care.
Let's be honest.
You're human and you have needs.
Exactly!
Last question.
Do you have regrets?
Of coming here, of ending up here,
of ending up with your Korean husband?
Did you wish you didn't come here?
No, no, no regrets.
At that time, that's the only thing I knew,
that it was the right thing to do.
There's no hindsight, 
you can't predict what's going to happen in the future.
So for me, when I decided then,
I just went with the flow.
I was very inexperienced about relationship.
That's why we couldn't avoid what happened,
our issues as husband and wife.
But I have no regrets in life.
I'm glad I'm here, in fact,
and that I have survived
all these storms in my life.
Thanks. Big thanks for this.
