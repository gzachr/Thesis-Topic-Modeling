(THE PLAY)
(Play means to play/have fun/play games)
(The Play: Time for THE BOYZ to play, eat
and have fun however they want)
Where are we?
THE BOYZ, go!
Haknyeon and boys
We arrived in the Philippines
Tada
Wow
Wow, it's colorful
It looks pretty
Where are we going to arrive?
We just arrived in the Philippines
Wow
We're here in the Philippines
Yes
Eric suddenly looks cute
(Shy)
With who do you want to
share the room?
Of course, I will...
Sunwoo
Wow
Yo, man
(Heart)
- I saw you sleeping deeply
- Pardon?
You were in deep sleep
- Me?
- Yes
True
But you didn't sleep at all
Me?
You were watching a movie
- I watched 'Incredible 2'
- That's what I'm saying
I couldn't sleep watching it
It was great
You couldn't take your eyes off it
while you were eating
I really wanted to watch it
I didn't expect that I would watch
it on the plane
Did you enjoy your meal?
I woke him up to order his meal
He just had one bite and
fell asleep again
Hahaha
As far as I remember, somebody
woke me up to order a meal
I got my meal and ate 2 bites
But I didn't have appetite so I just
had bread and fell asleep
Looks like I fell asleep
right away holding the bread
I think I had one bite
and dreamt
I'm curious whether it will
rain or not while we're here
THE BOYZ brings rain all the time
Rain welcomes us earlier than our fans
True
This time
we'll have rain or not?
I think
we won't
I'll feel said if it doesn't rain
I'd like to enjoy
to the fullest this time
I haven't been to the Philippines
Hi, the very first day in the Philippines
No, the second day?
Before we go to Show Champion
Good morning
Today is the D day
We're going to perform today
- Now
- We're here with other singers
(Coughing)
I get hoarse because it's too early
(Coughing)
I had breakfast with Eric,
it was tasty
Mango smoothie was very fresh
I liked it very much
The funny thing was
Sangyeon was sitting with
an orange colored juice
I asked,
'Is that mango juice?' and he said,
'Of course it is'
I ate mangoes a lot
Real mangoes
Real mangoes
We'll perform well today
and enjoy our time in Manila
Go!
See you later
I'll see you later
(THE BOYZ is moving to the rehearsal place)
(through a pretty street)
(heading to the stage)
Show Champion
(They're going to the waiting room)
Show Champion, go
(We'll perform well and be back)
Wow
THE BOYZ in Manila
Yeah
The place we are now is, show it
We're here to go on the big wheel
Boom
The big wheel
Wow
We're here to go on the big wheel
How do you feel?
I'm so happy
It's spinning
(They're lining up)
Four members will go on together
(New is looking at the camera)
Juyeon is making a selfie
Haha
Now it's our turn, let's go
(30 seconds before going on)
Bye
Bye
Bye
Now it's our turn
We should wait
Salamat Po
Wow
Hurry
Let's get it
I hit my head
So did I
Here
I hit here
Look, here
Bye
(Hyunjae, bye, I'll see you later)
Now, say Kimchi
Kimchi
Please take one for us
OK, 1, 2, 3
Oh? The camera is off
Sorry, not this one?
Sangyeon pushed the wrong button
OK, got it
1, 2, 3, click
Why does it show green light?
I don't know
One more
1, 2, 3, click
Good
It's awesome
We can enjoy Manila's scenery here
It's going faster than I expected
Oh, no
- Hwall is scared
- It's going higher
Oh
Don't cry
I was just kidding
I'm glad that we're having
free time like this
Yes, let's take a picture
1, 2, 3
(Click)
Good
It heals me
1, 2, 3
(Click)
Yes
Let's take the night view
'It feels like I was reborn'
'Since I met you'
Wow, now I can see the night view
(New and Hwall are humming out of joy)
Juyeon is taking photos
Selfie time
'We were together in our previous life'
It's beautiful
'Probably after life, too'
(Hwall is excited)
Is it the sea?
Yes, it is
- Really?
- Yes, it's the sea
Those white things are fishing vessels
- Where?
- You're kidding
I'm serious
- True
- They look like streetlamps
- No, they're vessels
- Yes
- Wow, it's so beautiful
- What are they doing?
They're fishing
How do you know?
- I know, I called them
- How?
- Seriously?
- Haha
I called them and asked
Hehe
He called them
Juyeon,
did you feel the same when
you were bungee jumping?
Now I'm on the top and it's nothing
There is nothing
I can't see anything
I'm not scared, but
there is no safety device
Oh
We're on the top
We're higher than that
Wow, we really are
Can I take a photo down there?
How did you like the performance today?
I had fun
I liked today's performance
This reminds me of the movie,
'Before Sunrise'
Has anybody watched the movie?
What's that?
There is a famous line from the movie
The male main character and
the female character kiss here
What do you mean?
You're going to kiss New?
Juyeon and New?
What? Kiss?
Yes
Show us
We're on the top now
We're on the top
- We're on the top
- We're going down
(Manila's night view is seen)
We're going down
'Since I met you'
'You comforted my shabby heart'
'Since I recognized you, lalalala'
Wow, it looks nice
I really like to ride that one,
there's even a biking ride
Me, either
There are not that many people here
It would be nice if there was
a big wheel in Seoul
No big wheel in Seoul?
There's one in Children's Grand Park
One?
But it's small
There is no big wheel
with a great Han River view
It'll be prosperous if there is one
It's already finished
We got on around 10 minutes ago
It hasn't been even 10 minutes
since we got on the big wheel
'There are many friends,
scattering cherry blossom petals'
It's good
(Sudden Busker Busker)
'The scattering cherry blossom petals'
'Spread out on this street'
'As we walk together'
'As the spring wind blows'
'The scattering cherry blossom petals'
People look happy
'Don't be happy'
They recognize us
We just landed
It will be a wonderful memory
Let's go
Wow
After the performance, where are we now?
Amusement park!
What's this next to us?
It's a big wheel
Yes, we're next to a big wheel
I don't know how it'll take,
but let's try
Let's enjoy it together
Yes, let's go
It's been a while
Really?
I was very young when
I got on the big wheel
When I was in Kindergarten
I haven't got on the big wheel since then
Really?
It's going up, right?
On the top I feel scared,
but the view is awesome
Oh, really?
Cut it out
When was your last time, Kevin?
I think I did in Vancouver
Oh, are you ready?
Let's talk later
OK
It'll be fun
I had an K-POP audition in Seattle
There's also a famous
big wheel in Seattle
I strongly recommend it
Strongly recommend
Eric, have you got on the big wheel?
It'll take long, I guess
Around 10 to 15 minutes?
What if it takes 30 minutes?
Wow, it's huge
Wow, now it's our turn
Oh, should we catch next one?
It's been a while
Wow
It feels like I'm in ski resort
It's huge
The door is open
Let's go
Wow
It's cold in here
It's colder than I expected
We're going up
Wow
I've overcome my fear of heights
Hahaha
Heights?
He's overcome it
I have
This height is nothing
Please say to the camera
It's nothing
When I reached the top, it was
a little faster than this
Not a little
It was at the speed of light
Wow, what's that?
I didn't know
It's biking ride
I meant, something spinning
What's that? I haven't seen it
Can you see that?
- I can't ride something like that
- I can't
- Something like that
- I have motion sickness
I can't see anything
I'm scared
Can you see that?
This is scarier than bungee jumping
This one
When I was very young
me, my sister and mom
went to an amusement park
and rode a big wheel
When we were almost on the top,
the big wheel broke down
Oh, you must have been scared
It sounds scary
My mom brought Tteokbokki,
Kimchi and rice for lunch
Into the big wheel?
Yes, into the big wheel
We got hungry while
we were stuck there
So we ate lunch there
We did
It's an old memory
Yes, it is
Since then I hadn't got on a big wheel
It's been a while
I'm scared
How did you do bungee jumping?
You should jump from something like here
Most importantly, you should not look down
I'm scared, what if this stops suddenly?
We're now in the Philippines,
how do you feel?
It's wonderful
Who has been here before?
I guess this is the first
time for everybody
For me, too
Really?
Wow, it's so beautiful
Manila Bay is very famous
The sea
Let me show you
I can't see
Do you see the sea?
Look, there is the sea
We're on the top
We've reached the top
Have we?
Make a wish now
You should make a wish now
THE BOYZ, good luck
2019 will be more successful than 2018
A lot more!
THE BOYZ, let's get a prize
for the best rookie
Go, THE BOYZ
Go!
THE BOYZ, let's stay healthy
Oh, I'm scared
Let's say 'Go' together
We just passed the top
Go, hurry
OK
1, 2, 3, go!
OK
I've dived off a 15m place
15m?
It's higher than it seems
I guess it is
I'd like to try that bungee jumping
Ah, that's right
Our Philippines fans welcomed us
more than we expected
- Yes
- Thank you
Thank you so much, it was awesome
They're not THE B,
but interested in K pop
Thanks to their cheering,
we performed well
Even the staff
on the stage on the street
They cheered us before
we went up to the stage
Thanks to them we performed well
The people of the Philippines
are very energetic
There are still many people
even though it's late
It's almost 11 pm
They're very energetic
Let's check the time
We've almost landed
Let me check the time
We should be careful,
it won't stop
It's been 7 minutes
Really?
It's faster than I expected
It's fun
If you miss the chance to get out,
you should go up again
Shall I keep sitting?
Don't open the door
Take a photo for me
It's been 7 minutes and 30 seconds
Add 1 more minute
We've almost landed
Look, there are fans outside
Let's get off
Let's get off
Thank you
Thank you
We just got off
We should go now
Bye
Bye
Eric, by
Hyunjae, bye
I'll turn the camera off, bye
