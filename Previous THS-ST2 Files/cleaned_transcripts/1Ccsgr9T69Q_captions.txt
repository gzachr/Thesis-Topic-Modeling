land domestic air and domestic sea travel to and 
from Metro Manila shall be suspended beginning  
March 15 2020. well everything has just changed 
it's complete lockdown and there are now sirens  
go home everybody Welcome to our new home 
here in the Philippines for the next well  
I guess for the unforeseeable future we 
don't know how long we're going to be here
well I can't believe it I honestly can't believe 
that we are back here in the Philippines for the  
first time in a long time three years to be exact 
it's almost three years to the day that we've very  
for the first time we flew to the Philippines 
March 2020. the rest I think if you're watching  
this you probably know that we got stuck here 
for over four months at the beginning of the  
pandemic we're finally back I know we're back on 
our own terms this time and we can finally get to  
see a little bit more of the country because last 
time when we got stuck we didn't get to see very  
much did we really didn't we had all these major 
plans all the stuff we wanted to see and it well  
obviously didn't happen I had to see a little bit 
of stuff but this time we've got plans we're in  
Cebu to be specific we're gonna hang around 
here for about a month and like visit some  
islands yeah we got some big plans you guys and 
I don't know if you can tell we're extra excited  
it's honestly really really difficult to put 
into words what it feels like to be back there's  
a whole range of emotions coming back here 
leaving here the last time being stuck here  
during a pandemic obviously really big highs and 
really big lows so it brings back a little bit  
of that in both good ways and bad ways but in 
general we are so beyond excited to be back I  
never really thought this day well I knew it 
was gonna get here but it never felt like it  
was really ever gonna get here but oh yeah we're 
here we're in Cebu by the way if you are watching  
this right now please hit that like button for one 
thing I bet you a lot of people watch this during  
the pandemic and then as we started traveling 
again probably just kind of trailed off maybe  
forgot about us and if you like this maybe it'll 
push it out to some of those people that kind of  
forgot about us but we're really excited we're 
back here the other thing you'll want to do is  
follow us on Instagram because we do Post stories 
in real time like in the moment you guys know that  
YouTube's always a little bit behind you might be 
wondering when Anna's looking back there we're at  
a park here in Cebu called Plaza independencia I 
just love how green this place is there's not too  
many green spaces at least that we know of in the 
city here in Cebu if there are just let us know in  
the comments you guys but one thing we wanted to 
mention really quick is the Filipino people just  
how nice to Filipino People Are we almost forgot 
the minute we got here everyone was trying to  
help us right away welcome to Philippines welcome 
to Philippines people were so happy and I don't  
want to say we forgot that when we did get stuck 
here during the pandemic we remember but boy the  
minute we get back here it's just different you 
guys Filipinos are some of the nicest people in  
the entire world we honestly feel a connection 
to this country probably on like anywhere else  
in the world for I would think obvious reasons we 
got stuck here for such a long time during such a  
well I guess a traumatic time for everybody in the 
world and it created this connection with people  
that are here with people that watched us so many 
Filipino people we had Filipino people reaching  
out to us all the time they were watching us they 
were in the town that we were in and they were  
really trying to help us out they even helped us 
get out of the country in the end so we have this  
like very emotional connection to this country 
we love it so much and again I'm gonna gush a  
lot during this video but I'm just so excited to 
be back I also I feel like getting stuck here also  
changed the way that we film and the way that our 
videos are is it's changed the way our YouTube  
channel in the direction and everything like that 
basically we created more of a connection with you  
guys I think a lot of people that are watching 
us now not not just Filipinos but around the  
world started watching us during that time and 
you really got to know us that way I think we  
filmed differently because of that before we get 
any farther in the video we want to say a huge  
thank you to our favorite plastic free deodorant 
native who are back again to sponsor another video  
as you guys probably already know I switched over 
to Native plastic free deodorant quite a while ago  
now and it's definitely a decision I do not regret 
I absolutely love this product and that's because  
this deodorant packaging is Earth friendly and 100 
plastic free it's made of recyclable packaging and  
you save 37 grams of single-use plastic when 
you purchase native's plastic free deodorant  
instead of the classic packaging in fact native 
uses the same formula as their regular deodorant  
but with more sustainable packaging but the other 
question is does it actually smell good and the  
answer is an absolute yes their wide range 
of scents might be my favorite thing about  
they just launched their Candy Shop collection 
which will let you satisfy your sweet tooth with  
some of your favorites like gummy bears and 
sweet cinnamon Hearts right now I have aloe  
and green tea eucalyptus and mint and coconut and 
vanilla which just might be the best thing I've  
ever smelled amazing plastic free packaging and 
great scents but native also protects from odor  
all day with 72 hour protection and it's aluminum 
free and paraben free vegan and cruelty free use  
our link and code delightful four to get 20 off 
your very first purchase at Native this offer is  
available site-wide but only for a limited time 
so stock up and save also a huge thank you to  
Native for sponsoring this video and supporting 
creators like us now let's go see more of Cebu  
so right next to the plaza is this Ford it's 
called Fort San Pedro and you can see well  
it's pretty stunning and very very old I'm inside 
here now you can see the walls behind me now we  
said earlier that we're in Cebu but I might want 
to elaborate that on that a little bit we're in  
Cebu City at the moment so don't worry we will be 
going to some islands and finding those beautiful  
Filipino beaches at some point but for now we're 
in the city it's actually one of the bigger cities  
in the Philippines and we're really excited to 
be here funny this actually reminds me a little  
bit of a place in Manila that we visited 
before the epidemic right before the chaos  
started because the older area of Manila called 
intramuros intramurals intramuros okay and it's  
it has a fourth that looks very very similar 
to this of course they were both built by the  
Spanish so I'm sure that's why I did get a little 
bit of fat couple of facts for you they come from  
the internet not from me I'm not a historian 
so if anything's inaccurate not my fault it's  
Google's fault today's structure dates back from 
1738 obviously built by the Spanish as I just said  
it is the oldest triangular Bastion fort in the 
country whatever that means it's served as the  
nucleus that's a funny word someone I guess 
trying to be really inventive when they uh I  
like it I like that word the nucleus of the first 
span of settlement in the entire Philippines and  
during the Philippine Revolution at the end of 
the 19th century it was attacked and taken over  
by the Filipino revolutionaries and they used 
it as a stronghold so tons of History here it  
must have been quite interesting that's about as 
much history as you're going to get today after  
all we're not historians but we can say this 
place is beyond impressive it feels incredibly  
old and there's just something about this Spanish 
style right every time see it it makes you feel  
like you're kind of in Europe or like even in 
South America they have a lot of buildings like  
Spanish Colonial basically it's really interesting 
yeah we love it it's funny because you guys used  
to ask us all the time like when are we coming 
back to the Philippines when are we coming all  
the time and then what happened well we always 
plan to for the record but last year we came  
over to Southeast Asia and we went to Vietnam 
and we got invited there so we didn't have any  
time to kind of go anywhere else it was a bit of 
a bummer because we wanted to know and we got so  
many messages we got to Vietnam being like how are 
you coming to the Philippines and everyone was so  
excited and we couldn't get there because we just 
didn't have enough time and then a few months ago  
we came over to Associates Asia again and we've 
been in mainly in Thailand and Vietnam again so  
I feel like some of you guys maybe gave up hope 
that we were coming but we're here and I hope  
you're really really excited I think you can tell 
that we're very excited before we arrived in Cebu  
City a lot of people told us don't come to this 
place yes they actually told us you don't need to  
come to this city just skip it so we thought about 
it for a moment and we said nah we have to check  
it out we usually go against the grain on this 
channel we had to see what Cebu City is all about  
now the place we're standing in is absolutely 
beautiful this fort is out of this world but I  
will say the area that surrounds it is a little 
older and dare I say maybe a little bit run down  
now we're staying in an entirely different part 
of this city we can't wait to show you because I  
don't think you're going to expect to see what 
you're about to see we're taking you there now  
welcome to Ayala Center believe it or not we are 
actually at a mall right now this is a newer part  
of the city and we found this also in Manila when 
we were there last time was that they yeah they  
make really great malls they do in Thailand 
too but they do outdoor spaces in their malls  
like we're basically like in a mall in a garden 
like in a park I'm gonna show you stand there  
everywhere I turn all these places behind Anna 
are like restaurants and there's multiple levels  
of them it's so nice because malls themselves you 
can kind of get like trapped inside them you guys  
know what I mean sometimes they're like six seven 
eight different floors and you always feel like  
you're inside and you don't really get get outside 
or even know what's happening outside you don't  
know what time of day it is but here they have 
a whole area that's outside I think it's safe  
to say the Philippines knows how to do malls it's 
pretty cool they even have like outdoor escalators  
here so we're making our way uh upstairs now at 
this mall we're not going inside the mall today  
though we just dropping stay here but we're trying 
to find a certain drink we kind of missed it we  
haven't had this particular drink in a while all 
right here it is look at the color of this juice  
boy do we miss this little guy now what is it it's 
called calamansi juice of course Filipinos know  
that that are watching but this is one of our 
favorite juices we've ever tried it's so good  
and I don't think maybe you can correct me if I'm 
wrong that you can really get it outside of the  
Philippines we did actually find Frozen calamansi 
at home in Halifax where we were desperate looking  
for it but it's not the same when it's frozen here 
you get it fresh so if you're wondering calamansi  
is like a small little citrus fruit kind of like 
a lime sort of similar to that but a little maybe  
Sweeter than Wine yeah the price wasn't too bad 
uh either think of it like a very fancy lemonade  
like a better better lemonade believe it or not so 
now that we get to hydrate a little bit because it  
is 30 degrees Celsius here guys it's hot every 
day surprise surprise let's talk about what our  
itinerary is here in the Philippines where we're 
going to stick to but first let's let's touch on  
where we're not going well first I want to say I 
bet you a lot of you guys have probably already  
left I'm saying I hope you're going here I 
hope you're doing this you should do this  
I kind of sort of have a little bit of a plan open 
to a little bit of changes so we will ask for your  
recommendations but we're not going back to El 
Nido now I know some of you will be disappointed  
but we figured we spent so much time in Palawan 
in El Nido that this time around we really wanted  
to see more of the Philippines because let's 
face it we didn't get to see much that was the  
thing and we did debate a lot going back to 
El Nido we want to go there we will again go  
back in the future but for now we really wanted to 
concentrate on going to places that we missed out  
um last time yeah one place we did want to go to 
that we're not going to get to this time that I  
promise we will in the future is boracai reason 
being is that we are going to be jumping around a  
lot in the next few months and we knew if we were 
taking a lot of planes here in the Philippines we  
were just going to burn ourselves we don't want to 
burn ourselves out we know that Sharko exists we  
know that Manila is awesome but we're not going 
to any of those places we've been there before  
here's what we need help with we're sticking to 
Cebu and we're not taking a plane we're okay to  
get ferries but we're gonna try to stick around 
this island and maybe neighboring Island so if you  
guys guys have any recommendations please fire 
away and let us know what you'd like to see us  
do but more specifically maybe around beaches 
huh beaches yeah specifically because we're  
obviously going to get our city time in here in 
Cebu City so if you have any recommendations like  
your favorite absolutely gorgeous Beach that's 
in varying or driving distance from Cebu City  
let us know yeah we can't wait to get to those 
beaches we will there'll probably be one or two  
Vlogs from the city here because we're stoked 
to be in the city but then we'll be moving on  
and getting out of the city into some of that 
beautiful landscapes the Philippines is known  
for it's funny we were just talking and we were 
saying that this part of Cebu City reminds us a  
little bit of Manila that's the first thing we 
said but more particularly Makati Makati there  
was a mall and I totally forgot that I'm actually 
meant to look it up before we filmed this that we  
filmed at last time and it had like a very outdoor 
Vibe like this but you guys maybe will know what  
I'm talking about yeah the makati's really cool 
but look at this behind us we're still like in  
the small complex and it's like a big old Green 
Space there's like a playground over there just  
a bunch of people hanging out it's super super 
cool so much you can do at the malls here those  
guys are having fun so to be honest we didn't 
really get off to the best start here in City  
we've been here a few days now and we just started 
filming but at the very beginning part of it was  
kind of our fault we didn't do enough research 
and we stayed in the wrong area so if you are  
coming to stay here I would suggest staying around 
this area we've also heard that uh Cebu it Park  
which I think we might visit in the next video is 
supposed to be really really cool but we were in  
I think it was called Capital City it just wasn't 
the right area for us it's one of the older parts  
of the city we had to take caps to get anywhere 
and sometimes we couldn't get cabs and it just  
seemed like everything we tried to do it wouldn't 
work out we go somewhere we didn't have cash and  
they cash only or like we tried to get grab and it 
didn't work or like our food delivery didn't come  
it's just a one thing after the other just kind 
of didn't line up the moment we moved over here we  
been enjoying it a lot more and there's things to 
be seems to be working out better now you might be  
wondering how many videos will we have here from 
the Philippines we think between six and ten we're  
not making any promises yet we have uh 30 days 
we don't want to burn ourselves out but we're  
excited to film more here now while we're walking 
around this mall we said we want to get ourselves  
another drink seems weird for us being from Canada 
getting a drink at a mall when I say drink like an  
alcoholic drink is is kind of weird for us but 
we're gonna look to see if we can find something  
specific well we found a cool spot called the 
social and it's this outdoor space still in  
the mall and you can see kind of the city in the 
background is super cool we did get a beer and  
it's not just any beer we got a San Miguel light 
there's a lime in there I promise we used to have  
these when we were in the Philippines three years 
ago so we don't come across San Miguel's too often  
so we're excited that they're back in our lives so 
right now we just had to chill out and have a beer  
and also we're trying to plan we mentioned already 
we're trying to figure out where we're going to go  
around Cebu and some of the neighboring islands 
and well we thought we'd do it over an alcoholic  
beverage in this case the San Miguel light 
because we're in the Philippines you just don't  
malls like this in Canada I can't imagine 
sitting outside at a mall and if you were  
maybe you'd be looking at like a car park or a 
parking lot or something like that it wouldn't  
have a beautiful view of the city there's loads 
of restaurants here as well and all sorts of  
different types of foods which of course is not 
a Filipino restaurant but we're going to be here  
for approximately a month of course we're going 
to try lots more Filipino food we did the last  
time around but it was a little bit more limited 
because you know we were locked down basically  
in one hotel for almost the entire time so our 
choices were a little bit limited so we want  
you guys to leave us some recommendations 
what should we try while we're here we  
have some famous or really good your favorite 
Filipino dishes please don't recommend that
I do want to say really quick we did get to try a 
night market in Manila right before the lockdown  
so we have tried some Filipino food but it's been 
a while you guys and we're trying to figure out  
I think that night Mark was also a mix of like 
Filipino food and some like International it was  
I know there's we had some favorites in the past 
with some breakfast dishes and one I know for sure  
we got to try at some point is chicken adobo 
adobo pancit sisig all these things coming to  
mind and by the way if you're watching and you're 
new around here we do have a Philippines playlist  
that you can go back and watch when we were kind 
of stuck here and there's some other random uh  
videos so if you want to see us in the Philippines 
in the past but we're just excited we're super  
excited to be back here I think you guys can all 
tell that such a great day here in Cebu we're so  
excited to be back as you can tell I know we 
mentioned yeah have we said that a few times  
but we're really really excited we just wanted 
to turn the camera on today and just take you  
guys with us see what we can find nothing 
super planned yeah so but in the next video  
we're going to try to explore a little bit more 
of this city see if we can find some other cool  
interesting areas of the city and then after that 
we do actually have one Island Cebu Island book  
yeah and maybe tell them what that is maybe 
in the next video uh because we will still  
be in the city we believe and we will tell you 
where we are going if not you're just gonna see  
where we're going yeah but we did assign you 
guys let's say we assigned you guys a lot of  
homework because we want this series to involve
