hey driving up tricycle
Anything is Possible
hello everyone uh we're in Manila yes in Manila 
underneath the bridge in the middle of the  
traffic in the middle of the intersection 
as you can see Manila is a pretty crowded  
Sydney there's a lot of cars and a lot of 
people so to get from point A to point B  
we can use public transportation like Tiffany's 
taxis bikes tricycle tripeeds Motorcycles Cars
know and the Metro which is running above you yes 
so today it's all about public transportation and  
it's all about going from point A to point 
B in a busy rush hour traffic let's go  
so Michael what are we waiting for we are 
waiting for the bus with the one cup of  
coffee and in the middle of the rain because 
the bus is not coming it's kind of calm but  
we have two ways maybe until the rain is 
gonna go I don't know hopefully let's see
one hour later the rain has stopped 
we're still here waiting for the bus
we ask the people here if the bus number 13 
is coming so this is how what it says on on  
Google right but and the people said like 
don't worry the bus is coming like today  
tomorrow one of these days the bus 
is Gonna Come so we're waiting here  
let's see I'm very excited hey we made it to the 
bus this one is another boss yes this time because  
the bus that we were waiting for was not available 
so we had to go all the way by Japanese to come to  
this box yeah and now with this bus we can finally 
go to BGC and this one is called the carousel boss  
everybody is using it because it's like the skip 
line right you just travel through the city you  
come from point to point with this one yes 83 
basically you just hop on and you hop off whenever  
you're finished it has its own dedicated Lane on 
the street and it can go very fast from point A to  
point B that's why this is the preferred method of 
transportation and it's more or less like a normal  
regular bus except the fact that it's fast so in 
three it has a fast lane wow this is so good and  
now we're in a different bus because bus number 
two takes us to BGC to Market Market because the  
other one the carousel bus stops here in this bus 
station and we have to switch they can take it get  
this one and then continue our destination and 
so far we have to take another bus to go to BGC  
interesting I don't understand anything anymore 
but it is always popping on buses and off buses  
it's actually easy here once you know where you 
have to go exactly and once you know where you
most important thing you have to know where 
you take the bus from and where you have to  
go and then everything is good true officially 
I don't understand the Metro anymore we were  
on the other side we said we wanted to go 
to EDSA and it had come here on this side  
and now when we come on this side they 
say no no go back from the other side
why is it so hard to take the metro 
here freaking incredible man oh my God
okay now he says it's okay first time in 
the larti in Manila Philippines first time  
we got the chance to take it actually 
unlike last time when we it was closed  
because of the Thai food so it's pretty 
nice and modern and everyone jumps into  
go to their work or come back from their work 
with Baylor the cost was I think 25 percent 20  
pesos per person and you get the card like this 
for a single ride this is what me and Michael  
got you just scan this go past the electric gates 
and then you jump inside the Metro and you stop  
with the designated stop because if you want to 
go further than that you won't be able to exit  
with this card because you just paid until certain 
station like in most Asian countries we've been so  
far apparently the Metro is above not underground 
same way Malaysia seems like a Singapore same like  
in India so I mean that's why it's called lot 
I guess not both Metro anymore or underground  
or Subway it's cold energy but we're still inside 
Metro Manila okay because it's a metropolitan area
okay and now another form of transportation 
around Manila is this kind of bike which is  
by the way my favorite one because it's the 
fastest one and the most fun one it's the first  
time we're riding in such a vehicle I don't know 
how they're called drive cycles tricycle tripod
like it means
it means and nothing in here in the front
and
outside
and the fun part is that the side car is so 
low we are very close to the ground and you  
can almost feel your ass scraping the ground as 
you're going forward but it's pretty fun I mean
effective yes most efficient and most effective 
Transportation methods around here the only thing  
is that this uh sidecar is a bit crumby we don't 
fit both of us inside we're like uh but who is it  
I mean for the quick ride around town perfect 
this small sidecars they kind of remind me of  
the rickshaws in Pakistan in India but somehow 
in the way they are way more fun because they're  
so cramped and you can actually get closer to 
your partner while you're driving inside one  
of these things why did he definitely top 
station methods ever in the world for me  
I never thought I would ride with DG in 
a sidecar with a motorcycle in Manila
yes if it's raining then it's way more 
fun as you saw in the previous video  
price for this video you go huggleable so you 
have to angle with the people when you're talking  
to them when you're asking them where to go 
and this is how you fix your price and then  
you get in and you go get that and if for some 
reason they don't want to date you very much
then have no fear because the city 
is literally filled with this kind  
of eagles so the choice is yours 
you can choose anyone anyone as  
long as there is one on the street 
they will stop for you and you can
hi hello hello thank you thank you thank you 
so much another public transportation option is  
actually a jiffy please as you guys saw the first 
time we arrived here in Manila Pikachu either way  
we had no idea what we were and where we were 
supposed to go and how was like traveling with  
a jeepney this is the second time we're doing this 
and we're leaving the mall of Asia in order to go  
back home and you have to know which MRT or LRT 
station to stop at because the drivers all of  
them have different routes but some of the routes 
might actually stop at your station so you have to  
go and ask around like for example we're staying 
at durotia hotel and for us there are three lines  
that go there as like as we understood on the 
little sign board signs there for example Jose  
there are three directions you can go to Lumen 
fit Santa Cruz and MCU but if you don't know  
your way around it like uh we didn't the locals 
here will help you and will tell you what kind  
of way is better for you and just speak with the 
driver and tell him the station wants to go open  
this is pretty interesting okay this is the 
first country where we saw the chimney being  
such a popular um transportation public 
transportation method the they give me is  
faster and it's more convenient because you 
go inside and then how much is the ticket
so I'm doing now for my ticket which is 20 
Christmas prescription it's also convenient  
like yes it's also the same price as the 
MRT so faster how old is one of these cars
20 40 years old wow but it's made of 
steel it's like the material is iron Steel  
that's why 40 more years no problem
oh you can travel with the jeepney for 100 
years they won't break that's really cool okay  
and at the end of the day we take a ride in this 
e-tricycle which is kind of like a bike but it's  
electric and just stop them on the side of the 
road Jay picked us and he helped us well we were  
searching for a jeepney to go back home and he was 
like oh come on with us it's just 20 professors  
for one person all the way to your destination so 
very nice people and he warned us about like being  
careful while choosing the transportation 
method so really nice really nice day
