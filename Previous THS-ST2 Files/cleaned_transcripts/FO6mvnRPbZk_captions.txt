- [Both] What's up agaw!
- Welcome back to our YouTube channel.
- This is your
- Agaw Jake & Joemar TV.
- Okay, let me get that again.
Nervous, nervous, okay. (laughs)
- [Woman] (speaks foreign language)
(all laughing)
- So, I'm excited about today.
We're taking a quick
pit stop at Delish Deli
before headed out to Carcar.
It's gonna take about an hour
and a half to three hours,
depending on traffic, to get there.
We're meeting with some twins
that we're gonna be sharing
a special surprise with.
If you didn't catch out the last episode
where we showed what we got them,
check that out and come
along for the ride.
(bright upbeat music)
- [Crew] (Welcome to Teology!)
- So, we're here at Teology,
on the way to Carcar.
It's a new spot, they just
opened at last Saturday,
so good luck to these guys.
Always great to see a new business started
during the pandemic.
I like the business here, so.
Yeah, this is my channel.
It's John Smulo.
- Okay, John Smulo.
- Yeah.
- I will add you sir, I will
definitely like and subscribe.
- Thank you so much.
I really appreciate your support.
(bright upbeat music continues)
So, it was great meeting
Joseph, here today,
we just randomly stopped by this place
and it's always a pleasure to
meet employees at businesses
that just go out of their way
to make you feel at home, so.
I'm sure the owners here are very happy
to have an employee like you,
making guests feel welcomed.
Thanks a lot, I appreciate it.
Okay.
Take care.
- Take care.
- Thank you guys.
(upbeat music continues)
Thank you, miss.
Okay, salamat.
So, we're here in Carcar,
which is famous for lechon but,
I just bought some rice krispies.
I'm told they're very good here as well.
So, we'll check those out a bit later.
(bright upbeat music continues)
So, we just went to Jollibee
to get food for the family.
We're in Carcar, which is
pretty famous for lechon here.
But we figured that
since they're around lechon every day,
that they would probably want
Jollibee for a change, so.
It started raining.
Hopefully, it'll clear
up before we get there.
(bright upbeat music continues)
So, we're headed off to finally
get to see the twins now.
Beautiful place out here.
So, we finally made it to Carcar.
It's such a beautiful area out here
and glad to meet some new friends.
Can you guys introduce yourself?
- Hi, I'm Glori.

- [Female Voice] Jake,
Joemar and this is Sir John
- [John Smulo] Hi, nice to meet you.
- Hi guys! What's going on, ahhhhhh
(laughs)
(upbeat music plays)
- I'm really excited to be
here with Jake and Joemar.
They are very talented guys at beatboxing.
It's wonderful to be able
to be out here in Carcar
where they are and spending
some time with their family.
Both of them got to be known
first in the Philippines
because they're so
talented with beatboxing.
And then when celebrities like
Will Smith and Raffy Tulfo
were here in the Philippines
and others, covered them.
So guys, thank you so much
for having us here with you.
Can you tell me more about yourself?
- My name is Joemar
- And my name is Jake
- And it looks like you
come from a very big family.
How many of them are there?
(speaks foreign language)
- It's only the two of them.
- Oh, okay, okay. And
living here with a lot of
other people as well, it seems like.
So tell me how old are you both
and what grade are you in in school?
- 16 years old and
(speaks foreign language).
- Okay. Very good.
And so you're really well
known for beatboxing.
How did you get started with that?
- Five years old.
- Five years old?
- So he started beatboxing
at five years old.
- What was your inspiration to start?
(speaks foreign language)
- Well they started listening
to radio and disco music.
That's how they started the beatboxing.
- Great. Very good.
So your style of beatboxing is very unique
from anything I've ever heard.
How did you develop your own style?
(speaks foreign language)
- So he said that the hand
makes a very different
and loud sound. Yeah.
- Very good.
So before you started beatboxing
and becoming really well known by others
did you ever expect
that there would be
celebrities like Will Smith
or Project Nightfall or Raffy
Tulfo that would discover you?
(speaks foreign language)
(speaks foreign language)
- So they said that they're very happy
that they were discovered by these people,
by Will Smith and all.
And they're glad
that they're showing the whole
world about their talent.
- Awesome. So when you get older
what would you like to see
yourselves doing in the future?
(speaks foreign language)
(speaks foreign language)
- (foreign language) drummers, mixers
- So they're saying that they're dream
is to have their own studio
and finish their studies
and him, he wants to be a
drummer and a mixer of music.
- Very good.
Very good.
So if there's others out there looking to
support these guys in their future,
it's really exciting to see young people
here in the Philippines.
Really, if you see where we
are, it's a beautiful area,
kind of out a little bit
in the middle of nowhere
but I love that, people,
no matter where they are
in the world, could have amazing
talents and be discovered
and really follow their
dreams and passions.
So one of the things that I mentioned
to you guys earlier when we talked
is that I'm not only impressed
by how amazing you guys are at beatboxing.
And I really got to say guys
that listening to them on
video, I was already amazed
with there be boxing skills
but they were just beatboxing
a little bit a while ago
and I was like, wow,
they are really amazing in person as well.
But in addition to being so impressed
by both of these guys, with
their skills, with beatboxing
the other thing that
really touched my heart
and really stood out to
them is that when they
first started making money on
YouTube, they didn't go out
like, I think a lot of kids
in the U.S. or other parts
of the world would do
and just spend it on cool
stuff for themselves.
Instead, can you guys tell me what you did
with your initial earnings on YouTube?
(speaks foreign language)
- So the first thing they
did when they got their
salary is to help their relatives.
They helped them build their own house
because they think that
they really need to help.
So when they got their
first YouTube salary
they took the initiative to help them
because they had enough money for them.
Instead of buying anything they want,
they chose to help
their relatives in need.
- Yeah. That's, that's really wonderful.
That's great.
So if you guys could get
something for yourself
that you really want
what would be something
that you might get?
(speaking foreign language)
- They said that they wanted to get
get bicycles for themselves
because (speaking foreign language)
because they are very into biking.
- Wow. That's, that's great.
Well, that's interesting.
I didn't see many bikes
around here, but I wonder
if we snap our fingers a little bit later
if we might find something
like that, hiding
behind a tree somewhere.
So guys, I want to thank you
so much for spending time
with us today.
And before we go,
if you guys could walk us out to our car
we have something that might
be hiding out there for you.
(rooster crows)
Does that sound okay?
(laughs)
(everyone talking)
(string music plays)
- Let's go!
- I'm excited!
- Excited now!
(inspirational music plays)
- [Joemar] I'm excited Jake

and get the boys the first bike.

- But, wait a second
Daniela, if you could ask
them they're twins, right?
- Right.
- [John Smulo] Oh, so that means
maybe they need doha?
Ah, okay. Hold on, hold on.
(crowd cheers)
(speaks foreign language)
- That's mine! This is mine Jake!

(speaks foreign language)
(hardcore music plays)
(guitar riff solo)
- Ohhh, hello guys!
This bike is like a motorcycle.
(speaks foreign language)
- So it was a great day
traveling here to Carcar,
meeting Jake and Joemar and his family.
They're a lot of fun, super talented
and especially loved just
how generous they are
with their family, thinking first
of them and not of themselves.
So it especially made it
a pleasure to be able to
give them a gift today.
So as always, thank you
for taking the time to
watch and take care.
Thanks guys.
