Yo good morning to you all
I'm now with Ally Dala
Good morning bro
We went to Mcdonald's
So yesterday,
I started at 6PM editing my vlogs in my computer
and I finished at 12AM
and then it crashed.
and then it didn't save
it's frustrating
so you should save (the vlog) first ok?
Lesson learned
So our idea for today is...
we're going to ask...
We're going to ask Japanese if they would date a Filipino?
would you date a FilipinoÂ woman?
No.
We don't have 5th and 6th period
so we're going to gymnasium
to play basketball
right?
so we just finished playing basketball
As you can see I am so red
we're just going to take a rest for a while
and then we go home
