am very happy and very excited to be back here

money do I have to spend here on a typical day

of my favorite of transportations here in the  
Philippines and I think we're on the wrong side 
of the road ah he's going over there now yeah  
all right so back on the right side okay so 
yeah I took these vehicles before when I was  
here last year and they are quick and easy it's a 
fun way to get around the city you can literally  
find them everywhere and it's just the motorbike 
and then they have the little attachment here oh
oh this is not very happy to be back in 
Manila oh I missed the Vibes here oh oh  
so many things that remind me about my 
last time here last year H oh the best  
chicken in the Philippines yes so in theory 
you can even fish two people in here but if  
you are a tall person that it might yeah 
doesn't fit but usually you can also Place  
one here excuse me how many people can 
you take here five people five people oh  
not sure how five people are going to fit in 
here maybe two here one here two in the back
standing almost hitting my head need 
to be careful here wow yeah I think  
this is a oldy k wow I love The Vibes 
here in Manila there's so much action  
going on on the streets a a little bit 
of chaos but in a positive way you know  
I love that so much energy here oh the noisy 
motorbike the noisy roads oh I missed that
somehow okay we have a little bit of jam 
here now you see I'm cing the road this one  
is actually parking here maybe this is like a JY 
bus station here because we have several of them
here oh and there's one jimney with a 
problem looks like he's changing the
tires all right I think we have almost arrived I  
remember this church here and there's a 
big mark get around the church you can  
stop somewhere here yeah that's okay 
that's fine there then I will take the
bridge all right that was a fun
r that was fun thank you very much Sal much it's 
okay get the change okay have a good day bye-bye  
yeah I know that was a tourist price but hey we 
have Christmas season I don't want to negotiate  
too much seem to be a fun guy and yeah let's 
uh cross over this bridge right here and then  
there's a church in the market around there 
and maybe get some food maybe buy something  
oh I can walk by here okay oh if you're ordering 
food here then you're basically standing on the  
middle of the road so ordering food here includes 
the the danger of getting hit by a car I think
hello oh people here are so friendly welcoming 
you saying hi I really miss the people of the  
Philippines probably one of the friendliest 
people in the whole world that's my experience  
from last year here okay so we do have the I 
think the name is kapo church right here and  
if I remember from last year I think this station 
wasn't here last year I remember that there was a  
walk through to enter the market that is behind 
the church oh maybe that's actually here oh yeah  
maybe my memory is not 100% correct over a year 
ago that I was here this is the main entrance of  
the church and then all the streets around here 
uh is basically one big Market hello hello good
afternoon oh hello hello I what are you selling 
here you Shai here homemade homemade we M up  
I can't I can't say no then okay let's see what 
she's selling here delicious chai what's inside

some delicious snacks here by the side of the road

can't handle it but I didn't saw how added it  
the chili is very spicy kind of a little bit 
or very spicy extremely hot extremely hot oh  
I think you said extremely hot let's see if 
I can eat it the fres that looks delicious

squeeze it over here oh check it out oh that's  
actually a lot of chili right guess I have to uh 
improve my stomach to be able to eat this okay  
so I squeezed two calaman over it let's start 
right here I think the the pce on the side here  
doesn't have so much chili on it and then we have 
I think this is soy sauce is this soy sauce soy  
sauce right sweet sace sweet homemade sauce oh 
everything homemade here okay let's give it a
try oh very good set up very good oh my God 
there's a huge piece of meat inside often when you  
get these your by the side of the road the meat 
actually inside is very small but here not sure  
if you can really see it but it's basically like 
a huge meatball and then we have the crispy uh  
garlic on it looks almost like a fried onions but 
uh I think it's garlic here let's find the second
piece
very good very
delicious but a little bit spicy yes gar a little 
bit spicy and the pie I just ate only had a little  
bit of chili on it so maybe I need to remove 
the chilies a little bit otherwise I might have  
to end this day pretty early yeah my stomach

else we can find and yeah I'm back uh beside the 
church now and we have uh wishing candles here I  
remember that from uh from last year actually so 
all of them here are selling the same products I  
think hello hello is this a wishing candle right 
here yeah so I can make a wish when I burn the  
candles oh actually why not give it a try one 
PES what is the difference between this colors  
and the the black one or the red one ah yeah so 
every color has a meaning yeah ah okay so for  
example if I burn a green candle then I get good 
luck with money I think if I burn the red candle  
it means family health courage so the the meaning 
is uh what I will receive when I burn it brown is  
traveling Fortune so if I burn the brown candle I 
get more luck in travel and Fortune yeah yeah and  
how much is the the whole package uh 100 100 for 
all of them yeah okay I get it and then I burn by  
myself right okay okay okay I wish but I don't say 
the wish right just in my head okay so you have to  
keep the wish to yourself actually that's also a 
tradition in Germany if we make a wish then you  
shouldn't tell it otherwise the wish will not come 
true okay okay all right let me think of a wish so  
I have all the colors now so I can make a wish for 
all of this yeah oh so I'm getting really lucky in  
the next weeks I guess let's see so I will make 
wishes in my head for yeah many of the things  
written here okay let me think of a good wish 
okay I got something I have a wish in my head  
now and now and now I put it on fire yeah Light 
It Up On Fire here let's see and then I have to  
hold it yeah you put you put here oh she's doing 
something with it okay okay ah we just uh stick  
it here so how long does it burn now for how many 
minutes um 5 minutes minutes 5 minutes 5 minutes  
what is written on the paper here I think there's 
like is it like a poem or something from the Bible  
yeah ah yeah there's something written on the 
on the papers there seems to be a good business  
here how many people here selling the same maybe 
like 20 so many so many people many people here  
yeah so it's all your friends or competitors 
friends friends okay good no competition here  
that's good to hear yeah you see a lot of that 
here and I guess people people do it here even  
before or after the church so people go to church 
and then they make a wish here yeah okay seems to  
be a tradition I'm always curious to learn about 
tradition and the cultures ah is this the the same  
that is written on on here ah so if you candle 
wishing candle but uh yeah I can't read it so if  
you can read it you have it right here before you 
that just read the all usually people read this ah
okayo probably my pronunciation is very bad I 
don't understand it no but PO is that Jesus yeah  
yeah oh Jesus from nazare yeah Jesus from naar 
right that's why I recognized it okay I think  
this will take a while let's pay for my luck 
okay 100 okay Salam thank thank you very much  
all right that was interesting learning a little 
bit about the culture here and uh the things that  
people like to do actually if you are from the 
Philippines let me know how common it actually  
is to do this is it something that you do on 
a regular basis or only when you go to church  
or let me know in the comments I'm curious to 
learn okay let's change to another area of the  
town uh I'm actually looking for massage I can 
need a massage and I know that there's one area  
of the town where you can find massages on the 
street and let's see if we can get there with  
the public transportation I think there's a metro 
line right here and this is my first time using  
the Metro here in Manila let's see how easy it is 
to use also as a foreigner all right and we have  
security here it doesn't seem to check anything 
hello where can I buy ticket where a ticket here  
a ticket office here okay thank you yes all right 
so looks like you have to go to one of the ticket  
boo here to get a ticket so see seems like there 
are no machines actually there's a machine Let's  
see if I can use the machine Let's see if the 
machine is maybe easy to understand select tarle  
oh it's already in English that's easy single 
Journey ticket you are here Caro and I want to  
go to I want to go to United Nations which one is 
this H un Avenue okay 20 pesos so you can only pay  
with the coins here or up to 100 is not accepting 
coins do you have a b or any kind of coins yeah  
this 10 okay why is the 20 coin not uh accepted 
uh I think uh the machine is not yet calibrated  
the coin because this is new oh this is a new 
coin yeah okay okay no problem only Bill okay  
so I get this coin back enter upstair and go 
up where are you going United Nations United  
Nations eastbound southbound going to Baka okay 
thank you very much oh very helpful people here  
okay so we have these machines here now we can 
go through ah so far so easy yeah obviously here  
in the Philippines everything is in English makes 
it very easy as a foreigner here but usually also  
in other countries that's my experience with uh 
taking the metro or the public transportations uh  
in another country the language would have been 
not an English at the beginning but usually you  
can always change it to English and then we have a 
station looking like this looks like proper railw  
tracks here and then there's no fans or gate here 
as it is in many other countries for example in  
Thailand or Malaysia so you need to be responsible 
for yourself not to fall over there I here stay  
behind the yellow line everything in English here 
and there the train is already coming towards
bakaran to be honest looks almost like a 
proper train not like a like just a Metro or
Subway hello hello not sure what he said 
but people smiling towards me all right  
oh it's air conditioned in here that's 
very nice coming from the heat outside  
the temperature here is very cool very 
nice and now I have to see where I need  
to get off I think it's here so where are we 
now uh I think we are here so it's only one  
two oh no we are here Caro and then only 
one two stations so it should be easy to
remember okay so we do have announcements here 
in English very convenient and actually the  
announcement was really loud sometimes 
in these metros it's not that easy to  
understand but here it was very clearly 
to here oh and he's standing on a little  
uh upright position there with a 
megaphone and a stop signal in his
hand not too many people are getting out here 
but yeah it's very full actually it's now uh  
early afternoon not sure what is usually the 
busiest time in here I guess probably early  
in the morning or late afternoon when people 
are going to work or going back from work the  
next station is United Nations United Nations 
station so you could hear the announcement in  
English is coming first before the tager look 
announcement that's actually quite interesting  
and we have arrived already that was now I don't 
know 4 5 minutes all right put it inside ah okay  
oh that was easy and by the way the price of a 
grab taxi for this uh Journey would have been  
around 150 pesos so that was very easy very 
convenient everything easy to understand so  
I would say that was a smooth ride can we 
commend and we'll do it again again good
impression okay and now it should be a short 
walk over to the area where I think you can  
find massages on the street but yeah to be honest 
guys I am very very happy to be back here I have  
great memories about my time in the Philippines 
last year in case you haven't seen my videos  
already last year I stayed for oh oh almost got 
hit by the car there W need to be careful here  
too busy talking to the camera need to watch on 
the roads more but uh yeah what I wanted to say  
is I stayed here in the Philippines for over 
4 months already last year and actually I came  
already back to the Philippines earlier this 
year but that was only for a 2 weeks holiday  
off camera I didn't film my second visit 
to the Philippines so technically this is  
already my third time here now but the second 
time that I'm going to film it because yeah I  
just really like this country and I have a lot 
of plans here for the next weeks I'm going to  
stay for around 2 months this time and I'm going 
going to visit some other AAS after Manila that I  
haven't been to yet so yeah stay tuned a lot 
of videos from the Philippines are coming oh  
check this out there's a chicken here two chicken 
actually actually pretty big chickens oh what are  
you guys doing here oh he's on a leash I'm just 
seeing that huh hello why is there chicken here  
is it fighting chicken fting fighting chicken 
and who's the owner oh wow oh interesting oh I  
saw that before in the provinces last year but 
I haven't seen this before in Manila yeah you  
always end up seeing interesting things when 
you just take a walk around the city here oh  
and actually I'm just seeing there's a Jollibee 
over there and I'm getting a little bit hungry  
maybe I should give jollybee another try what do 
you think guys I tried Jollibee already last year  
here in the Philippines obviously every prer who 
comes here tries Jolly Bee right and to be honest  
I wasn't 100% liking it but then I remember 
you guys in the comment section told me about  
other items I should try which are way better 
than the items that I did try so let's maybe  
give jollybee another try the famous jollybee 
let's give it a try okay let's see what we can
get yeah usually jollybee is always busy I 
think I've never seen an empty Jolly bees in the  
Philippines and yeah this time I'm going to order 
what you recommended in my comment section last  
last year so we have the famous chicken Joy the 
Fried Chicken we have the burgers the Yum Burger  
the cheese Yum Burger we have different sandwiches 
we have the Jolly spaghetti of course and actually  
that's what I'm going to try as well hi sir Jolly 
afternoon Jolly afternoon J oh that sounds funny  
okay happy Jolly afternoon I would like to have 
the Jolly spaghetti spaghetti just a spaghetti  
okay how about your drinks uh well you have Sprite 
Sprite yeah one Sprite please and then do you have  
the champ Burger yeah for 15 minutes okay one 
CH burger and then the the mango pie peach mango  
pie yeah Peach oh the peach mango pie one yeah 
that would be 296 7004 after 15 minutes sir you  
can take your order for number 20 this one will 
make a sound when the order is ready okay thank  
you all right so we are going to wait until this 
thing will make a noise and then I can collect the  
order let's have a look what we are having this 
time so I am having the famous jollybee spaghetti  
then we're having a dessert peach mango pie which 
I'm really looking forward to and then we have the  
champ Burger which was highly recommended from you 
guys in the comment section last year when I was  
here let's check it out oh that looks delicious 
actually wow yeah last year I tried the the basic  
Burger the Yum Burger I tried to Fried Chicken 
here and I think I had a chocolate pie but yeah  
thanks to you guys in the comments I'm here to 
give it another try and yeah in case you are not  
from the Philippines and you have no idea about 
this jollybee is a very popular fast food chain  
from the Philippines you can find it all over the 
country everywhere and yeah my understanding is  
that it's a very popular restaurant for the locals 
many people in the comments told me that they  
have a lot of childhood memories about visiting 
jollybee so I guess that people connect Jolly Be  
with a lot of memories so where to start I think 
I'm going to start with a spaghetti actually  
okay so I actually don't think that I ever ate 
spaghetti in a fast food restaurant before and  
yeah we're having spaghetti we have tomato sauce I 
think we have a hot dog sausages right here let's  
try them first oh I think it's actually quite 
sweet has a sweet taste to it it's not like a like  
a spiced flavor so I think it's a sweet tomato 
sauce let's roll it here like typical spaghetti  
I could imagine that this meal is popular for 
children spaghetti is simple with tomato sauce  
with hot dog sausages nothing too fancy easy quick 
to eat I guess every child likes spaghetti so you  
can't go wrong with that as a parent okay done 
with the spaghetti the spaghetti was quite good I  
prefer a sweeter taste like this way over a spicy 
taste for example so this is actually something  
that I would order again definitely but yeah now 
I'm very looking forward to this burger here The  
champ Burger I think this burger was mentioned 
probably 100 times in my comments on Tik Tok  
and on YouTube and yeah what are we having here 
so we have beef on it we have a lot of sauce we  
have tomato we have salad something else I think 
that's it R and cheese as well and yeah this uh  
compared to the Yum Burger looks like a proper 
Burger so the Yum Burger is basically like uh  
the hamburger in McDonald's like a small very 
thin Petty so this looks like a proper burger  
and we do have a lot of sauce here look at this 
WOW reminds me a bit about the ram Burger in  
Malaysia which also is it's a very Saucy burger 
oh but I think the flavor of the beef is actually  
very good okay this is already way way better than 
the Yum Burger so I can already understand why you  
guys recommended this to me now this is actually 
a proper Burger the only thing I would change it  
next time I would order it with less sauce usually 
I prefer less sauce and this one is yeah there  
sauce everywhere excuse me what would you say is 
the best thing I can try in jool be specifically  
the chicken Jo the chicken Joy chicken Jo okay 
it's their best brand and what is what Burger  
is the best burger any Burger any Burger uh it 
depends on your appetite I just tried the champ  
burger that was pretty good yeah but next time I 
want to try more yeah any Burg any Burger is good  
okay okay so there's more to try for next time 
but yeah now let's get the dessert go peach mango  
pie a little a little actually it's very small the 
packaging looks way bigger so fig it out it's only  
half the size of the actual package but yeah it's 
still warm which is nice so let's give it a try  
oh this is amazing oh have a look it's very warm 
from the inside it's very crispy a little bit of  
oily but the flavor of the cream inside here not 
really cream but this is more more like jam very  
delicious there's a very strong mango flavor to 
it which I really like even I think some proper  
mango pieces in here it tastes a little bit fake 
you know I don't think it's 100% real mangoes  
in here but the actual mango flavor was actually 
pretty good oh my perfect little dessert to finish  
this off great all right that was definitely a 
way better Jollibee experience than last year  
so thanks for your recommendations can I get 10
