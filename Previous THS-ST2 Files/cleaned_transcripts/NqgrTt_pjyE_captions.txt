Tell us something about yourself
Okay. Hi guys!
My name is Layan Salem, I live in Abu Dhabi. I'm from Jordan
I'm 25 years old... I feel like I'm saying a CV or something
I love creating content and I love marketing
this is like my field
And she's a badass by the way
But can I say that? Like in your language Jojopahin?
Jowa means boyfriend
It's like a...
- It's a filipino slang right?
- yeah
 
So tropa means friend
 
 
Jowa or Tropa. So let's get started
- Yey
- Let's go
 
 
 
I'm scared to say that I would and then like
everyone like I'm gonna say
like boyfriend? befriend?
I'd say..
tropa
- tropa?
- yeah
like he's really cute
but at the same time I would tropa.
Even though he got the hot looks
- like his stare though
- yeah he does
what I'm scared is that I'd miss my chance with the others
okay so his name is Daniel Padilla
so Daniel John Ford Padilla
is a filipino actor and
a recording artist. So by the way he sings
she sings as well. She really has a nice voice
In the shower

but he looks like a friend that you know...
- like a really cute friend
- what if I removed the girl beside him?
Yeah that's the thing
- Okay
- It's like
MOVE!
and they look young
he has a baby face
I think that's why I would tropa
So what do you usually look for in a man?
First of all, I ain't looking for a man
Exactly, that's the answer I'm looking for
let's go!
let's go!
But no really... I'd say the smile
and like he makes me laugh
like, I'm a sucker for anyone who makes me laugh
just make me laugh, be a clown for me baby
