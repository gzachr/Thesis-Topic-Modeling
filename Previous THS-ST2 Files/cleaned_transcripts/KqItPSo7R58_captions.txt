Hello guys!! how are you?!
Focus on this video!!!
Today we're here at Hanin Town Reastaurant ( Angeles City )
It's a lot different between day and night here, in terms of scenery and view
- When the night comes, lights are everywhere
I get a Christmas feeling
Beautiful women and handsome guys everywhere as well
- They must come here
What's your plan this coming Christmas?
- I don't have any
How about you Grey?
- I do have some plans, being with you guys
Why did you invite us here?
- To drink coffee and to have dinner
Today, we're going to try Sinigang here at Hanin Town restaurant
Do you remember before, I cooked sinigang for you guys
- Was it sinigang?
Before, you guys told me it was tasty
- Yes, maybe we did
At that time, I've realized that after shooting the video Grey put vinegar on my soup
Before, it's fake sinigang that you've cook
- So, we're going to try real sinigang cooked by a Filipino chef
So... where's our food?
- Wait... ate!
It's already served
It's been a long time since we made a mukbang video
- Sinigang here has different color than the ones we usually eat
It has this reddish color
- Let's try it first
The first on the menu is pork sinigang
This taste familiar to me since I've started YouTube
It's less sour than I expected
- Really? I thought it's sour enough
Do you know? most Korean tourists wanted to try sinigang?
- Who said that?
My friends
Children swimming over there looks very happy
The sinigang that Grey cooked is more better for me
- Because I made it less sour for you
It's been a long time since I had sinigang
I'm craving for something
You never mention soju before shooting the video
- Just try
Korean loves to drink soju together with tasty soup
You guys said before that sinigang is good for hang-overs
- It goes well with drink also
Can I skip the drinking?
- Shut up
Wait wait, I'm gonna' drink it after the sinigang
Hurry up
- I'm your checkpoint
Some people like him when drinking
They just had 1 shot then they act like they had a full bottle already
Those kids brings me back on my childhood, when I was a kid, I'm happy to eat some cup noodles after swimming
- The taste is the best in the world
Maybe they will do the same thing
- Do they eat instant noodles also after swimming?
Any food is delicious after taking a swim
Few days ago, the cases of infected by the virus here in Angels has dropped to 0%
Yesterday?
- 2 days ago
Really?
- Yes, it is real thank you Pogi Lazatin
Next one is shrimp sinigang
Do you know what shrimp in tagalog?
Hipon?
How did you know?
- Because you look like a shrimp
You're lucky, if the soup is hot, I would throw this soup to your face
Is it heavy?
- No, because my thumb is almost inside the bowl
Let's try it
- How's the taste? is it different from pork sinigang?
For me, shrimp sinigang fits my taste, what is it called? Sea-food sinigang? Sipon?
- Sinigang na Hipon
Did you said a bad word earlier? you called it like Shit-pon
By the way, sinigang is... wait, wait.
Sinigang is... later!
When I'm eating sinigang... ok, give it to me
When you try 'SI'-'NI'-gang
- Are you drunk?
I think a little bit
Do they put vinegar in sinigang when they cook it?
- As much as I know, it's not vinegar, I think it's a kind of fruit
Why did you put vinegar on my soup before?
- There is no reason
It's a prank
Did you remove the shrimp's skin?
Do I need to?
- How can you eat it without peeling the skin first?
But you did it...
- yes I did
Have you heard the story that shrimp is the same species with cockroaches?
- Yes I do
But it's just a rumor
But someone said it's true
Science journalists said it's just a rumor
If cockroaches tastes like shrimps, will you try it?
- Are you crazy?
If the cockroach tastes spectacular, will you try it?
Are you crazy too?
If it's cultured it's clean so I could eat it
- But the appearance is still cockroach
Cultured? it's freaking funny
Why did you use bad word?
- I'm already drunk
How can I call this in Tagalog? ( Egg plant )
- Tahong?
Tahong is mussel
Talong!!
- Yes! that's right
Some Tagalog words makes me confuse
Stop talking and let's drink
We're almost done, let's go home
- The sun is starting to set, it's time to drink
I already get a driver for you. you go home first
We already tried 2 kinds of sinigang, Shrimp and pork... which one do you like the most?
Yohan: Pork
Min: Soju
Ok
Sorry, it's shrimp
- Yohan chose pork and Min chose shrimp and my opinion is pork for me
Today I chose pork it because it depends on my appetite
If it's rainy days, people would choose shrimp
How'd you can be so sure?
- It's only for me, it's my opinion and I'm one of those people
Grey's sinigang is more good for me, because of the way he cooked it, it tasted more likely Korean
- That's me
I mean... not your cooking skills
- but you chose my sinigang anyway
Listen to me first
Your sinigang is less sour, so it's close to my likings
Anyway, mine's tasted good
- What? you're tasty?
I'm going home now
- Finish this video first
