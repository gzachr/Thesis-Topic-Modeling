Today guys
I am making laing with bangus.
I told you last time that i would make
laing with dilis but I decided to
put the dilis in the next dish... okay so
instead of laing i'm using
bangus today and we will have visitors
Filipinos
who will try the dish later guys so please
stay tuned for their reaction i'm really
curious
what they would think of my dish laing
with boneless bangus
okay on the baboy i will put some
mantika
to make the baboy extra crispy
Exciting guys i'm making this laing dish
for the first time and also bangus,
boneless bangus i've never cooked it so
now real Filipinos can taste my dish
as you can see guys i used lots of uh
sibuyas and bawang
today so um i thought it might make the
dish
more tasty also luya i have
quite some luya here so i'm gonna add it
so later i will also add lots of sili
and
alamang
it's time to add the alamang oh the
wrong one
alamang is here so when i add
alamang always
usually there's many flies coming so i
want to do this quickly
nice
Filipino food from Bicol!
okay now i'm gonna add three packages of
coconut milk to the dish
okay it's time to add the laing guys,
taro leaves
the laing smells good guys i'm gonna
reduce the heat a little bit gonna add
lots of
chili peppers
and then i will cover it and put the
temperature down and
start preparing the bangus
okay in the meantime i'm going to fry
bangus
a little bit of mantika
The laing and the bangus is almost
ready guys so uh let's uh
do the plating and then have the guests
taste the dish okay
