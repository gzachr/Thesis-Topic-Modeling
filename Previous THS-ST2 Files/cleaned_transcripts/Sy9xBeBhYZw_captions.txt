today's the day today is the day we are leaving 
thailand as i'm sure you've seen from the title  
of this video we are moving to the philippines 
it's a little bit of a bittersweet moment because  
we've spent most of our time here in thailand 
for two years and we're actually a little sad  
to leave so in this video we're going to 
show you our travel journey getting to the  
philippines we are going via singapore and 
then we will be flying straight to manila  
that's so exciting we're going to tell you 
everything we're going to tell you why we're  
moving to the philippines where we're going what 
we're doing but first we've got to check in it's  
currently 6 p.m and our first flight is at 9 00 pm 
it's an hour and a half to singapore and we will  
have a five-hour layover from about midnight to 
five in the morning i can't actually believe that  
we're leaving thailand this is actually our first 
international flight in two years it's like i'm a  
newbie i don't even know what to do even though 
i've traveled domestically a billion times in  
thailand i'm so excited i don't think we're gonna 
get any sleep in about 24 hours but i'm so ready
going to singapore you
let's be real about those requirements make sure 
you get all your documents you do not want to be  
left stranded at that chicken disk i 
have to say they were extremely thorough  
they checked all of our documents and made 
sure we had all the correct requirements  
and to get into the philippines briefly you need 
a negative either pcr test or an antigen test  
you need to have a return ticket coming out 
of the country and you have to apply for a  
one-house pass very similar to like 
the thailand pass to get into thailand  
and you need proof of your insurance i will 
put all the requirements in the description  
below and i will link a very helpful youtube 
channel a lady called jennifer terry who is  
from the philippines and she is helping all the 
people come into the country are you waiting  
real quick we just want to say a big thank you to 
surfshot for sponsoring this video and keeping our  
online data safe while we travel with the best vpn 
on the internet since we rely on internet wherever  
we go using public wi-fi in coffee shops and like 
right now in the airport is unavoidable and even  
though this wifi is convenient when you connect 
your data is vulnerable and that's why we choose  
surfshark as our vpn of choice if you don't know 
a vpn stands for a virtual private network which  
encrypts all of your information sent between 
your computer and the internet so no one can  
steal your private data and the best part is a vpn 
lets you virtually travel the world by changing  
your location to a different country allows you 
to unlock different content libraries for example  
ship's favorite show of all time is pretty little 
liars but it's not available on netflix here  
but if we change our location to 
the uk then we get access to it  
and chev is happy with just one subscription 
you can have unlimited devices connected  
so for us we can have all our laptops and our 
phone secure plus there's a 30-day money-back  
guarantee so there's absolutely no risk to try 
it out to get 83 off plus an extra three months

i'm a little sad it's just because thailand 
is always going to be so memorable for us it's  
the place that we came to start our journey in 
2020 it's the place that we started our channel  
all the incredible people that we've met all 
the incredible thai people they've made our trip  
so memorable every single person every single 
one of you that subscribed thank you so much for  
doing that we definitely wouldn't be doing this 
without you even though that we're going we will  
always come back because thailand is so special 
to us so we were so lucky to spend so much time  
here in thailand and we will remember every single 
moment from the time we started where we couldn't  
even speak to the camera hey guys we're 
seven dave welcome back to our channel  
up till now we can't even tell 
you how thankful we are so  
thank you thank you thailand i'll miss you 
one of the things i'll miss in thailand
as i said the process was very seamless 
we are flying with scoot airlines  
which for those of you that 
don't know is a subsidiary  
of singapore airlines which is why 
we're flying via singapore and when
and then when we get to singapore we 
will tell you why we are leaving thailand
thank you
we'll be back
okay ready i got the window seat we've 
never been on scooter airways but it's  
really really packed so it's kind 
of nice to see international travel  
kind of back to normal mask 
before turning the oxygen bar  
for the sound shots even at the overweight 
during the recommendation to not to keep a number
we made it we're in singapore there's 
always that one guy that's just so cute
thank you goodbye
so the time difference is an hour ahead 
of thailand so it's technically midnight  
we check into our next flight at 4 a.m
explore this beautiful airport because it is the 
world's best airport so let's see what we can find
because we're actually here at midnight every 
single store is closed what else is also closed  
is our gate so we have no idea which way we're 
going so we're going to try and figure that  
out before 4 a.m so now that we've arrived in 
singapore we want to tell you the reason why  
we have left thailand and are making our way to 
the philippines the reason is because we want to  
travel and see the world as much as we can and 
because philippines opened at this time we just  
thought it would be an amazing opportunity 
to stretch our legs and go explore but we're  
so excited to just explore a new place explore 
a new culture and that's what we want to show  
you in our upcoming videos philippines has always 
been on our bucket list in fact it's actually been  
at the top of our bucket list for so long and as 
we said we've never been to the philippines so if  
you've been please send us some recommendations or 
your experience when you were in the philippines  
this is what life is like after midnight 
in singapore because our gate hasn't opened  
yet we're kind of having to roam around and 
wait and we're in one of the biggest airports  
so we're completely lost right now and there's 
absolutely nobody here all the shops are closed  
restaurants are closed so it's it's a good 
time and it's midnight and we're exhausted  
we're currently just following the people like 
she yes this so if you want to know what to do  
in the changi airport in singapore when it's 
two in the morning and you've practically  
got nothing to do because everything is 
closed you take a nice ride on the cart
this is fun and we're like the 
only ones here roaming around  
and we're losing our minds pretty 
much the most exciting thing was  
the overpriced 7-eleven where everything 
was 10. oh don't leave keep pushing
so one of the main attractions in the changi 
airport is something known as the jewel which  
is the tallest indoor waterfall in the world 
it's 70 meters tall and it cost 1.3 billion  
unfortunately at this time 
because of the situation  
we're not allowed to access it so normally 
you can go straight through and exit the  
airport to see the jewel but right 
now we cannot do that which is so sad
there's just something about sitting on the 
airport floor at three in the morning so we are so  
excited to finally be going to the philippines now 
that we've told you why we're going there there's  
just so many things that we want to see we want to 
go and do as much as possible we absolutely love  
the philippines we want to go and try new food 
we want to go and see things we've never seen  
do things we've never done before and we're just 
so so excited and i'm sure we it kind of seems  
like kind of random that we're going there but 
it has been on our list for so long i think now  
the transportation and the ability to fly to 
other countries is going to get much much easier  
which is cool for us our goal is to travel as 
much as we can here in southeast asia and we're  
going to see how long we stay in the philippines 
because we might be going somewhere else very soon
this is what's happening 
right now don't worry i'm good
airport life oh no how did you
you're stripped here but not here 2 59. oh 
we're losing it clearly for one hour until  
boarding gate opens but two hours until we take 
off oh if you get stuck in there this is going  
to be a problem i think shave is also losing her 
mind she's gone on a stroll oh no she's running
we have like this whole little area to ourselves 
and this is kind of what we've been up to  
so after waiting a very long and very 
painful few hours it is currently  
4 00 am so we're about to check in to 
our flight now and then we have around  
about a three hour flight from here to manila i 
think we're practically delirious at this point  
but i'm so so excited get me to manila 
i think we're obviously gonna pass out  
as soon as we arrive and then we're just 
gonna hit the town as soon as we recover
don't mind me drinking fountain water that's the 
only thing we can afford in singapore airport  
is the free fountain order
thank you bye bye bye one more flight
hi
feeling like a zombie
is
thank you
that was i don't know if you can tell but we 
look absolutely pooped we've had the longest  
journey here to manila but we finally finally 
made it we went through immigration it was a  
breeze and we're here with touchdown in manila 
obviously we couldn't film the process through  
immigration but we just wanted to tell you if 
there's anybody that's coming to the philippines  
the process is very very easy before you get on 
your flight they ask you for all your documents  
and if you have those the process is very very 
simple yes your one health pass is the most  
important so make sure you do that before you 
board but as for us we can't wait to show you  
what manila is like what the philippines is 
like and that's going to be in the next video  
so don't forget to subscribe we're going to head 
out for now we're going to go catch some z's yes  
counter taxi and we'll see you in the next one bye
you
