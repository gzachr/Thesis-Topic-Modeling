you were right i wasn't expecting 
that i don't know what it is but i  
love it she's gonna toast up the intestine 
for us oh i need help are you brave enough  
this is exactly what we came here for 
that was kind of surprising what a
so we have made it to quran we're in the quran 
town and today we're just going to walk around  
we're going to experience what it's like 
here in quran i'm sure it's a different  
vibe to el nido since we're on a remote 
island in the middle of the philippines
corona is known for lagoons snorkeling diving 
there are shipwrecks beautiful islands and  
beaches to see and we're gonna try and do as 
much of it as we can in the time that we are  
here but today let's go out explore see what 
the quran town is like koran is a municipality  
in palawan and it makes a part of the kalamian 
islands and koran island is one of those islands  
but we are staying in karon town proper which 
is the west side of the bigger baswanga island  
we've actually been so lucky to see so many sides 
of the philippines in just a short amount of time  
and what i've already noticed is that every 
place we go the tricycles look completely  
different to other cities like in manila or even 
in el nido which is just a short boat right away  
the tricycles already have their own style or 
their own unique look it's actually really cool  
we thought quran would be completely dead and 
quiet because of the situation but it does seem  
that there's some energy some people are coming 
back we have seen a few tourists since we arrived
even though the main attraction here is 
obviously the incredible island hopping  
but we really like to go and explore the town get 
the lay of the land see what everything is about  
get ourselves settled into a place find out 
what's happening before we go on the island tours
so how we got to coron is we had to take a ferry 
from el nido to quran town and the ferry cost us  
2 650 pesos each it was a little expensive in 
my opinion we do think it was a little expensive  
but it's okay online it said it was two and a 
half hours on the ferry but it took five hours  
unfortunately it was really long and really 
bumpy so i don't know if we would recommend it  
but it was an experience no thank you they asked 
us for a tricycle about every five seconds yes  
they want to take us to a beach 
or somewhere which is so sweet  
i who don't normally feel seasick or motion 
sick at all i felt very very sick on the ferry  
we will put all the details to how we 
booked the fairy in the description below
it looks like a dremel yeah we can try 
one it's a spring roll with potato inside  
well no way it looks so good and this looks good 
too it looks like it's got some coconut i got my  
little vinegar in a packet i don't know how to do 
it you have to bite it you have to bite it again
and these are only 15 pesos really delicious 
it's like a spring roll this makes them i think  
i could have these for breakfast maybe every 
day i think something we like to do when we  
go to a new place is just eat some of the food 
it kind of always gives us a vibe of what the  
place is like or anything that we can find that 
looks amazing so couldn't say no to the spring
this is what we really do shave just walks 
around the town finding dogs he's tied up
he's in a little bit of a parking 
spot right now he's just waiting  
we've just found a cute coffee shop called epic 
coffee and i've decided to get an iced latte i  
got a hot latte so we're just going to enjoy this 
and then i think we need to do some more exploring

a shortcake or a shortbread something like that
koran is a bustling town i think we've 
ended up in like peak hour traffic  
it's so busy noisy i was not expecting this on 
a quaint little island i'm so happy about this  
because everything is open and we get to just 
be in the hustle and bustle of this little town  
for all our thai viewers we have found thai 
food on thai it looks so good it's legen
we are going to try one of the highly rated 
filipino delicacies and that's letter which is  
like grilled chicken we couldn't help ourselves 
when we walked past it was smelling so so good  
we're like okay we have to stop and try this has 
turned into almost like a food vlog or us trying  
different food but just walking around the city 
we've been attracted to so many different things  
to snack on and eat so we couldn't help ourselves 
so i hope you've enjoyed watching us try different  
food today well this is exactly what we came 
here for we came to get totally stuck into the  
culture and i have to say this has been something 
that i would highly highly recommend that you try  
south africa south africa
a lot of chickens
look at that oh it's piping hot my 
good old-fashioned vinegar sauce  
so i've also got my calamansi 
lime which i'm just gonna sprinkle  
all over we just kind of made the side booth on 
it all workstations workstation and he's given  
us this to be a little bit daring so i'm just 
gonna put a little bit on my first bite let's go
oh my goodness this has got to be my favorite 
thing so far the sourness from the vinegar  
and the lime just makes it oh it's just 
perfect like a an explosion of flavor
there's a reason why this is a delicacy 
and so popular especially here in palawan  
oh as chef said this is going to be our 
favorite devin and i are so funny we've  
kind of been eating sweet and savory at the same 
time you're probably thinking why are they eating  
dessert and why are they eating chicken like all 
mixed up well as soon as we see it we eat it so  
that's how it's going it's just too many good 
things too many we can't can't help ourselves
oh some dessert this looks good we've literally 
just had the chicken and now why not there is a  
special dessert that we've been wanting to try yes 
everybody's recommended it to us i'm so excited  
we finally get to try hello hello i think we're 
going to have some fun here in koran i'm already  
having the best time just by eating i mean the 
way to your heart is through your stomach right  
they actually have something here in 
the philippines called a coke float  
now that brings me straight to my childhood which 
is obviously coke with ice cream on top and if  
you've never ever had it you've like never had 
a childhood like you should definitely have that  
and we need to get one because i i haven't had one 
since i was like five and when we had one when we  
were so young our parents knew that we were just 
going to be running around jumping off the walls  
on a major sugar rice ice cream and coke together  
it's a disaster for children parents nightmare 
we don't recommend it no i'm kidding oh my god  
it's bigger than you i don't know what it is but 
i love it this is crazy it's got like corn plate  
ice cream it's got jelly it's filled to 
the brim it's actually leaking all over my  
my hands so i'm going to take a 
little bite of whatever i could find
it's sweet um it's crispy from the the 
cornflakes on top i want to taste the jelly  
oh it's coming out the other side oh i need help 
there are so many things packed inside of this  
what is this oh my goodness
if we this must be every filipino child's best day 
ever because i feel like a kid right now diving  
into all of like the best things a kid could have 
oh everything's falling out everything's running  
away whoa there's like little jelly beans honestly 
like a party in a cup jelly beans jelly ice cream  
oh my god it's like a treasure hunt and this was 
only 95 pesos because you've got so much going on  
here you don't know what you're gonna get in every 
bite so it's kind of like a surprise every time
