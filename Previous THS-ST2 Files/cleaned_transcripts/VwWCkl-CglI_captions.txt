Nice voice!
Versace on the Floor
Wow, the voice is so clean
Yes, He has nice clean voice
His vocal cord is a bit different. I think it is short
so his voice is specialized in high range, also his breathing is stable, so He can control his voice that well
So surprising
I am so envy his voice
Cause this kind of voice must have Innate ability
So envy
I am female vocal , but has husky voice
I want to have his clean voice though
and also harmonic overtone at low range is nice
He has lots of things
and when he hits the high range, and then pull out the power, that's nice
Break points also clean, and nice
so atrractive
Well, this song has piano instruments,
but when he sings with guitar, it feels brand new
and also fits to him
let's see more
nice
Now I know what you told me, about the low range
lol he smiles!
so attractive
nice, cool
His performance is outstanding, with only guitar
without instruments, this vocal will be nice
so attractive
How can he sings like that?
probably lots of girls like him
nice
Maybe he can hits more high range, but he didn't
Let's see him more
