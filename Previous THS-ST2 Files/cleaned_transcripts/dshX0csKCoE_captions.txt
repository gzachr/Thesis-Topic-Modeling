hello - hello, and welcome to a new episode of our vlog Travel N2
my name is valentin
my name is Mihaela
and today we are in Manila - the Philippines capital city
Manila has 12 or 16 districts
around administrative centre - Metro Manila
we are now in the district Makati
a tiny city, like Valentin said early
and we have only few hours to explore it
and this is because, we are here only to change the country
we are flying out from the Philippines into another destination, we'll not say yet
it was inevitable not to visit Manila
if we only have few hours, we must see somethings
at least the surroundings of Makati
we arrived last night, and went for a walk
and i find it kinda ugly
it is like Red Light District but more aggressively
unfriendly
and because we did not plan anything, just opened google maps and walked in a direction
we arrived in Ayala Park
it is a clean park with a lot of  restaurants in the left side
Italian restaurants, coffee shops, sweets shops
what i like, even thou i am not happy with this
in this park you can not smoke
at the exit of the park we found a restaurant where we could smoke on the terrace
and for the parents that are with the kids here i think is a great idea
we've seen here people that exercise, a dad with two kids that play with a drone
they have picnic on the grass
and what a read was that one of the great time to be in this park is around Christmas or New years eve
because in that period, here are some light shows
with led light in the trees
and a lot of fun parties
and also in weekends, lots of people come here at concerts in the Triangle Ayala part
long live trip adviser
Ayala park is a place in Manila that you can hide from all the noise in the city
so we also relax in this park along side the other people here
look, the unknown is colored
and as we walked around Green Belt Garden
we found a place for prayers  for the people of the area that looks so festive
not sadness but inspiring for  the good things that God gives you
every family brings a colored star with his name on it and puts it there
and this place is now more colorful and beautiful
this happens when you don't have a plan and go "somewhere" and discover new places and new and fun people
dears, now is the time to say goodbye from Manila
goodbye Philippines
i am sad
why?
because i loved the Philippines
i can't say the same about Manila
but now we are at the hotel, took our luggage and we're going to the airport
we arrived last night in Manila, and today we had few hours to visit around Makati - the district where we have the hotel
3-4 hours at maximum
in witch 1 hour was the time from point a to point b
i want to start with the feeling that i had last night when we arrived and we didn't film anything
it was past 1 am when we arrived and we were super tired
and the camera remained in the hotel
we went out for some food in this area
we we stepped outside the hotel i had a weird feeling that agitate me
i didn't like it
i considered everyone weird
lot of aggressive commerciants
lots of girls at corners
but first lets say about the first impression of the city when we arrived
strictly about the people that we found here in Manila
when we arrived in the airport
what about the first 2 taxi drivers...?
the first two taxi drivers wanted to steal us
wanted for us to pay 10 times more the fee
then we walked to the authorized taxi
and then that taxi driver didn't use the taximeter
he negotiated with us
like allover the philippines
it is not a problem with us, we want to help somehow
but is because we want to
but because we want not because you want to steal
then we arrived at the hotel, went out for some food
and i saw the people around weird, aggressive
i didn't like the feeling, believe me, every time i had my hand on the  wallet
i was scared
the truth is that i read about this area a lot on trip adviser and google reviews
they say that this area is cleaner and safe
everybody says to be careful where you keep your wallet or your phone
i just watched out for the wallet
because here are a lot of pick pocket thiefs
they start to talk with you and somehow your phone is stolen
here in Manila the poverty is high and are a lot of contrasts
in one place you see skyscrapers and opulance
and in one meter you see a kid that sleeps on some stairs
and i didn't liked it because
i felt guilty because i can not do something to help
i was insecure and unsafe
i never felt something like the feeling to not like a city
last light when we arrived in the room, cuddled in bed and i said that i don't like this city
this because we are coming from the islands and we are used to one type of relaxation
other feelings and other kind of people
we don't speak about the architecture or the infrastructure of the city
we didn't like the people
we we got up, in the morning i didn't want to get out and explore the city
just wanted to enjoy a coffee and wait for the time to go to the airport
but Valentin wanted to see a small part of Manila, so...
i wanted to see the city on daylight not only that sad part in the night that we just saw
and the places that he picked to visit today
"picked"
i just opened google maps and wanted to see the surroundings of the hotel to have time to get back and go to the airport
and the places that he picked and that we saw today changed  a little my mind about the city
i felt ok in a park near some families
with some nice restaurants and a shopping mall
another part of Manila that i felt more safe and more beautiful
day and night contrasts
and it is good that we're leaving tonight :))
soon we'll have to go to the airport
we are here in Manila because we came from Bohol
ad we're flying to an other destination, still in Asia
is safe to take some connecting flights  with a lot of time between them
that is why we wanted a night here in manila
the Cebu Pacific intern flights have a lot of delays
and to be sure not to loose any flight we choose to see a small part of Manila
if i can say, i will not recommend a visit in Manila, just only if you have to
even thou the parks and this day it was nice
i don't consider that is a touristic capital
so only if you have to be here, is ok
there are some things that you can do here
there are some tours, but in the outside of Manila
we've seen them but we didn't had time to do them
last year, we we traveled in Thailand, and saw the islands and got relaxed and mind clear
and then in Bangkok some full days
first it shocked us because it was so crowded
because we were so relaxed
and than we saw this full city
then we did say to us that we'll always to the opposite
first see the capital and then the islands
but still we are not doing that :))
we recommend you to do that :)
these are learning experiences and hope to not repete it
soon we'll release an episode in witch we talk about the full experience from the Philippines
an amazing country
with good and bad - in Manila :)
and that for you to see the full experience and see if we recommend it or not
our Adventure in the Philippines ends now
i am very sad because we are leaving the Philippines
the memories from the islands will remain in my soul forever
it is a destination in witch you have to arrive
and, why not, to get here also in Manila
but first :)
we have mixed feelings now, and we'll have to be back here because there are a lot of places that we didn't see
in the Philippines and in Manila
this is kind of an ending of this series
hope you loved our adventures from the Philippines
here comes a new country, a new series of adventures and experiences
and this is it
