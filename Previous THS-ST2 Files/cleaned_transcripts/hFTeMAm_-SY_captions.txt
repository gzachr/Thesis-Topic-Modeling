once again hello to team infineon
they asked me to do a shoutout for them
i received a lot of
comment
and also they send me messages in messenger
about
one issue
and that will be the
MIC
so do you hear me
no
if not i have a solution for that
so i decided
to end up
to buy this kind of mic
that they said
its super effective for vlogging
so let see we will try this one
so  now this is the
mic
here you go guys
so this is the mic i bought
they said this is super amazing
it is more louder than
mic out there!
lets try it now
it sounds good
lets try
hello?
wow
hello
nice
so now let see if still you cannot hear me well
what is this!
seriously ill use this?
ok then just to be different
for unique
its because
now mostly all of them is just same in youtube
now where going to talk about
if
it is really expensive to travel in bangkok thailand
for ofw
like me
same like you
same for all
or even for those who are not ofw
the one im sharing now
those ways i did
if how i save my
budget
in bangkok when i visited
so lets start now
when i visited bangkok
if you are added in my facebook
or in my instagram
a lot of people asked me if
how did you go there?
is it expensive to travel there?
how much money i spend?
or which places you visited?
if its OK
something like that
so actually guys
when i travel to bangkok
i didnt
wait!
i thought its battery empty
so again when i visited bangkok
i didnt hire or get a tour guide
or i didnt go to a travel agency
which is
even though im a travel coordinator
i didnt go to any travel agency
so i make my own travel plan
i make my own itinerary
i purchased my own ticket going there
i booked my own hotel online
and also
those places i visited
actually
i google it
what i did is
when i was still in dammam saudi
i did it in google map
starting from my hotel
which is the places nearby to go to
and then i make a screenshot
its like the line direction in
google map
so i save it
and do screenshot
and thats the one i use as a reference
on how i will go there
and then at the same time
i google again
for some
like what ive said
tourist place i make notes
for those places to visit
and at the same time
luckily
cause my hotel is
very near in
although the location is quite in the end of the city of bangkok
but then its near in some tourist spot in bangkok
so thats it
next question is
airfare and hotel booking
actually my airfare is
my air fare is i booked it tru philippine airlines
thats the airfare i got
for only less than 4,000 pesos
probably 4,000 pesos
less than 4,000
lets just say 3,500 pesos for air fare
which is philippine airlines
and its roundtrip fare
going there and coming back to manila
actually i did not came from dammam
so what i did is i go to
i made my booking in manila
and then manila to bangkok
then bangkok to manila
so i have seperate ticket
its not included on my coming back to saudi
and then my hotel actually
and then
sorry
i almost forgot
the travel tax
and the terminal fee
terminal fee is 500 pesos
and then
the travel tax sorry
travel tax
that is 1,620 pesos
we are not exempted
for the travel tax
its because
where going to bangkok as tourist
and we are not working in bangkok
for all OFW
dont tell that your a ofw
so you will be exempted in travel tax
thats not the case
youll be exempted on travel tax only on your working place
so if your purpose is for tourism  in bangkok
so you still need to pay for travel tax
alright
and then
the next one is the hotel
so the hotel i went to is
i booked it tru booking.com
so i search for the lowest rate hotel
so this is the one i found
if you want to know the name of the hotel
ill include it on the description
for this video you can search there
regarding the hotel actually
its not 5 star or 4 star hotel
its a 3 star hotel
but
that hotel its a small hotel
but its very cheap the one i got
i stay in bangkok for
4 days and 3 nights
so i got the hotel rate for
for only 1,500 pesos only
so if your going to convert it to riyal
probably i think
maybe 120 riyal or less than that
depend on exchange rate
so 1,500 pesos
if im going to convert it to peso its
that will be good for 4 days and 3 nights stay
and the hotel amenities
its nice very nice hotel
actuall if i am going back to bangkok
ill stay in the same hotel
because the amenities is great
wifi is fast
of course we need fast wifi
cause we need to
for us to upload our photos
so wifi is very important
and then the good thing is they have
2 things i like
on that hotel
actually the hotel has
its own indoor pool
they have private indoor pool actually
when i was there im alone using the pool
no one is with me in pool
i feel like i rented the whole pool
but it was superb
cause in bangkok its humid
so you really need to
its very hot there
youll be sweat a lot
so guys if your going ouside activity in bangkok
during summer
make sure you have or bring hankerchief or extra clothes
cause its really humid in bangkok
its much hotter than manila philippines
thats what they says
which is true
and then the second goo thing in that hotel is
is the free breakfast
this is the breakfast
actually its a coupon
cause there free breakfast
is not in the hotel facility itself
so you need to go outside of the hotel
youll go to the next hotel beside my hotel
youll see a tall building
and its on a 12th floor
the buffet area
but its worth it
breakfast is worth
if you are in my facebook account
youll see that on my bangkok album
the food that they served
buffet style breakfast
a lot of food choices
food is worth it
so my airfare is 3,500 pesos
my hotel is only 1,500 pesos
good for 4days and 3 nights stay
and my hotel is
shared bathroom
i dont have a private bathroom
but is ok
because their bathroom is so clean
and no one is using that much
so its ok if you dont have your private bathroom
on that hotel
which is ok cause
youll just take shower or
make pu
which places i visited in bangkok
so guys
the place i visit which is very near in my hotel is
golden buddha
wat traimit
i dont kknow if i pronouce it correctly
and also the
china town gate
i dont know if the is the name
its like a big gate there
once you pass that gate
youll be in chinatown in bangkok
so that is the tourist place near on that hotel
and then
and also train station is near on that hotel
i almost forgot to mention
so its near also
so if you want to discover other places
in bangkok
within the city you can go aroung for it by train
and the train rate  is cheaper also
it was like
30 bhat
for one ride journey
30 or 50 bhat something like that
i cant remember exactly
but the price range is like that
convert it youself
if how much bhat to peso
but still cheaper
so in china town when i go there
i went there 2 times
cause there's a lot of food
everything is there
street foods
thai restaurant
thai street foods
so you can tastes it over there
authentic thai food
its super
spicy
its like......
too much chilis
but then if you are not tolerable in spicy
you can simply ask the vendor
dont put to much chili its ok
but if you really want to experince thai food
which is very very spicy
so go for it
cause its once in a lifetime experience
is it expensive
food in bangkok
actually
for me no
actually i think its much cheaper than manila
cause when i was there
i only have
my pocket money is
12,000 pesos
12,000 pesos is my travel budget
when i go there
its including for payment for hotel, travel tax, terminal fees, transportation,  food, souvenirs
but the question is
i have 12,000 pesos
but then when i return to manila
i still save
4,000 pesos
so its means i spent only for 8,000 pesos
when i go to bangkok for 4 days and 3 nights
including food hotel transportation and souvenirs
for souvenirs
actually there is a
area called MBK Station
MBK mall
so its like the divisoria of bangkok
so all there is cheap for souvenirs stuffs
so you can buy there very cheap shirts or keychain, ref magnet
or anything
anything for souvenirs
so you can go there
if you want to go to that store
so its MBK mall or MBK shopping mall
thats the name i guess
total experience
that is the last question i have
to all my friends in facebook and instagram
what is my total experience in bangkok
actually i had a great experience
in bangkok
actually i really want to go back to bangkok
but i think i will explore other side
not the bangkok itself
maybe ill go to pattaya
what do you called that famous
famous beach in bangkok
thats it
that area i want to visit next time
aside from bangkok
so thats it
i had a great experience in bangkok
its totally amazing
its really unforgettable experience
its because
thai people are nice
they are very welcome to foreigners
and i dont have any bad experience in bangkok
cause the taxi driver is
just say the location  you want to go
lets say you will go to grand palace
so they already knew
if where it is
but my tips for you guys in bangkok
dont ever
dont make any deal
contract
so make sure every time you will take taxi
make sure that they will accept meter
cause sometimes
its same like in manila
they use to have contract
make sure guys
its always
they will use their meter
instead of doing  contract
that is the one problem in bangkok
cause they want to earn more of course
so thats is be careful
from taking taxi
my experience everything is ok in bangkok
so i recommended it
to all ofw out there
planning to travel to bangkok
thats the
tips for you guys
today for this vlog
so if your  planning to go there
with your family
or for your own self
bangkok will be the good option
for OFW
