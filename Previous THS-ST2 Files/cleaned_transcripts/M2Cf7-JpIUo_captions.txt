This is one of the most unique 
places I've ever been to it's a 7-11 
but wait, wait, wait
hear me out!
yes it's all business upfront as a 
fully functioning convenient store  
but walk into the storage room on the 
left side and pull aside a curtain to  
enter one of manila's BEST hidden bars 
decked out in graffiti projections,  
music and a fully stocked cocktail bar that serves 
up some of the most delicious cocktails in town!
I especially recommend the mariang bastos 
which is one of their house specials
definitely add Bank bar in BGC to 
your must visit places in Manila!!
