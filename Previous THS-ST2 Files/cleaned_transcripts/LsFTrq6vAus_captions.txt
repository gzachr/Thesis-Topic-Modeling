exactly the same they make pancakes
put mince in there and fry them exactly
the same
 
we have something the same as well in
brazil
uh like we call croquette we have beef
and chicken
inside but it's just a different um
the way they yeah the way they made yeah
the rep is different
this is nice but since i was very little
i never liked that when my
grandmother used to make pancakes with
meat i used to hate it
so it's kind of bringing back bad
memories but it's very good
but but it's it's very nice it's very
nice
so i'll have another one i don't know
what it's coming
so how can i rate this four i'll fight

like vinegar and soy sauce it's called
adobo from the spanish word adobar which
is like to marinate so it's marinated in
vinegar and soy sauce

beginning I
I feel like was a little sweet but it's
not sweet
yeah it's like taste is like normal
chicken
rice sauce is um just like a normal
gravy sauce i think no a little bit more
sweet but the look there's this chef
i need the word of the chef because the
look is very
very questionable but no it tastes very
good so

it's called sinigang
it's a sour soup or stew
it's usually made with tamarind that's
why it's sour and then you pair it with
rice
and that is pork but usually you can
cook it with beef and fish and chicken
as well

- yeah you know usually eat it with rice
so you put the rice on the plate and then
pour the
- ah okay /- rice again?

first because i like this the look of this
this one is called pancit palabok yeah so it's a noodle
dish
it's again with a bit of shrimp sauce
topped with like
cooked shrimp or like boiled pork and
then we usually serve it like during
birthdays
or like special occasions because in
chinese belief it's like for a long life
because of the noodles so instead of
birthday cake you get this?
with the birthday cake / - oh okay
usually in birthdays we prepare noodles
cause like noodles is usually / - it signifies long life
depends because this noodles look
look like I'm not gonna live

this
this is
normally i'm not
like fan of noodles that much but i like
this one
the sauce is nice the egg is not bad
actually
in here everything is not bad
but the noodles because this like
spaghetti more like that's why i like
because normally i don't like noodles
because it doesn't have a taste
but this one maybe it's the sauce it got
a nice taste i think
let me try again
yeah the eggs is nice as well
the noodles they jump in the mouth you
know you can't catch them
they're very texture is different very different
- i like this / - I'm still catching them
the sauce is really nice the noodles are
nice
the egg surprisingly was not bad with
noodles so
this is nice no this is nice dish this
was better than seasick and
whatever there this is four for me four
four that's fine
this is four
how about you coach?
still thinking
she's still thinking why she gave last
dish five
that's what she's thinking because this
is really nice
can i take some home?
okay this is second best
4 and a half
all right
tadah this is just..
that looks like dirty water
- that looks like.. / - the water from the..
that looks like something out of the
puddle
 
- you know what you know when it's raining
and then you have / - yeah yeah
and someone steps with dirty shoes yeah
hundred percent oh you played this first i tried
it before you know i liked you very much
/ - this is just optional will they taste it
first yeah
taste it first then she'll explain that
this is chicken
you know i should say that because she's like
"let them taste first, then we're gonna tell them what it is"
yeah that's what i'm saying
wait let me smell
there's two versions
there's two who?
versions
there's two alike
we use that for fishing in Russia
put that on a hook and..
- oh it's lovely / - this for you
this for me we go together
- like this?
- yes yes
i don't even know what no no no
switch because i don't mind / - no no no
i don't mind eating the worm but this
and try it with vinegar
this takes like chicken heart
no chicken liver
that's actually chicken intestine
I don't know what this..
i do not want know what this is
so one version is chicken intestine
the other is pork intestines
 
I'll stick with the chicken
i knew there was something wrong with
that
- try the pig intestines it's nice / - try it's nice very nice yeah
no this is actually okay this is
beautiful this is the look
try this now you know this is pig's
intestine
try it my god you know
let me try the worm so
- so which is better the pig or the
chicken? / -  none
but i'll give this another go it's not
bad it's soft it's got nice texture
but when you get that this dirty taste
maybe it's the vinegar
but it's it's you get a very bad
aftertaste to this
maybe because i found out this chick
pigs intestine
but at the start it's okay very nice
texture it's soft aftertaste is not nice
 
this tastes like paper this tastes like
okay at the start
but then no this
this is two both of them
- one for me / - a chicken no
um no so my my decision this is..
two and a half
i don't touch that but
that's two
this is two / - no this is one for me this
- is one
- this is one not zero?
and this is .5
do you know what until i knew
what it is
it wasn't even that bad but then when i
found out
i would eat it. it's not that bad
but i wouldn't go and buy this this is
what i'm saying
if i'm in the jungle or if
i'm lost in the desert no no that one no no
no no no
yeah if i was lost on some island or
something i would eat it but
yeah to survive that's what i mean yes
yes
this is not sickening this is this is
you can eat it
but i wouldn't go with my girlfriend and
say let's go buy
chicken worm or that whatever no no
every every foreigner who goes to the
philippines wants to try this
is that sugar? salt? / - salt
what do i do with this?
- i guess you break like
an egg? / - you peel it
so when you crack it there's soup in
it
you can put salt in it
and then after that you eat the inside
- when i go quiet it means i'm nervous /- I don't know if it's me
wait I think I want to go first
because then I will see you
and hmm no you go
no no go go
no you go first because you'll see me
and then you're going to be feeling sick
and it's hot inside
i would say it's alive inside
like this boom
not like i'm breaking an
egg but just a little bit
and then i remove? / - you don't know how to crack an egg? come on
no i crack like this boom / - at home, do you go like this?
no you go first
you first no / - together
you take one I'll take one
its a russian roulette
it's nice but i don't know what my lips
just touched
i don't know i don't want to know what
that is
what okay is this.. are we just
going to try the soup and this is that's it?
- no you have to get inside / - everything
it's like egg soup
egg soup?
- i guess because it tastes like egg but it's a soup
- have you eaten it before? 
- yeah
if you eat with us let's go
- come to the video
- okay let's go
he looks happy from this
no no wait the
brown one the brown one is good
this one's a mix of both
this one oh my god there is the the
thing the thing the liquid

okay tell me this am i gonna be sick
after this?
no no no no no no no
- am I gonna be ill after this?  
- no this is all protein yeah
a lot of protein
- this is all protein
- protein and fat
- i'm not
- hers is bigger
oh i'm the lucky one
you are the lucky one girl
we ate pigs intestine what can go worse than this
- Cheers
- Cheers
i think Diane is about to cry
what do you think?
guys this is five this is out of four
out of five this is the best one
really?
No
tastes like liver
but
just the fact that I knew what it is
made it worse but it wasn't that bad i
wouldn't say it was nice
it was definitely better than the snake
that i ate today but this one
yeah this was this is uh three
three because the look minus two
otherwise
it's nice if i had to blindfold i would
say it's it's it's liver yeah
but not because I knew what it is
I don't wanna know again
and funny fact: Angelo doesn't eat balut
I'm still biting its head
you're still eating the chicken's heart?
It doesn't taste that bad
i think because i put a lot of salt
ah okay so how would you rate this guys?
- two / - three three
no two for me
so since you've tasted that one this is
your reward
and of course you're still going to have
to like rate this one
- okay / - this is the mais con yelo
- this is the banana con yelo / - and this is what?
this is mais con yelo. So in english it's corn
it's made of like crushed ice, corn kennels
or banana slices and then sweetened milk
i hope you don't tell me at the end that
is again some chicken
- rice 
- chicken fruits and something
- is this rice again?
- no it's crushed ice
first impression sweet corn for me
is a vegetable i don't i would i don't
like it i wouldn't
eat sweet corn as dessert yeah really we
we eat a lot in brazil
with cakes no sweet greens sweet corn
for me is the same as cucumber would you
have cucumber in your dessert alone
yeah i don't know i've never had i never
had sweet corn in like
it's always in salads it's for me it's a
vegetable
it happens oh my god i like this
this is a weird mix we are today egg
that is still alive / - chicken intestines
 
i forgot about it
i actually forgot about the pigs intestines that I ate but it
brings back bad memories
this is three
not this not we can't compare it to the
egg because egg was also three
the reason this is three is too much ice
for me how do you eat it you you chew on
your eggs it's like ice cream
like you're just chilling talking i'm
not yeah
it's so hot in the philippines most of
our desserts are with like crushed ice
so it makes sense yeah
and there it makes sense yeah whose idea
was this to come here?
mine? oh no okay because
i'll never forget eating what i eat
today i know i know
you got on camera right you don't have
- it's on youtube
- i know
they better follow me i better
get ten thousand followers after this I swear
you have to put the link for my instagram
I swear
you will have a boyfriend soon he will say he's vegan
and when he finds this video that's it
love is over
but like this like you get
chunks of ice here
like okay i get i get the idea but this
is for me three
because the ice if you know the filipino
chef tell them
what is missing from here: rice
rice will make this dish perfect in
brazil we have something with
desserts with uh rice as well we call it
sweet uh
exactly something like mango sticky rice
something like that
three for me as well three yeah three
because too much ice
it's just the good stuff this looks like
the good stuff
so the orange on is called kutsinta
so it's made with
uh like a steamed rice or like rice
flour
- see? that was rice / - it's not coconut, it's rice
- and that one is pichi pichi so it's in the same group
of dessert families
- i can't say this is rice / - i can't say
this is rice this is
cheesecake / - yeah
so much better than halo halo let me
have this one
yeah 100%
oh this is.. is this
is this rice? 100%? nothing nothing
alive here
i like this better /- yeah this is nice
it's not that bad but no
- what is the fruit? i mean it's rice
- lemon
- lemon right?
- this is all rice?
so pichi pichi has a cassava tapioca
- do you know tapioca?
- we have tapioca in Brazil
- this is healthy
- right? it doesn't taste like..
carbs nice carbs good carbs no this is
nice okay
okay because we're sportsman
here i'm gonna change my mind i'm gonna
give this a four
four and the pancakes five okay
this this one is a bit tasteless no
something in there / - four ehh 3.7
no this is nice lemon
okay finish everything off this is
another dessert drink it's called sago't gulamat
so it's sweet and there's gelatine inside and tapioca
What's in the bottom? Chick peas? / - tapioca inside
there's nothing alive man
but this is tapioca?
no no what is in the bottom?
tapioca
is it gonna come through this?
this is 5
this is 5
the little jellyfish that come from the
bottom they're very sweet
whatever this is i don't know what this
is but this is lovely no
i changed mine 4.5 this is five
this is a bit too sweet ain't it?
and now the lady is to tell you that
this is chicken intestine or something
inside
okay tapioca peachy peachy gucci is all
good
but um my question will the chicken grow
inside my belly?
You'll see
You'll see in 9 months
