- It's like a whipped
cream salad (chuckles).
So we've just got a charcuterie board
without the bread, in essence.
(soft music)
Hi, I'm Beryl,
and the theme for
today's episode is salad.
And I know that for me,
when I think about salad,
I tend to think of a bowl of lettuce.
- [Group] Boo!
- We don't have a single bowl
of lettuce in this episode.
In fact, I would even venture to say
that the definition of salad,
when you think of it as
a bowl of leafy greens,
that's not the definition
you guys went with
when I asked for salad recipes.
In exciting news, though,
this episode has a sponsor.
The sponsor is Hamama Greens.
If you guys have seen my videos,
every time I add my pop of color,
I'm actually using their product.
I reached out to them,
because I've been using them for a while.
In essence, what it is,
is a seed quilt that you
can grow in your kitchen
in any sort of atmosphere.
It just needs water,
and you can grow your own
micro greens to put on salads
or on literally anything
and everything else,
as you have all called me out here.
And there are tons of
different types of micro greens
you can grow,
the radish ones, like I'm using today,
are kind of spicy.
And then you have sweeter ones.
You can do leafy greens.
It's a grab bag of fun.
I always thought about micro greens
as these kind of bougie things
that you would see in fancy restaurants,
and they were always so
expensive at the farmer's market.
So when I found this,
I was like, whoa, cool.
They gave me a link,
which I am putting in
the description below
if you wanna try them.
And honestly you should,
because it's just really fun.
And you can put pops of color
on anything and everything,
just like me (laughs).
Before we dive into the recipes
I wanna make sure that
we're all on the same page.
So here's my question.
What is a salad?
And here's the definition
that I'm going with:
a salad is a mixture of foods,
usually, including at least one vegetable,
it can be cold, room temperature or warm.
Pretty much a salad
can almost be anything,
which makes this episode
actually a lot more fun.
And in my research,
I found that there are kind
of these buckets of salad,
- [Women] Buckets of salads.
- So we have our leafy or green salad.
Then you have a fruit salad,
a bound salad,
which means that it's using mayonnaise
or something creamy as
a binding ingredient,
like a pasta salad or a potato salad.
There are dinner salads,
and there are dessert salads.
And we actually go through quite a lot
of these different salads in this episode,
so I hope that this will expand your view
of what a salad is and that
not all salads are healthy.
We will find this out in this episode.
Okay, let's start.
(cheery music)
- Hi, my name is Clara and I'm
from Barranquilla, Colombia.
And the dish I want to
share with you today
is called Ensalada de Payaso,
which means clown salad.
This name is kind of a joke,
because when you eat it,
you might stain your mouth,
so we call it clown salad.
The star of the dish is beet.
It also has carrots, onions, potatoes,
tomatoes, cilantro, lime, salt, and mayo.
And of course, to top, you
can have hard-boiled eggs.
I love the contrast of flavors
between this creaminess of the mayo,
and the sweet you get from the beet,
and the tang you get from the lime.
So it's like a perfect combination.
It's super fresh and it's super delicious,
especially at lunchtime.
The dish was actually popularized
by street vendors that go
around the city in bikes.
And they will serve them to
people who were at lunch breaks.
So they will eat it in the
shadow of an almond tree.
So it was a really nice
thing for people to have.
I really love this salad,
because it reminds me of the
nature of people from my city.
You can see the vibrant colors
and you can smell the culture.
You can taste the jokes,
you can see how joyous we are,
and how we view life.
And I really can't help but
smile every time I eat it.
So I really hope you smile too, and,
(speaking foreign language)
which means enjoy it, bye.
(bright music)
- So we're starting with
a Colombian bound salad,
as we learned when we were talking about
the definitions of salads.
I love that it was called a clown salad,
and the color is just so beautiful.
Beets just make everything pop.
Like, look at that color.
Pity this bites too big.
I mean, as much as I disparage myself
when I make a mayonnaise
salad, they taste so good.
It is really nice.
The pop a lime with the
creaminess of the mayo.
It's interesting because the tomato
is almost like the crunchiest
thing in the salad,
because you have a boiled potato,
boiled potate,
boiled potato.
What did I just say?
You have boiled beets,
potatoes and carrots.
So they all have quite
a soft kind of texture,
and then a crunchy cold tomato.
I'm gonna have it with the egg.
Whew, cold salad, warm egg.
That was nice.
How about the description
of eating the salad
under the shade of an almond tree?
I don't think I've ever even been
in the presence of an almond tree.
I would love to eat this
under the shade of one though.
Is my mouth stained?
There's no way for me to
know if I look like a clown.
I don't feel like one.
This was a good start.
I don't feel healthy,
but it definitely feels different
from when I was eating
French fries (chuckles).
(cheerful music)
- Hi, everyone.
My name is Natalia and I'm from Mexico.
The dish I want to share with you today
is called Ensalada de Nopales.
The solid is very simple and healthy.
The main ingredients are nopales,
tomato, salt, cilantro,
olive oil and oregano.
Nopales are a very popular
vegetable here in Mexico.
We use them in many recipe.
They are part of culture
since our ancestors.
They look like a kind of cactus.
The flavor is kind of salty
and it tastes like lemon.
We usually eat this salad as a
garnish in meat, beans, rice,
and other traditional Mexican dishes
as barbacoa, mixiotes, and carnitas.
I love this dish because it
reminds me of my grandma.
She always makes this salad
and it's so delicious.
And also I think it's
a very interesting way
to join our Mexican culture in one fish.
So I hope you like and buen provecho.
(cheerful music)
I love nopales.
I was really excited when
I saw the salad submitted,
and I was immediately, like,
"Yes, I wanna eat that."
Nopales, I was not able
to find fresh ones,
but the ones that you can get in a jar
or in a can definitely work.
You don't need to start with fresh.
But if you can, obviously,
I'm sure it tastes better.
These I just got at a
tiny Mexican grocery store
near my house, yum.
(bouncy music)
I think the texture of
them is so, so satisfying.
They're crunchy and soft at the same time.
Kind of like...
Well, I don't know what to
compare it to, actually.
No, I don't know.
Nopales is definitely one of those
quintessential Mexican ingredients,
when you think about like
what is an ingredient
that really makes you
think about a country.
Nopales is that for me, from Mexico.
If you wanted to make Mexican
food at home one night,
I would absolutely recommend adding this.
It is super simple to make.
You just need to find the nopales.
And like I said, you can get
them in a can or in a jar,
and then just add like tomatoes,
bada bing, bada boom, bada nopales.
All right, next salad.
(bright jazz music)
- Hi, everyone, my name
is Anastasia Romanov,
and I'm Russian,
but I live in Slovenia.
And today I wanna tell you about the dish
that makes me think of home.
The dish is called Selyodka Pod Shuboy,
or in English, dressed herring.
It's not that old of a dish,
because it comes from the 1960s
from the times of the USSR.
From the beginning of
the creation of the dish,
it was actually more like a salad,
because the ingredients were mixed.
But now it's more like a salad cake,
since it consists of multiple layers.
These layers can be from
potato, then carrot,
onion, beet root, egg.
But the most important
ingredient is herring,
which is usually as the
bottom or the second layer
of this cake salad.
And in between the layers, you
smother them with mayonnaise,
and also on top of the salad
gate when you're finished,
then you can also garnish it with dough
for aesthetic purposes.
I believe that the Selyodka Pod Shuboy
is one of the most
infamous salads of Russia.
We serve it at New Year's Eve,
family and friend visits,
other celebratory occasions.
And I think it just
represents Russia the most.
It's so fatty, heartwarming,
and spreads so much love.
(cheery music)
- Salad cake (laughs).
We love to see this.
I am not a huge fan of herring.
Oh.
The herring is actually...
- I mean, it's still strong.
It's not my favorite fish,
but it's actually balanced
really well in this.
Mayonnaise will do that.
To be a truly authentic Russian salad,
I probably could've added
a bit more mayonnaise.
Okay, and I did not realize this
when I was choosing the salads,
that this salad is, in essence,
the Colombian clown salad.
The only addition really is the herring.
And how wild is that?
You know, you have these two countries,
completely different,
totally different countries.
And here we have, in
essence, the same salad.
I think, like, that is
one of the cool things
about doing this series
of seeing different interpretations
that nobody would've
ever been like, oh yeah,
I imagine that Columbia and
Russia had very similar salads.
Like the presentation
is different, obviously,
but the ingredients were the same.
I thought that was so cool.
I thought that was so cool.
I think that of the two, I
prefer the Colombian one,
and that's mostly just because of herring.
I obviously struggled
getting this out of the bowl.
The side view, it left
a bit to be desired.
You know, I don't have
an excuse for myself.
I'm just not that talented.
I did suffer an injury making the salad,
Grating everything on
my like cheese grater,
I got a little bit of skin.
That was not fun,
and it hurt to cook for the rest of that.
And even still, my knuckle hurts.
My poor knuckle.
For someone who claimed
they didn't really like
the herring that much,
I did a great job finishing
my dish (chuckles).
(soft music)
- Hi, everyone.
I'm Sebastian from Columbia,
but I live in the city
of Basel in Switzerland
since 13 years.
The dish I want to share with you
is called in German, Wurstsalat.
Wurst means sausage.
For this salad, you need
a sausage called servelat,
which is a precooked
sausage, some pickles,
a hard cheese like Emmental or Gruyere,
chopped onions, a
vinaigrette with mustard,
and some chives and herbs you like.
This is a very satisfying salad,
so it is considered to be a main dish
that you can eat the whole year.
It is very rich and salty,
and it's great to eat with a nice beer.
I liked it very much,
because it was the first dish that I tried
in a Swiss restaurant.
And it reminds me of
my years as a student.
It is a very beloved dish
in whole Switzerland,
because it has two very
typical ingredients
from here that Swiss people are proud of,
cheese and sausage.
I hope you like it.
And how we say in the
German part of Switzerland,
(speaking foreign language)
which means enjoy.
(bright jazz music)
- I'm calling this one a dinner salad,
because it seems like a dinner salad.
So we've just got a charcuterie board
without the bread, in essence.
But I think I'll like it
because I love pickles.
Ooh, it's good.
I'm like acting surprised.
I like pickles with peanut butter.
I knew I was gonna fricking love this.
I like them on pizza.
The pickles are crunchy.
Why are they still crunchy?
Why wouldn't I like them in a salad?
Okay, the white onions in this...
I wanted to confirm,
but I feel like the white onions
have been slightly pickled
from the dressing,
and the dressing is so good.
You know, there is a
link in the description
with all of the recipes,
which has the full dressing,
but it was like vinegar and pickle juice,
some sugar, salt, mustard.
It was like...
I mean, it's really, really nice.
It's a really nice salad dressing.
And I feel like this salad kind of...
It feels like a picnic salad,
like a salad where I should
be in the Swiss Alps,
like on a big blanket,
and someone's like, "Oh,
Beryl, I brought Wurstsalat."
And I'd be like, "Oh, one
of my favorites, thank you."
I need to leave New York City.
(Beryl cries)
(Beryl laughs)
I really like it.
Like, I really like it.
I really, really like it.
The last salad is the dessert salad,
which I'm pretty excited about trying.
Okay.
(cheerful orchestral music)
- Hey, Beryl. Hey, internet.
My name is Denty from the Philippines,
and I'm here to talk a
bit about the Buko salad.
Buko salad is the Filipino
version of fruit salad
with Buko or the flesh of a young coconut
as its main ingredients.
Coconuts are ubiquitous
here in the Philippines,
as well as other neighboring
Southeast Asian countries.
And I feel like we've
managed to incorporate it.
in a lot of our dishes and desserts here,
and Buko salad is one of
the most well-known ones.
I've also read somewhere that this dish
might date back to when
the Americans were here
in the early part of the 20th century,
back when we were first
introduced to canned goods.
So the Buko is combined with
a bunch of other fruits.
We usually use the canned
tropical fruit cocktails
that are widely available
in the supermarket here.
And then we mix in an
all-purpose cream concoction,
a condensed milk to
blend everything together
into this creamy, yet refreshing treat.
Then we leave it in the
fridge for a few hours,
because it's best when chilled.
So it is beloved by Filipino households.
And this can be served
during parties and fiestas,
or, you know, when you just
feel like whipping up a batch
on a very hot afternoon.
(uplifting music)
- Final salad, a dessert salad.
And I don't even know...
I don't have any expectations,
because so many of the ingredients
in this salad I had never
even heard of before.
What?
It's like a whipped
cream salad (chuckles).
It's sweet.
But the fruit is like,
it helps kind of balance that.
Whoa.
Okay, I'm gonna try this jelly,
this coconut jelly.
Oh!
Mmm, I get these in my bubble teas.
Oh, I didn't realize that's what it was.
The heavy table cream,
I'm still kind of
confused as to what it is.
Like it's not whipped cream,
because it's super thick,
but it wasn't heavy cream
'cause it wasn't a liquid.
I don't know.
But when I tasted it on
its own, I was like, woo,
get some LACTAID ready, you know?
I feel like definitely
the idea of having this
at a party checks out.
Like sitting alone in my living room,
maybe not quite the vibe.
However, I could see
myself standing around
holding a bowl, chatting to some people
in a backyard barbecue,
being like, "Hey, how's the family?
Everybody good?"
So that wraps up this episode of salads.
However, I do have a couple
other salad submissions.
So I'm gonna make a part two.
I do need a few more, so leave a comment
if there's another
salad that I should add.
Spoiler alert, I do
have Indonesia already.
So you guys are covered.
With that, big thank you to the sponsor,
and I will see you all in my next video.
Bye.
