that means the sun is super strong at the moment
but then luckily I have my long sleeve otherwise 
uh I might get sunburned actually yesterday if you  
saw the previous episode I was riding without the 
sleeves and it was a cloudy day not really sunny  
so I thought it's going to be all right do we 
have to pay parking here uh no I don't think so  
um so yesterday I was riding without the sleeves 
and in the evening my arms were a little bit red  
I'm not really that used to 
the strong Sun here yet oh

thank you
let me tell you one fun fact in Germany 
it's a sin to drink beer with ice  
I know in Asia it's very common that you mix 
beer with ice but still are seeing that as a  
German is unusual but actually I like it as well 
especially in hot water drinking beer with ice  
cream it's so yummy oh ice cream here yes you 
want it you want to oh yeah sure sure oh yeah  
they offered me some ice cream here you call it 
dirty ice cream right yes oh yeah yeah I heard  
about that before they call it dirty ice cream but 
it's not really dirty of course what flavor is it  
oh thank you so much so much oh thank you so this 
is mango and cheese I never had ice cream with  
cheese before oh it's not good yes that's very 
good thank you so much all right let's check out  
their water here they just told me that if you 
are lucky you can see some some fishy actually
oh yeah I see some some small fishes here 
already oh and I have to say the water is a very  
refreshing it's not too cold actually a little 
bit warm so the perfect condition I would say  
ah oh yeah what could be better a hot sunny day 
here in the Philippines if you have a nice Beach  
here Clear Water refreshing friendly locals they 
also just offered me beer which would be nice  
actually to have a have a little beer here but uh 
yeah I'm driving still not at my destination today  
I see some people actually 
snorkeling here let's have a look  
if there's something to see or what they are
so I'm not sure if you can 
see it on the camera but  
nothing around here so it's actually like half 
an hour later now spend some time here talking  
with the locals enjoying the Sun the water to 
show you a little bit around so we have locals  
playing volleyball here we have the beautiful palm 
trees here I mean look at this here that looks  
like this is the Philippines right trees like 
this a nice Beach blue water in the background

or actually a little bit more of a draw or  
something like that you know had some fun time 
chatting with the locals they were very kind  
and it's always nice to uh yeah get to 
know people from a different culture so
