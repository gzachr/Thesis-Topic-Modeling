hi fellow travelers so today gonna 
do something fun i want to travel  
and unfortunately i can't 
travel far we're both traveling  
in fact we are going to travel a little 
bit to her home country for supper
so we are on our way to go get 
some philippine food for supper  
and i don't want to tell you where because i want 
to make you watch a little bit because if i tell  
you everything now you're going to quit watching 
the video and that doesn't do me any good so  
so since i'm not telling you where i'm going just 
yet i am going to tell you that i'd really like  
it if you click that subscribe button and 
the like button and the bell notification  
even leave a comment because comments are fun to 
read and i read them i generally respond to them  
she reads them she's not so good at 
responding to them though she makes me do it
so we're heading out come on for the drive
guess where we're going for supper
so it's still a pandemic we still have to 
wear face masks we've already ordered the food  
it's going to be ready in two minutes 
apparently so let's go inside and check this out
ready to come along excited
excited palmore people sitting inside 
so it's not a full-on epidemic pandemic
i'll stay here
we got a whole bunch of food from jollibees 
we've got some pineapple drink some food  
there another bag over there we're gonna take it 
home and we're gonna show you what's all there
so made it home with jollibee's food and 
i bet you're wondering what's in there  
we're gonna do an unboxing or in this case 
an unbagging of jollibee's food so this is a  
pretty exciting moment first of all jollibees 
has the best drink that's pineapple juice  
i think they call it pineapple puncher 
so here we go tada drum roll please oops
we have spicy chicken spicy chicken 
little flags to tell you that it's spicy
we have
jollibee spaghetti
no no burger steak where's the rice  
oh they're in a little bit we'll get 
burger steak mostly with rice we have
peach mango pie which are really tasty
and you thought that was everything but 
you obviously saw there was another bag so
another bucket of chicken but this is 
regular chicken no no little flags and
we have rice we'll explain that one in a second
this is gravy so in the philippines it's it's 
traditional to dip your chicken in gravy not  
we don't do that here in canada but that's 
a very philippine thing is this extra sauce  
yeah i'm gonna explain that one in a second extra 
sauce to go with the jolly spaghetti there you go
tada someone loves jelly spaghetti not not  
we're not pointing fingers at anybody but somebody 
does not like jaw to be spaghetti so that's it you  
want to have a have a bite with us we're going 
to sit down and eat now so this is what the  
burger steak looks like with rice and a 
piece of chicken and this jolly spaghetti  
and some chicken with a little flag on it it says 
spicy spicy this is a jolla bees meal enjoy eating
so the best part to jollibee's a peach mango 
pie it's got peach and something else um would  
you say i mean mango in a pie it's very yummy 
i would recommend even if you don't go for the  
really excellent chicken you gotta go for the 
peach mango pie like oh someone's taking a bite  
no don't hide it don't hide it let's see you're 
inside your peach mango pie mmm peachy and mangoey  
so there you have it a peach mango pie see if 
i can do this one-handed cheap jollibees are so  
thoughtful they make it convenient for someone 
to vlog and take out a pie at the same time
here you go have a bite
now i'm hands-free
