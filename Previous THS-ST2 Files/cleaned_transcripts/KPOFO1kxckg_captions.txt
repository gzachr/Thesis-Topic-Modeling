which filipino snacks are good to send
in the mail last weekend i went to my
local filipino store and bought a bunch
of snacks to send to my new foodie
friends that i met online
i'm so grateful for social media because
i'm able to meet new friends through my
phone
they're also fellow food creators so i
got a sense of what types of food they
like to enjoy
and i kept that in mind when picking
their snacks how i pick snacks
are a combination of which filipino
snacks i like and which snacks i know my
friends and family have liked in the
past
i like to mix in some snacks that i know
they'd like for sure
and snacks with flavors that they may
not be familiar with and
i really enjoy giving people new food
experiences so that they can at least
say they've tried it i also wanted to
send them something you can't get at the
store so i baked them my ube pandan and
corn cheese cookies
ugh i can't wait to meet them in person
one day and treat my new friends to
freshly made filipino food and snacks
till then i hope these snacks can hold
them off if you're curious about any of
these snacks i'll be making videos to
share what they look and taste like
stay tuned
