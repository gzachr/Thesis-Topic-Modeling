the bathroom we have the bathroom here we  
have shower here we have a mirror and a sink 
and we have a toilet we have some towels here  
and some soap and other toiletries a bit of review 
of this bathroom apparently I need not really  
liking it that much look at this black stuffs 
here okay I don't know if that's a mold or what  
dirt they could have cleaned that but they put 
like a silicone thingy here already instead of  
cleaning it first of removing all of those 
black stops before putting the silicon and  
look at this one yeah it's old but they could maintain it and the showerhead  
that's very bad very bad showerhead you could 
have scrub it read it then here on the left side  
we have a cabinet for clothes and all of that 
then it's the actual room so we have a bed here  
with a baby baby doesn't come in all rooms and 
in all beds but it comes in this one we have a  
baby trolley same it doesn't come in all the 
rooms but it comes in this one then we have a  
TV here on this side and some things for drinks 
go for teas coffee we have a fridge yeah then  
you have a chair here in the outside we have a 
sofa a small outdoor sofa and a table and this  
is the view from the room view from the room as 
well here let's take you outside now and show  
you outside the balcony this is the balcony so these 
are actually villas on the water I got some there

this was the room tour the short room tour of 
the villa in Apulit Resort the room looks good  
it's not new but it looks good it's cleaned 
and the view is very nice the waters are like  
turquoise color the first impression is not 
the resort is the boat they bring you from  
the mainland the boat actually it's very 
small currently and I'd like the baby and  
the trolley and they were like so many guests 
and we are all crammed inside there in a small  
boat like sardines such a big hotel to have 
such a small boat and cram all their guests  
inside there I think this resort can afford 
a bigger boat so yeah this is the end of the  
tour the room tour we hope you enjoyed and 
we'll show you around the resort this is  
the bedroom from the bath you can see this some 
islands they're far away this is the porch view
