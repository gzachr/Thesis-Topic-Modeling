- In January of 2013, I traveled out
to Tacloban, Philippines for
the first time in my life.
I just arrived to (indistinct), Tacloban.
My purpose was to meet relatives
and to research my family heritage.
(taut music)
And so I did.
I met with supposed relatives
who shared my family name.
(taut music)
I also did family research
while I was there,
although at every stop, the records
did not date far enough back
to provide me with the answers I needed.
The relatives showed me
around to see the landmarks
and the beautiful places in Tacloban.
(mellow music)
I headed home to Los
Angeles with little leads
but more familiarity for this
beautiful land of mystery,
which seemed to be a hub
of history for my family.
I related so much to General
MacArthur's famous statement,
"I shall return."
We are at the MacArthur statue.
Especially so since Tacloban was the place
he did return in World War II.
(taut music)
(raindrops pouring)
In November of 2013,
news hit that the strongest typhoon
that would ever make landfall
was headed for Tacloban.
(anxious music)
The super typhoon was named Haiyan,
also known as Yolanda in the Philippines.
We saw extreme images on the news
and prayed that our relatives were okay.
I couldn't believe that
some of the news footage
was shot from the very hotel
that I stayed during my visit.
(anxious music)
I heard through social
media that our family
had close calls, but thank the Lord
everyone made it out of the storm alive.
In December of 2015,
I headed back to Tacloban
to join my brother, Caleb,
and his girlfriend, Jessica.
(bright music)
It wasn't until we
arrived that we understood
the true devastation of the typhoon,
and how close of a call
some of my family had.
Hello, how are you?
- We are coping.
- [Luke] My relative, Rebecca,
picked me up from the airport.
As our trip went on, she began to reveal
her breathtaking typhoon experience to us.
This arena, didn't they use it as a-
- [Rebecca] Yes, an evacuation center and-
- [Luke] But then it flooded, right?
- [Rebecca] Yes, the
water was up to that brim.
Everything by this side
was destroyed, Luke.
- [Luke] Look at the water damage
all the way up to beyond the roof.
(anxious music)
That's what nobody expected
was the storm surge.
- [Rebecca] Yes, because
before Yolanda struck,
the weather was like this, it was fine.
Three weeks prior to the typhoon,
Gil was having a shortness of breath.
- [Luke] Yeah, yeah.
- So we decided not to move
because Tacloban is near hospitals
and if the storm came, we could leave if,
and there was no ride available,
we could just walk to the hospital.
This used to be a big, beautiful house,
but now it's roofless.
(taut music)
This is from my work.
I didn't use it because I was
reserving it for something,
some kind of a souvenir from my work.
(taut music)
We started running to the second floor.
Our things were all floating.
- Oh yeah?
- Yeah!
They were running after us, (indistinct).
(taut music)
This is the place where
I saved some stuff,
because the water started to subside
when it was already here.
- [Luke] So you put it in there?
- Yeah.
- Just to keep it dry?
(pensive music)
- [Rebecca] Because of
the strength of the water,
we ran up there.
This is where we saved ourselves.
Here, this portion here.
We were about 15 people here.
- Wow.
- Yeah.
And the rain was so hard.
And you know that this
building was shaking.
When the water was up,
and the rain was so hard,
the building was shaking.
I thought this building
would be destroyed.
And I was looking at this.
I said, if the building will be destroyed,
we will hold on to this (laughing).
- [Luke] And then what
did the ocean look like?
- [Rebecca] Everywhere was water.
Everything was destroyed.
And the people there who did not evacuate,
they all died.
My gosh.
- [Luke] How long were you up here?
- About three hours.
- Wow.
- About three hours.
- [Luke] Until the water subsided?
- And we thought it would never subside.
- [Luke] Wow.
- We thought it will
just keep on coming up.
And you know, my neighbors, they evacuated
when the water was already up here.
And so they had to climb the gate
and they had to negotiate the grills.
And those grills were designed
to keep burglars away,
and they were something like, you know,
it was a little sharp.
Those were the grills
that I was telling you.
They sustained certain
wounds in their skin
and in their body.
- [Luke] But as long as they're alive,
that's what matters, you know?
- Yeah, then the water
subsided at about 11,
and it subsided so fast,
but the wind, it was still strong.
The wind was still strong,
and we could not go down
until two o'clock in the afternoon,
because, you know, you
will be blown by the wind.
(chuckles) You'll be blown by the wind.
And it was slippery all over.
There was a store on the
other side of the street,
and she had rice, they had soft drinks,
and they started doing the (indistinct),
so they will survive.
We didn't have anything.
We were having breakfast then
when the storm was
already starting to grow.
- [Luke] So what did you
do for the next few days?
- At about 3:00 p.m., about 2:00 p.m.
we started walking towards DNG,
towards my parents' house,
and it took us about three hours.
- [Luke] Oh, and they have
food and everything there?
- We left three here,
and then on the street,
we saw some bananas, somebody
was selling some bananas.
And so I bought it for 50 pesos a bunch.
And I bought three, I bought it for 150.
Oh my goodness, these are
pictures of (indistinct).
Oh, my goodness, childhood pictures.
- [Luke] So, these things
you carried up just to save?
- Yeah, but you know,
the water destroyed them.
It was such a mess.
(children wailing)
(pensive music)
- [Luke] In the end, Typhoon
Haiyan, also known as Yolanda,
was the most fatal storm in
the history of the Philippines
with over 6,000 lives lost.
(pensive music)
There are plenty of scars that remain
from the storm on so many levels.
You know, the roofs that
are gone over there,
is that all from the typhoon?
- [Rebecca] Yes, this is the hospital.
- And so much that will never be forgotten
from this horrific typhoon.
(pensive music)
And there's a restaurant that I went to
before the storm, and it's gone.
(pensive music)
Whose car?
- [Rebecca] That's mine,
that's the car that we used
when you came over the last time.
- We're at the Leyte Park Resort,
and this is where a storm
chaser and videographer,
Jim Edds, recorded some
pretty incredible footage
of just the power and
intensity of the typhoon.
You can still see almost
everything has gone under water.
(pensive music)
Yeah, this boat washed
ashore during the typhoon.
back in November 2013,
which, it was the full boat.
They had to make a memorial out of it,
just to allow enough space,
but the full boat was the original.
(mellow music)
Yeah, it just shows you
the power of the storm,
that the water was high
enough to wash a ship
over all these houses to land here.
(taut music)
Although the people here have
shown how amazing they can be
at dusting themselves
off and bouncing back,
standing up strong and showing us all
how they have a reason to be merry.
(taut music)
Although just over two years had passed,
I was amazed at how well
the city had recovered.
Support poured in from
throughout the world.
(taut music)
During our visit, we learned a lot
from what we witnessed here.
(taut music)
Most of all, we know that
the people of Tacloban
and the surrounding areas affected,
will not let a super storm
ever put a stop to their happiness.
(taut music)
That's such an incredible example
for us all to learn from
these amazing people.
(taut music)
No matter how great the storm,
there will always be brighter days ahead.
(taut music)
