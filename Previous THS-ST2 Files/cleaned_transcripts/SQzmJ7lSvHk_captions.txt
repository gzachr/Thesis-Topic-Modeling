good afternoon my friends and welcome back to 
another video here in the beautiful country  
of the Philippines guys and in today's video 
we're actually now over in Makati so it's my  
first time exploring this area and we're going 
to be taking you with us we're actually only in  
Makati for a few moments because this is where 
I'm staying but we're heading over towards BGC  
so we're gonna be walking I think probably part 
of the way and then after that I'll probably hop  
in a cab hop in Tuktuk something like that, we shall see 
what happens at this point we're just going with  
today's adventure so let's get into it and head 
over this way. So guys I'm doing the walk is 
At least partially the way from Makati over to BGC 
number one because I want to see what this city is  
like or like these two cities are like and number 
two it is rush hour so I guess this street right  
here is pretty fast moving at the moment but the 
street that I just came off uh was like so crowded  
I was actually walking faster than the traffic 
so yeah I figured I'm gonna walk part of the way  
see what we can see and I can tell you like 
this part of like the greater Manila area is  
so modern all of the architecture and generally 
you're not going to find as much like street  
food in these areas there's probably like some 
sort of ordinances so they're not allowed to be  
you know like all over this area that's why 
you know you kind of just see people walking  
in this area and a bunch of different like 
corporate buildings and so you know it's a  
Different twist to the area one thing I can tell 
you can find it everywhere in this city is 7-Elevens  
literally, since I started walking I wasn't 
filming all of it I have seen like 20 of them.  
So as you guys can see I'm making some pretty 
good progress to get over to BGC at about
4:20 p.m so the sun's gonna be setting here in probably 
like 45 minutes so we'll get to see a bit but uh  
yeah it's just a really nice walk because you know 
like it's just a different feel after spending a  
lot of time already so far in the greater Manila 
area it's like it's crazy you can go I think this  
area is like 30 minutes away from where I was 
staying before and get a completely different  
experience overall a lot more like highways and 
infrastructure in this area and as you can see  
the streets are very clean here you can't find 
that much trash and litter uh you know a couple  
pieces here and there but aside from that just 
a really clean area yeah guys it's great that  
they have these uh stairwells that brings us 
across because I was like how the heck am I  
going to get across this street across that like 
gas station area I was like there's no way I'm  
able to cross that street but here it goes we've 
got a nice escalator to bring us up to the top  
we're making good timing hopefully we'll make it 
there before the sun goes down though we shall see
okay long your dancer all right now 
we're going this way crossing over
Roderick francaise all right the man yes nice 
to meet you brother okay so it looks like that's  
the way we get across right down here and that 
should get us there this is a busy spot over here
let's see
all right so those are all the locals are
guys it's gonna be a long walk still 
we've got 30 minutes to get there
the question is how do we get to uh how 
do we get to the other side of the street
thank you very much hey there 
he is see you later brother
oh yeah this is confusing guys once you 
take it once or twice you learn it but  
I walked all the way over there got stuck at 
the buses and there's actually another bridge  
to get across the next set of lanes right over 
here and that's how we're gonna get over there  
so it's nice to have the pedestrian 
crosswalks but yeah it's confusing
yeah okay long perfect and let's see 
here all right now we're making the  
the progress we're looking for one last cross 
a ticketing office so there's a Metro here  
I wonder if we can take the metro to BGC 
hello brother does this Metro go to BGC
okay so it's yeah correct 
all right perfect thank you
all right so we got to get the BGC from here
uh I need to go to BGC
11, 12, 13. oh 13 on the dot 
yeah it's in my backpack
okay
oh there we go
and which side do I go for 
uh BGC which side for BGC
next station salamat
all right guys there's definitely one thing 
that I do not like is that I'm triple vax and  
I still need to wear a mask just in the Metro 
station but hey it is what it is all right this  
is where we're going hey brother uh which 
side is a BGC left side on the right side
all right so we're getting on the 
train for our second time ever and  
I'm guessing it's this one 
the BGC who needs I don't know
do this side or this side like BGC area
all right well we found it so it's going to 
be this side I think one station and then  
we're there not sure how often these come but 
uh pretty often I'm assuming at rush hour all  
right we got the Metro coming right here 
so we waited about two three minutes and  
it is here wow it's gonna be a busy one as you 
can see so many people are on the Metro today
I think we're going just one 
stop though but it is air  
conditioning like air conditioned I hope 
we shall find out here real soon though
this is rush hour on the train well
all right that's going to be a tight one 
as you can see here we got room oh sorry  
all right it's gonna be one of the 
most packed metros I've been on  
but it is AC though so we can cool 
down kamosa coil oh all right bro  
all right so I think we're going just one one stop 
is a BGC the next stop, BGC the next stop
this is the next one yeah
okay it's quite quiet on the Metros
this isn't the BGC no the other way okay all 
right thank you very much I appreciate you  
letting me know well I don't know why our friend 
that we met told me to get on this one then
we get a few moments to cool off 
on the Metro so that's not too bad
my GPS even knows we're going the wrong way
let's turn that off here okay
yeah yeah guys probably the simpler solution would 
have been to just put in BGC into Google Maps  
but it is more fun to figure it out without 
using the map sometime too oh yeah the walk-in  
time's definitely increasing all right 
so it looks like right here in the Metro
recommended route
so it looks like this brought us right 
to Guadalupe it looks like a cool area
okay so we're gonna the way we came  
all right how was surprised like I I know everyone 
here speaks English and only one out of like 200  
people replied on how to get there but that's okay 
probably uh a bit awkward when we're all super  
directions maybe but here we go now we gotta 
get to the other side hop on that station and  
then do the process all over again so here we go 
good oh I think I gotta put this one in a single  
Journey ticket right there oh good and now we're 
good guys I would recommend if you're going to  
be taking the metro a lot when you're exploring 
the Philippines definitely get a multi-use card  
because if you don't have a multi-use card then 
you'll have to stand in line every single time  
to get a ticket which can be a pain you know but 
uh that's all right I think this is going to get  
us to the metro station on the other side 
I think or maybe we're going the wrong way  
okay all right let's check this out Metro 
Station all right wow that's the traffic  
guys that's why they want to take the metro at 
this hour that is insane and I'm assuming this  
is going to be the way down to the other side 
of the Metro so we can retrace our steps back
can I get a BGC uh bonaficio BGC bonafricio oh
um
oh perfect okay [__] thank you
oh right there yeah
okay Salama thank you very much for your help
we've got the let's see here check 
this one yeah all right all right  
all right don't worry I'm a vlogger not a 
threat yes sir yes ma'am thank you so much
all right guys we'll see you at Ayala  
oh okay there's a female only section over 
here so I guess this is the one we gotta hop on  
so it seems like only going in the uh Direction 
the other way the wrong way that I went  
that's when it's busy people are very shy 
on the Metro here but uh we're heading back  
this way guys I think we're taking it to 
Ayala I don't know why the guy before gave  
me the direction to go this way I probably 
didn't understand that I said BGC but it's uh  
we're gonna get there hopefully before 
the sun sets but the good news is we  
got some time to be in the air con which 
is quite nice because I'm sweating after  
being in the Manila humidity as you can see 
we can see a nice view of the City from here
yeah definitely a much more modern side especially 
comparing it to where I stayed the first first  
week or so in the Chinatown area all right I think 
we have made it to the stop we meant to get off  
for like 25 minutes waiting I am here there's 
like a bus or something to get to BGC so we shall  
see how this is possible it looks like this 
is the exit station we're going this way and  
right out this way
after you sir thank you that's my 
pleasure no it doesn't work oh okay
all right we've hit a bottleneck
all right now the question is where to from 
here probably one Ayala might be the way oh  
we got Subway eat fresh Brave when you walk out 
it seems like that's the only option that's open  
at this time bus base so if we are going to 
take a bus that's got to be the way to do it  
now it depends if it's a short walk to get to 
BGC from here which I'm going to check on the  
maps then I'm going to do the walk just because 
I like walking but if it's a long walk still  
I am definitely going to be taking 
the bus just to get that experience  
Okay so bus station to BGC this way 
yeah okay hey loose okay salamat panty
all right Northbound exit so this is the one I 
should have planned ahead should have left the  
apartment like two hours earlier if under the uh 
Transportation Logistics were gonna be a little  
more complex but uh hey that's all part of the fun 
adventure yeah that was definitely a bad decision  
I should have walked from where I was at then 
rather than taking the metro because the Metro  
someone gave me the wrong directions went the 
wrong way and then now where it just dropped me  
off unless I take the bus it's a 41 minute walk so 
well that's the fun in it right that makes it easy  
it says BGC bus so that's definitely got to be 
the bus all right hope we can make it on this one  
I'm not sure what the cost is but we shall 
see I guess we walk down this way to get on  
no idea okay well people are running makes me 
feel like I should be running if we want to  
get on this BGC Rider good well oh crap what do I 
do if I don't have a card uh do you know if I can  
pay on the bus can I pay uh on the bus over here 
okay all right so the third ticket of the trip
20. okay well we got 20 in 
coins so that should be doable  
hello can I have a single 
ride to BGC please [Applause]
okay thank you oh that's okay it's all about 
all right we got the ticket single ride for  
13 pesos so that comes out to uh all right 
let's stick that thing right there and oh  
QR all right okay salomat all right which 
one's the faster one yes sir where are you  
going uh BGC where's the best place to go where 
should I get off for the best place in BGC
yeah okay all right well we're just going to take 
this one I don't know how many stops we'll take  
but we'll just get off where it looks interesting 
all right found the BGC bus it looks like two  
of them arrive at once probably because there's 
just that much traffic and I'm guessing they're  
probably two separate routes that's purely a guess 
but uh yeah we're gonna take this go a few stops  
and wherever it looks interesting I'll watch on 
the map and then we'll hop off all right we're  
getting on the bus here so that was the nice part 
since we're number three in line we've got a lot  
of options for seats probably switch one close 
to the door so we can get on and off easily kuya  
right that was the longest journey to get down 
here of my life one hour and 40 minutes from  
Makati to BGC so well now we know rush hour is 
not the time to be uh traveling to this area  
but aside from that we made it and as you 
probably guessed I didn't record on the  
bus because I was pretty packed and we were 
sitting there for so long in traffic guys  
there was nothing even entertaining to show you 
but uh yeah now we're here this is literally a  
completely other version of Manila this reminds 
me of like Chicago right now I mean just from  
this perspective obviously like uh I'd mean 
that by like the uh civil design of this area  
the massive condo and apartment skyscrapers and 
just like you know thought put into everything in  
terms of the designs and restaurants really nice 
restaurants all over here guys I did want to show  
you this place during the day in this video but 
it is cool to see it at uh night because you can  
see like every once in a while you'll see some 
lights flash through here and it almost looks  
like they're in sync with the other buildings 
wait for it so you see a flash down there  
another stopping huh wow I was just walking 
guys and I pulled my camera out now they stopped  
we're gonna keep an eye out for it that's 
Shangri-La though that's a uh incredibly  
nice hotel like Ultra Luxury in this area okay so 
you can see a couple lights just going through and  
it literally looks like they're all in sync with 
the buildings like a light's going through all of  
them it's pretty awesome to see that you guys so 
we're gonna be coming up to uh High Street which  
is like the most well-known part of the BGC area 
so many shops and restaurants and I'm not even  
sure what else we're gonna find the downside is 
we're not showing you it during the day but uh  
don't worry we'll be back and we will definitely 
show you what it's like during the day as well  
okay so yeah you can see that how popular of a 
place it is Bonifacio High Street right there  
and it looks like there's all types of 
what is it shops and markets down there  
we'll take a little stroll down 
there and see what we can find
all right well we've got some Brands we 
recognize like Jamba Juice down there  
so we're walking through some like uh sculpted 
plants getting down here and there's tents up  
for something I'm not entirely certain what seems 
like some sort of event oh yeah this is the high  
end area we've got the Rolex shops right up there 
and just quite a mix of uh stuff Adidas shops  
on the left Shake Shack an absolute classic and 
it looks like a huge oh we got some little cats  
wins you guys so I walked down a little bit 
and we are going to find ourselves something  
delicious to eat I figured before I continue 
showing you this place I gotta get some food  
in my stomach because I am fading my friends I 
am fading it was such a long ride to get here  
that like you know when you're just like 
sitting there in traffic for so long it  
just totally takes all your energy that's how I 
feel right now so I'm thinking I'm gonna have to  
try a little pizza from Manila this looks 
like the spot oh it's closed oh it's open
uh you got pizza here and you're open oh 
we're already consumed oh you're closed  
yes for the day yes what time did you 
close at I work close at 6:30 until close
6:23 so I missed the pizza 
by 23 minutes that's a bummer
can I order and get it 
delivered outside of the door  
no oh that's a bummer all 
right thank you yes thank you
well the bad news is we won't be eating
until we can find I would have never 
guessed that a place would close at 6  
PM that's incredibly early yeah but it is 
a vibrant City at night we've got the big  
BGC letters right there a light all the 
way up that building and I don't know I  
think I'm gonna go straight hopefully 
we can find some food down this way  
and then just when we thought the day couldn't 
get any more interesting now it is starting to  
rain so I think we gotta find a spot to go get 
an umbrella Let's uh head over this way and all  
right I think we found ourselves a 7-Eleven let's 
head on in and check it out all right we're gonna  
have to get ourselves an umbrella here because of 
the rain so ah see how we even get one of these up
okay well there we go we got Secret Service here
okay long
to purchase
as you can see it should be a good one we 
should still be able to see out of this  
are you a vlogger yes are 
you a future subscriber Tim  
oh you might be yeah let's see 
here we got a uh card there for you
future subscriber Tim salamat 
and uh for this nice  
umbrella 199. one night oh we 
got a special deal today Solomon
yeah I thought the price tag said like 229 
so that means we're getting a great deal
okay 209 all right I might have uh 
nine yes let's see oh and I found it  
we got nine right oh we got a ten actually
Salama all right we got a brand new umbrella let's 
try this thing out fresh out of the box salamat  
tin okay a little garbage I think right there and 
great news my friends we got ourselves a brand new  
umbrella for like uh just about four US Dollars 
let's hit the button oh rain you can't get me now  
that is fantastic need the umbrella okay okay long  
all right so we're gonna explore this now with a 
brand new umbrella and of course we just buy the  
umbrella and now the rain is like slowing down 
a little bit but uh you know you never know when  
it's gonna start again so it's better to have it 
than not guys well the good news is is it pretty  
much has stopped raining at this point I still 
got the umbrella up because at the moment you  
can still feel like drops or like water here 
and there coming off the buildings but ah you  
know we're making the best of it we're making the 
best of being down in uh BGC at night and it is  
a super cool place guys this reminds me of like 
at night like uh Chicago or New York so it's uh  
it's an awesome place it definitely makes me 
want to come back during the day on like a  
sunny day and see what it's like over here look 
at this though like they even have like mosaic  
walls built in around the Landscaping and all 
the trees are lit up such a cool City the main  
difference like being here versus like you know 
in some of the other places I've been in Manila  
there's like a lot of like opportunities for like 
uh Street stands and interactions with the locals
okay long that's perfect there we go I jinxed it 
we're getting some good interactions here still  
I guess we got to keep the camera rolling and up 
like this nope and so yeah just look at this like  
so modern and uh wow such a different feel over 
here in BGC we've got some awesome looking coffee  
shops here like so modern called because coffee 
there and looks like we're getting right over here  
a view of High Street one Bonifacio look at 
these we've got fountains that are lit up in  
the distance and such a cool place to be looking 
at and look at this building right up here you  
have just like these like zigzag lights all the 
way up to the top Central Square of course we've  
got another Mall there and right there 
I mean we're getting like a feeling of  
square right here with this exotic looking 
advertisement TV screen that stretches all the way  
along the side of that building and we're going to 
take a walk down this way I think right here and  
we shall see all right right down here looks like 
we've got like a sports bar Burgers chili dogs  
a few of the restaurant establishments all along 
the uh area this is one I wish it wasn't wasn't  
raining up and apparently if you look at this 
sign right here there's actually T-Rexes that  
are known for crossing the street T-Rex Crossing 
why did the chicken cross the road to visit its  
Grandpa stand the T-Rex at the Mine Museum look 
left before Crossing wow all right now that's  
uh 10 out of 10 marketing right there all right 
guys luckily the rain stopped so I'm taking the  
umbrella away but at this point I'm just kind of 
just walking around the city and you know it's  
pretty enjoyable to walk around this place when 
it's not raining let's say and we're a little  
closer to the W and you can see how they have like 
just some of these accent lights leading up making  
this like aesthetic design okay so right over here 
in the center of the like BGC High Street you can  
find so many restaurants like literally of every 
type of Cuisine we got Friday's American Bar we  
got JBL speakers sold right there Pet City I mean 
those are for shops and then we also have a lot  
of restaurants Seattle's Best Coffee eye Studio 
we are going to try out one of these foul bread  
Burgers here I saw that from afar so I'm thinking 
we might have to check this one out scam chicken  
sandwich followed bread cheeseburger this looks 
like the spot I'm gonna get some like Western food  
right now because I haven't really had any since 
I've arrived to the Philippines so I figured I  
might as well test it out and see what we can 
get hello you have the best burgers in all of  
BGC yeah yeah sir oh that's perfect the foul bread 
is it oh that's I think that's going to be the one  
yeah all right and it looks like it's a double 
Patty oh so I'll be pretty full after that yeah  
oh that sounds fantastic and how 
long does it take to make a burger  
oh perfect that's a great amount 
of time all right I'll take uh  
one of those please Burger sir oh yeah the 
follow bread cheeseburger no tomatoes though  
and then um sorry uh I'll do just uh just 
solo please yeah and then uh iced tea  
you know I think that should be it for today 
please uh for yeah let's do dining 400 thank you
10 to 15 minutes
James nice to meet you James so James is taking 
care of us with the best burger in this area  
perfect just gotta get my card back yeah
all right so we've got a spot right over here 
we're gonna be eating at and yeah guys this is  
right here it's called foul bread I don't know 
if you can see the sign when I was walking up  
and it's like right down here in the High 
Street area so I'm super excited to try  
this you have a Filipino beers here yes sir 
we have Sandy Glade until set oh perfect can  
I order one of those too I didn't uh which 
one's better lights okay we'll do one light
guys I saw when I went to sit down that they 
have beers all along here so I was like you  
know I haven't tried a uh maybe I tried one or 
two Filipino beers so far since I've been here  
but I don't know if I've tried it on camera so 
figured we're gonna have to add that to the menu  
here yes sir Magano kuya yeah 85 all right that's 
a great deal and you're from Manila brother yeah  
yeah it's a nice city and this is this a new 
burger spot or it's been around for a while
how many years right here five years okay that's 
how you know it's a good burger spot guys right  
down here Prime real estate and it's uh survived 
five years and surviving and thriving when you  
got burgers on the menu like this this reminds 
me uh back in the U.S of Culver's a very very  
attractive looking Burger when I was walking 
by I was like I need to try one of these  
yeah thank you so much oh look at this thing oh 
yes that looks incredible absolutely incredible  
oh look at this so it looks like we've 
got some like sliced pickles some sort  
of like specialty sauce on there and 
two patties that are just nice and hot  
this right there that is going to be an absolute 
mouthful all right guys I'm so excited to try what  
a Filipino version of like a high quality Burgers 
like because I've had Jollibee but I haven't had  
like an actual like gourmet burger yet all 
right let's go ahead and dig right in here
oh my God that is freaking incredible 
the uh meat's like you know it's nice  
and oily and juicy the sauce they use on there  
I'm guessing that's some sort of mayo mixing 
with something else it gives it that like  
light pinkish taste and those pickles they 
aren't like overpowering you know like some  
pickles can be like super overpowering this is 
just the right amount and a nice squishy bun
that is phenomenal absolutely phenomenal
um
all right this reminds me of like going through a 
really high-end burger place in the United States  
like this gives competition to In and Out this 
gives competition to Culver's if you're from the  
US and have heard of those Burger chains they're 
like some of um the US's best but like this is  
absolutely incredible I mean I could tell from 
the photo how good it looked and the way they  
specifically the way they cook their patties 
I was going to be in love with it and by the  
way this was like 450-480 something like that so 
that comes out to you know roughly eight dollars  
so we are here in BGC and when I had the camera 
turned off I was actually talking to a Chinese  
man who lives here and he was his uh I don't know 
what city is from in China but he's all yeah VGC  
is expensive to live here so that puts it into 
perspective you know eight dollars for a gourmet  
burger right here but uh let me tell you this 
it is well worth it with how delicious this is
that is hitting the spot and then we've got 
the uh San Miguel light to mix it up with
very delicious beer it's a light beer but 
don't be fooled it is five percent alcohol  
so that thing will get you going I would relate 
this light beer to like I'm trying to think like  
you're you know like a I don't know what specific 
country related to but it's very very tasty like  
it it's so tasty it's even like refreshing 
like if you're drinking a glass of water
nothing like a beer and a burger my friends oh
um that is g triple o d my friends guys I have 
finished off that plate besides the one pickle  
that fell out of the burger and that was honestly 
for burgers that's a 10 out of 10. I kid you not  
that is literally a 10 out of 10. like one of 
the best burgers I have had while traveling  
without a doubt and it's so crazy because I 
could just tell the way that picture of the  
burger was if you remember when I first walked 
up that it was gonna be like so mouth-watering
cheers my friends Salama James 
very delicious best best burger  
in the entire country salamat 
thank you thank you very much  
that was freaking incredibly delicious 
unbelievable guys unbelievable how good that was I  
don't know if I was just super hungry from walking 
around all day but I can tell you that hit the  
spot times 10. wow yeah guys so now I'm gonna walk 
back to Makati I could take a taxi but honestly I  
want to get that walk after a massive burger and 
a beer just to burn it off you know but now it's  
saying 49 minutes and keep in mind guys when I 
went down here it ended up taking me I want to  
say like almost two full hours because I did the 
transportation I I did go the wrong way because  
there's misunderstandings but aside from that like 
it would have I found it would have been faster  
at rush hour for me to walk from Makati it would 
just been like obviously super hot so that's why  
I'm like I'm gonna do the walk back see what it's 
like and uh yeah it was fun exploring this place  
but I definitely want to check it out during the 
day when it's not raining because you know it's  
hard to explore this place when it was raining 
then it wasn't until me a while to get down and  
uh yeah guys overall just a really modern Vibe 
out here and like I was about to say this place  
reminds me of New York and it says right there 
Frankie's New York Buffalo Wings you got bars  
along there right along the edge of the street 
Yellow Cab I believe that's a pizza restaurant  
maybe and Army Navy there's just so many burgers 
broad spots or burgers at Pizza spots just like  
typical like Western food all over here we've 
even got a massive Starbucks there which you'll  
find all over here so yeah it's uh interesting 
to just walk around and just see you know like  
the more modern the city the more similarities 
you find in all the modern cities in the world  
there's a lot of Like You Know well-designed 
Places ATMs everywhere Banks everywhere  
high-end restaurants and you know the typical 
noises you hear when driving through a city  
but yeah it's just it's crazy like walking through 
this downtown versus walking through like banondo  
it's just it's a night and day difference in every 
possible way but you have trash receptacles you  
have cleanliness everywhere so you know like 
don't get me wrong though exploring banana and  
Chinatown is super cool because it's the oldest 
you know Chinatown in the world but you know it's  
also cool to see the other side of it where it's 
like the clean modern side of this part of the  
Manila greater Manila area guys I didn't have the 
camera out but we just made it to buendia if you  
remember earlier at the beginning of this video 
this is that bridge that I got so confused at  
is awesome now that I've walked it once now I 
kind of like I've been figuring out the way to  
go and everything and so we are about 24 minutes 
away and the walk's not bad like the unfortunate  
part is you have to walk along a highway so 
it's a really narrow sidewalk but like other  
than that like you know it's not a bad walk to 
Walk that distance and get some exercise you know  
oh this is a tight little sidewalk to get 
through here and let's see we made it through  
all right we gotta figure out how to get up oh 
probably right over here see you guys just wanted  
to go ahead and end today's video hope you guys 
have enjoyed coming along the adventure definitely  
uh that's the most successful video because of 
all the twists and turns we have but definitely  
a fun adventure nonetheless so I'm gonna go ahead 
and edit there guys and we'll see in the next one
