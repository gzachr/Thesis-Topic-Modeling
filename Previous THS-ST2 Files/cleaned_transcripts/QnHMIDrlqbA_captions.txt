the philippines version of silicon valley 
Sinigang Valley what is that so so Sinigang  
Valley is basically this idea right that that 
um i would say that the previous generations  
of startups in the philippines really found 
themselves and this is inherent in the philippines  
and i think in any developing nation where 
everybody was just extremely competitive with each  
other they just felt like the the pockets where 
money was being drawn from was limited so you had  
to be competitive with each other and that's fine 
that's natural i think and just in general when  
you're running a fast growing business you want to 
be the best no matter what across all industries  
um but Sinigang Valley i think 
tries to tries to you know flip  
that on its head a little bit and makes 
things a little bit more collaborative  
right so so just in general the idea is a 
collaborative startup ecosystem in community  
um but very specifically um there is 
one street in the middle of manila um  
where a lot of different parts of the ecosystem 
are starting to come together right so there's a  
there's a rapidly gentrifying neighborhood in the 
middle of the business district called Poblacion  
right and there is one street in 
publishing very small it's like 200 meters  
that a lot of people are moving into so the first 
one was actually kumu kumu took a building at the  
end of the entire building at the end of the 
street where it was basically like a work play  
live type of situation their live streamers could 
live there um their employees could live there and  
then they had office spaces there as well um and 
and and across the street there's something that's  
starting up uh opening up called the fund house 
so a lot of investors like foxmont and and some of  
the in fact some of the funds i was just talking 
about um will have office space there as well  
and then down the street you're having all these 
different startups that are looking for space  
already and starting to basically move in and the 
reason i'm using the like you know future tent  
like looking for space is because of course we've 
all been locked out so only now can we actually  
actively look at places um and so the idea is 
that basically it's going to be one street where  
you walk you look to your right and oh look 
there's a series a guy right there oh look  
there's a series b guy oh look there's kumu series 
c and then oh i've got a new idea i'm just gonna  
walk into the fund house and pitch you know every 
single investor there is um and so that's that's  
kind of the concept behind sinigang valley and 
there's actually a website sinigangvalley.com  
um the idea the name actually came 
from rexy um uh rexy of of of Kumu  
um and it really came from like a conversation 
where you know we were all just chatting or  
like yo Kumu is taking a building there we 
should all get everybody in there and then rexy  
just randomly drops the name sinigang valley 
and everybody loved it and it's taken off  
so so yeah so it's it's it's the new spot to 
be at in manila and and anybody that's in the  
startup ecosystem anybody that's visiting manila 
in the future that will be uh you know working  
within the startup ecosystem should in fact take 
the opportunity to go to Sinigang Valley and just  
like literally knock on doors meet startup a meet 
startup b meet startup c and meet the investors
