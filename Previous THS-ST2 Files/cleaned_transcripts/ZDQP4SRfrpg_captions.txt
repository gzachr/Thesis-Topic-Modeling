welcome to Eastwood San Francisco 
of the Philippines [Music]
we are now in Eastwood City guys the first 
modern Township here in the Philippines  
Eastwood is a part of Quezon City which 
is very very close to Manila city right  
yeah I love it um I work here and uh there's a 
lot of people you know walking around in malls  
and establishments so okay I love being here okay 
that's nice exactly do you think it's similar to  
San Francisco um almost almost yes yes right 
yeah there's there's a lot of similarities I  
think they're really trying to uh you know imitate 
whatever they have here this place kind of gives  
me a BGC kind of a Vibe but in a different way 
because BGC is all about modern and all about  
new buildings and all about Glass and Metal 
which one do you like more Eastwood or BGC  
you're actually like both most yeah but this one 
is about concrete and yellow style of architecture  
which is one of the reasons why people call this 
the San Francisco Philippines because it's kind  
of resembling the buildings of San Francisco what 
do you like about this Food City uh it's pretty  
much very homey and compete like anything that you 
have in mind that you want to buy it's like it's  
around like and it's a full community that you 
have here like you have the school you have the  
church you have the mall okay are you living here 
or where no I actually live across so I just walk  
from the village across and then anything that I 
needed from day to day I just go here and walk oh  
it's really cool what do you like what do 
you like Eastwood is like San Francisco
I would say somehow like I've been 
to San Francisco for like 20 toys  
but somehow it is like you know how 
like everything that you need is in  
one place and then everything is you can 
just go anywhere just by walking around  
so somehow it is I would say oh there 
these are great answers what's your
what's your business's opening call center 
is here the largest call center Center in the  
Philippines is this one do you like Eastwood City 
yeah it's pretty accessible for everything so far  
accessible for everything so right now I'm just 
looking for the nutrition people from Google Maps  
Okay I'm gonna buy some fish oil official yeah 
that's nice so it's close to everything yeah  
it is it is are you working here as well no 
I'm just living here I work at home yeah well  
you're working at home worked remotely in it or 
yeah I used to work in I.T too and I saw here  
at IBM entity that data and all the stuff I was 
like oh my God it looks like it feels like home  
but it doesn't look like home this is super 
super welcome from Big Brands like Accenture  
you have IBM we have atos you have a lot of 
other businesses opening their call centers  
here and employing lots and lots of locals so 
this is really cool even from us coming from a  
background of I.T this is really getting home 
for us which do you like more Eastwood or BGC
you have a lot of interesting personalities here 
you have Gloria Romero and and soches and Fernando  
Junior has a Walk of Fame it's really cool that's 
so cool kind of like in the states that's so nice  
in San Francisco kind of like in San Francisco 
good point GG see truly is like San Francisco in  
a way and you have here a lot of nice ornaments 
you have those water themed fishes and uh  
seahorses and looks like we have a stage 
around here okay this is a nice area yes a  
lot of people like you have Terraces there's the 
cat sitting there waiting for its order we have  
a lot of possibilities come here enjoy a coffee 
between working hours so that's pretty cool yes

your office building and then go inside of the  
big Center here and enjoy and look there's

sorry for an avocado
foreign
foreign
there's so so many like colorful things going on 
it's a super colorful alley inside the city wall  
and there's also like a mystery Manila I saw some 
letters over there I don't know what that is but  
like I had coffee and I'm very excited to be here 
okay usually I'm the one who is very excited and  
giddy today you are the giddy one I love series 
man I love nature also but I love the urban jungle  
okay well perfectly because we I brought 
you in the heart of the urban jungle Gigi  
see the stars of the Hollywood Walk of Fame is 
all the way till here oh and it goes around yes  
cool so I think you're more
or less than you're here outside 
or something like that maybe
cool maybe some other day because now there's 
only the two of us and escape room in two is not  
so much entertaining yeah well that is pretty 
nice let's go we need the archway of leaves
sorry guys I'm very excited and 
I'm hyper energetic now but I'm  
I feel like that's good I shouldn't say that okay
yo these are some big buildings here in Eastwood 
they look very fancy and very classy in the same  
time and they have like this kind of a flavor 
you could find in San Francisco right I mean  
they they're let's say I think a little bit 
older than the other buildings around because  
they look a little bit older and I would love 
to live in something like this they look like  
huge humongous I think it's very efficient to 
live here at least if you're working here that  
would be a really nice cool thing to have how 
much would an apartment go for apartment yeah
7.6 million sorry seven to nine million 79 million 
uh for how many square meters 39 39 yeah okay
okay looking in the back looking in 
the front you have huge skyscrapers  
a little bit intimidating I feel a little bit 
intimidated because like everything is so huge  
around me and I'm like okay I feel small 
but it's a man-made it's a man-made jungle
Mega World wow they're so big man yes 
and here you can see them perfectly yo  
and the palm trees all the conglomerates over 
here they look amazing and the yellowish kind  
of color you have from the San Fran Vibe 
you have like the palm trees around is  
very hot outside also so this is pretty 
cool what do you like about Eastwood City  
well aside from the vibe it's kind of 
um it's fully here compared to other
oh it's near replay so it's a good place 
for shopping the ladies yeah that's nice  
it's gorgeous thing that Eastwood 
city is similar to San Francisco
well thank you so much for the recommendations 
and I hope you're gonna have an amazing time  
like shopping and yeah I'm gonna eat a lot okay

just met once in a while in a year like twice or  
twice a year so during Christmas time we visited 
we see each other I love this thing like in my  
country we don't keep like these close connections

very important brands for like decades yeah

in the middle of all these skyscrapers you 
have a little bit of a garden and that feels  
exactly like the homey feeling the ladies were 
telling about like you have this homie feeling  
when you're in Eastwood and this is something 
you don't see in other large business centers  
around Manila right so yeah I love this Garden 
it's very very pretty and it's a good idea to  
have like a breath of oxygen in the middle of 
a crowded and obviously as everywhere in the  
Philippines there's a mall here as well and 
this one is very nice and very well decorated  
and you have a lot of shops here and glasses 
shops and bags and looks like they're small
