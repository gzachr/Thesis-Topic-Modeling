Back in 2017 me and my family went on a trip to 
palawan philippines and had an amazing experience  
with filipino food during an island hopping 
day in el nido we had to wait quite a long  
time to receive our lunch but the foods from 
the philippines that they served were worth  
the wait it was actually included in the price 
for a whole day of pinoy island hopping fun  
and of course we saw the most beautiful nature 
imaginable white sand beaches clear blue water  
ganda ng corals with tropical fish we even 
saw some animals on those secluded beaches  
i have great memories of our trip to the 
philippines in 2017 i want to try making  
some of the island food of palawan here in the 
netherlands we had some delicious grilled fish  
also known as inihaw na isda on the boat 
trip together with some lovely salads
we also had fresh fruit and some amazing drinks 
during that trip so i'm adding a little bit of  
black pepper we're gonna keep it really simple a 
little bit of garlic powder and a little bit of  
asin we're using some lovely freshly caught ocean 
mackerel today i can uh imagine again the boat  
we're on the boat we can hear the ocean sounds 
and then the birds and the engine you know the  
engine of the boat is really relaxing so together 
with our inihaw na isda during the island hopping  
we had some fresh fruits so one of the fruits i 
remember was papaya which is one of my favorites  
what i like about this island food from el nido 
palawan is that it's actually so simple you know  
it doesn't need a lot a lot of different things 
it has some fresh fruits some salad i think it's  
a it's a filipino kind of salad that i'm going 
to make today so what i remember from the uh from  
kuya who made the salad that it was quite simple 
now let me first take off the inihaw na isda  
because they're already done i like them crispy 
like this same as what we had in palawan i hope  
um look at that it looks so yummy so now back to 
the salad i don't know exactly how they made it  
but if you know a good way of making this filipino 
salad please let me know in the comments okay  
so i'm using cucumber red onions and kamatis by 
the way the weather is really getting cold look  
you can even see the steam coming out of my 
mouth i guess all we need is a little bit of  
suka and asukal and also a good sasawan for the 
fish you know i changed my mind for the sasawan  
i'm gonna just use the suka pinakurat which 
is nice and spicy for the grilled fish no
this one i believe is called ensaladang pinoy 
i'm gonna make a nice dressing for this suka if  
you like this video guys please don't forget 
to hit the thumbs up okay a little bit of  
soy sauce some paminta a little bit of sugar and 
then we will mix this all together and should  
be our salad since it's already getting 
wintertime i have one surprise for you  
i am planning to make another lechon belly 
video soon as a very special one and also i  
made the beef bulalo already so if you did not 
see that one yet you can watch it here okay
the inihaw na isda is really nice 
thank you so much for watching  
i'll see you next time with more filipino food
