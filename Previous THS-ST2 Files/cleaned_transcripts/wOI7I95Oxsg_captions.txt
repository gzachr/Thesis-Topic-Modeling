hey guys KNL here
at first, stop blaming and love each other
-yeah, love each other
today, we're gonna share our thoughts about this issue
#CANCELKOREA
do you know what it is?
-yeah
Bella Poarch
Filipino-American Tiktoker, SNS star
#CANCEL KOREA
it started from Bella Poarch's dance video
and some Korean people blamed her
because of a tattoo that resembled of the rising sun flag
and she apologized for that on her SNS
and she said
"I immediately had it covered and scheduled for removal"
that's it, no problem so far
-yeah
that's it, that's enough
but some rude Koreans
yeah...some rude Korean netizens leaving comments
that are very offensive to Filipino
I read those comments...
and I never wanna see that again
yeah...really it was terrible
so that's why Filipino started #CANCELKOREA
-yeah
that's the truth of this situation
so, let's share our thoughts about this issue
-okay
those comments...
as a Korean, it made me ashamed
bad comments have always been a social problem in Korea
there are some rude people in Korea
and bad comments exist in any country
I apologize on behalf of some rude Koreans
I wanna talk something to rude Koreans
"Shame on you"
your behavior is not patriotic, it's not good for Korea
not good!
rising sun flag
yeah, that's a bad thing
it is similar to Hakenkreuz
but...
but she didn't know that
and she immediately apologized
that's enough!
end!
she apologized
and she said "I will remove the tattoo"
everyone has the freedom to get tattoos
and she apologized
as soon as she learned of the painful history, that's enough
I understand why Filipinos are angry
the comments were terrible...
terrible....
I am angry even though I am Korean
if there's something wrong with someone
don't blame, just tell gently
Korea and Philippines have been on good terms for a long time
yeah, you know that?
Philippines helped Korea a lot when Korea was poor
-everyone knows that
they helped us a lot
(during the Korean war, when Korea was poor)
and now, Korea give supports to Philippines
we have a good relationship now
but some Korean netizens are ruining it
it's so sad
-so sad, they're rude people
In short
Korea-Philippines, we are friend
KNL support PH
we plan to keep supporting you guys
stop blaming each other, be happy
to. Rude Koreans
you should be thankful for a good memory
before you get angry with a painful memory
you can say that agian
to. Rude Koreans
hey, just live happily
don't be so mean
nice
