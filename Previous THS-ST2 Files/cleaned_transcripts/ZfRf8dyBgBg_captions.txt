- There's this old story of a rich man
and a fisherman that I love.
I'm not gonna share the
whole story with you
but the gist of it goes like this.
There was a rich man
that during the middle of the work week,
was walking down along
the ocean, near a pier,
to try to think about
how to make more money
and how to close his latest deal
and in the distance there was a fisherman
that was just casting his fishing line
out into the ocean,
trying to catch some fish
for that day's dinner.
And as he got closer to him, the rich man
asked the fisherman, what
are you doing out here,
it's a work day, how come you're
fishing instead of working?
And the fisherman said,
why would I wanna do that?
And the rich man said
well, if you're out there
working and making more money,
you could buy a bigger house,
and then the fisherman said,
and why would I wanna do that?
And the rich man said,
well then you could buy
a nicer car with even more money.
And the fisherman said, and
why would I wanna do that?
And then again the rich man said,
well if you're out there and
you're putting in 12 hours
or 14 hours or 16 hours,
then you can make even more and more
and maybe one day you're
gonna be able to buy a yacht.
And the fisherman again said
and why would I wanna do that?
And a bit exasperated by this
point in the conversation,
the rich man says, well if
you work your whole life
many hours and work very hard,
then one day, even if it was
in the middle of a work week,
you'll be able to be sitting out here
in the ocean, relaxing and
enjoying the sun on your back
and not having a care in your life.
And then the fisherman said
and what do you think I'm doing right now?
You know, I think so
many of us work so hard
to try to find contentment and peace
at some future time in life
and in my journeys here
in the Philippines,
I really had to rethink, what does it mean
to live a content life?
If you are more interested
in what that looks like
in your own life, follow
along, I have more
to share with you in this episode.
(upbeat music)
So here in the Philippines,
like everywhere else,
there's a lot of rich people,
there's middle class
people and there's people
who really have nothing.
And here, if you go to an average home,
very different than a home in the US
or Australia or England.
They tend to be quite a bit smaller
and I gotta be honest,
where I've lived here
has even been very small,
most of the time 25,
40 square meters and I've learned
to live in a space that's really maybe 10%
of the space that I lived at in the US
and when I look at those around me here,
what I see is they're contented
with so much less in their life.
Maybe there's not air
conditioning, even if it's hot.
Maybe they don't have much variety
when they go to the store and
look for something to eat.
Life here for the most
part is a lot simple,
depending if you live in kind
of a smaller country area,
called province areas here or a big city,
your life may be a lot less
complicated or more complicated
but on the whole, there's
a lotta people here
that inside of their hearts,
inside of their minds,
live a much more content life
and I'm still learning and failing
it my quest to become more content
like the people that I'm inspired by
around me here in the Philippines.
But there's a few things
that I've learnt here
that I've found helpful so far
and I hope that you'll
find helpful as well.
So one of the first
things that I've noticed
with people here is that
I think really helps
with them living a content
life, is being understanding.
You know life is not always perfect
and I think that for so much of my life,
I want things to be perfect,
I want things to go the way that I want,
I want to not have any drama
or things to go unexpectedly.
What I find here is that
things always go unexpectedly.
Things are really challenging here,
especially if you come
from a Western perspective
where you expect that things
are gonna go a certain way.
People are gonna show up on time,
paperwork is gonna be
processed in a particular way.
The people that you deal with
are all gonna have the same answer.
You go to the grocery market
and you ask one person
if they have strawberries
in stock and they say no,
that if you then ask the second person,
is there strawberries in stock?
They're not gonna tell you yes.
But those are the little
things that happen here.
Sometimes you have to ask three people
the same questions to
get the one right answer.
Is that a big deal?
Well when you come from California
and you've lived in a fast-paced life,
yeah, sometimes it feels like a big deal.
But what I find here is that
with the Filipinos around me,
it's not such a big deal.
So I really need to look
at myself and ask myself,
what's more important?
To be around people who are understanding,
to be around people that
feel content in their life
or to get the same answer
or to have things done more efficiently.
Sometimes I struggle with the
answer to that to be honest
but the more I look at
the level of understanding
that people around me
have here, the more I know
that understanding is the first step
on the path to contentment in my life.
Gotta love that wind, sorry guys.
The second thing that is really important
when it comes to living a
content life is acceptance.
Sometimes things go in a way
that you're not happy with
and so you might not accept that.
And one of the things that was kinda
a light bulb moment in my own life,
is that I had a hard time accepting things
because in my mind,
acceptance meant agreement.
In other words I thought that
if I actually said that
I accept this thing
that is unacceptable, that I
somehow agree that it's okay.
It doesn't mean that at all though,
accepting means that even
if you're not happy with it,
because let's face it, you
don't need to accept something
if it's not actually a challenge,
if there's not actually
something to accept.
So it's on the one hand,
acknowledging that something isn't right,
but it's accepting that,
this is how things are
and when you accept things, you'll find
that it's a lot easier
to have a content life
because you'll be able to
not be fighting against it
and instead, accept it and move on
and learn how to cope with it.
A third area when it comes to living
a content life is thankfulness.
I find that even when I look back at 2020
and things haven't
changed much here in 2021,
even though it was such
a challenging life,
being locked down, having to wear mask
and face shields here, it really
was a very strict lockdown
here in the Philippines and
that's why the numbers here
have stayed so low, but it
also posed a lot of challenges.
I was away from my family for a year now
and counting when I plan to go back.
It's impacted my business,
there's been so many challenges
in my life over the past year
but I find that when I take
the time to be thankful,
when I think about the new
condo I was able to buy here,
a new car, when I think
about more importantly,
the new friendships that I have,
with a number of people that
come to mind immediately.
When I think of the laughter and the joy
and the positive people around me,
there's so much that I
have to be thankful for.
My health is okay, you
know, there's so many things
that if we just stop in our life,
could really think about what do we have
to be thankful for in our life?
And be so much easier to be content.
When we're focused on
all of the negatives,
we're gonna feel distant,
but when we focus
on what we have to be thankful,
we're gonna feel a lot better
and a lot more at peace.
Take a moment right now,
think about what it is
that you're thankful for in your life.
Drop us a comment below
and let us know on that.
So last area that I wanna talk about
when it comes to living a content life,
is self growth, is challenging yourself.
I think that one of the things
that happens with us is if we feel unhappy
or discontent, that we tend to hide
or we try coping with things
that aren't super healthy in our life
instead of focusing on things
that are gonna help us
to feel more content
because we're pushing ourself,
we're challenging ourself
or seeing improvements
in areas of our life.
So perhaps one of the most
important things you could do
when you feel not content in your life
is to focus on challenging
yourself, growing in the areas
that matter to yourself,
seeing improvement
and feeling the enjoyment of becoming
a better version of yourself.
So listen, I know it's difficult
for any one of us to share things
about whether we feel
content or discontent
but I'm curious this
year, how are you feeling
and also if you have any practical tips
or ways that you help
yourself live a content life,
drop a comment below and let us know.
