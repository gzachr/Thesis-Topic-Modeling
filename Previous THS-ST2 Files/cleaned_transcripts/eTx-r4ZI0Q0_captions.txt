thank you
hello and good afternoon and welcome to another
explorers video hi everybody today we are
at home because outside let me show you the
weather is very gloomy and sad and rainy but
nevertheless what can we do on an afternoon
like this Gigi eat yes eat our good friend
Vincent slash bimbo slash billy slash whatever
else nicknames he had she decided to give
us this huge
back full of snacks which is bigger than to
use my mind face so time to set up all these
snacks and prepare the testing apparatus facilities
so we can probably check the food out
so we have a huge selection of food here and
honestly I have no idea what we got here we
got a ton of stuff from crackers to more chips
to peanuts to stuff so what shall we start
with you first what do you think I think we
can start with any of them something that
has like a okay Savory taste I choose this
one because I like pounds Gigi whatever it
is mine is called Oishi prawn crackers let's
see how it is I will choose this one because
it's very similar to something we tasted in
Malaysia cheese Rings okay mine smells like
uh
so now we're tasting the best chocolate snacks
from Philippines I hope you're gonna enjoy
this video yeah [Music]
I like it okay perfect
food
I would say hmm out of 10.
very good they say only natural shrimps okay
I kind of doubt that how are you like sweet
cheesy
I like them and my country in Romania these
kind of snakes are wrong like this and cover
it with like a bright yellow color so they
don't taste sweet but yeah this is sweet try
this one also let me read this one six six
seven out of ten okay [Music] oh
my goodness come on for me yeah I don't know
guys if you like it I would give probably
this one Oishi fun crackers a three out of
ten okay and I would give your things let
me see [Music] let's see I like it better
[Music] hi okay let's continue our journey
with the Roadhouse Barbecue piacos
let's see how this one is I think we better
try one yeah and it's easier for us to keep
calm okay gigi go for the piattos [Music]
doesn't smell like barbecue
wow these are so good these are like a I don't
know very soft chips with a very barbecue
kind of powder from the garlic they're good
but they're lacking something like a punch
I like them
[Applause] with nachos or uh foreign
region snacks rice crackers vegetable flavored
okay regions safety
oh yeah whoa just look at the color okay wow
immediately you see the color and it's green
so good okay oh I like I like the veggie kind
of flavor [Music] not veggie at all it's sweet
yeah like everything else so far it tastes
like a soup yeah if you dip corn Cheetos and
Maggie soup cooking this tastes like Maggie
soup hmm oh yes rice crackers so far nine
eleven for me this one too do these have gluten
no no idea Gigi they don't have gluten guys
because they're rice crackers that's so cool
I want I wish something like this could be
in my country as well I still like these ones
better so I'll give that maybe a tomato good
let's see Jack and Jill chippy flavor barbecue
corn something okay and on the back you have
a comic book they say OK Google true
okay secret secret let's see let's see if
secret or natural cigarette [Music]
these are kind of like corn dogs or like barbecue
or something like that what do you call them
tortillas mini tortillas you look like this
okay they smell like nothing [Music] absolutely
[Music] are you being barbecues salty
oily oily
I like that it's simple no extra flavor rather
than the yeah I would expect something more
barbecue eat punching but and salt yeah oh
this is all good what about you same same
thing very good we have same taste from these
ones okay let's continue on the scale with
shrinky stuff
okay do you so this is how the bag looks like
yeah
snakes yummy flakes shrimp flavor yummy yummy
in my tummy cheers [Music]
these are these tastes better than the other
one yes definitely this thing actually tastes
like shrimp the other one would taste like
some kind of dried fish kind of thing emoji
but 9 out of them also good wow no then yes
they are probably just once they're really
good so far six out of ten for me six sorry
guys I'm not a big fan of shrimp okay then
we go continue with potato fries call let's
see if the Oishi potato fries actually tastes
like potatoes because they are definitely
fried or something and they are I think ketchup
flavored or something I don't know let's try
it like this like this thank you beautiful
fry but in a coffee fan of corn cheers good
[Music] okay interesting let me try more I
still have the shrimp flavor man
[Music] they say big not fried okay on the
side it says make not fried so they're big
but they don't don't look like fries inside
they look like suspended off something something
okay what do you give them to eat I usually
love tomato flavored stuff or snacks bud maybe
this is similar to this one how much should
I give for this one it's the same sport same
score okay editing Michael will have to work
out and give you the same score for that never
open for me they're kind of okay but not that
much let's continue with the big one here
big one we have cheat
okay I love chicharon let's see if this is
actually tasting like sugar and I will open
a little bit this one this beautiful release
to wash our taste buds a little bit because
everything it's like oh okay I want to look
at this one no I open this I have to try this
yes in case you don't know chicharoni's fried
pork fat yes cheers
[Music] um
not sour a little bit of flour flavored in
what wait now that I see it says
kind of pushed me off in a bit maybe inside
but the flavor might reach chips my work none
of them open if you make them all pork they're
all depends for me so far it ties with the
green things and with the other thing magic
that we had the shrimp one six out of ten
times look it's um it's a bit too sour for
my taste time for some refreshments and in
the meantime I can choose our next destination
which is ah let's go with the other ones potato
fries tomato ketchup this one is plain and
salty let's see if these ones are a better
security than the Tomato ones this is how
it looks like currently I think you can hear
it
[Music] um [Music] I like it it's simple stuff
um
cheers little apple green tea [Music]
it's a huge fan foreign [Music]
[Music]
[Music]
or something like bubbly okay I opened the
Mama's eggnog cookies I think just so we have
a different approach this time sweet yes sweet
oh God I like how the presentation they're
very small and cute and they fit like in your
mouth um they're like if you guys know the
Italian cookies the small ones made out of
almonds yeah but they also have the bitterness
they don't have the bitterness or the flavor
but the Crunchies I never tried they know
but like no paste like this [Music] on the
sweet side I would say maybe [Music]
I think the same thing good very good same
yeah now we have Farm to snack for money banana
chips caramelized sugar banana chips who doesn't
love banana chips let's see tip number two
[Music]
when in doubt use your teeth okay [Music]
I like the packaging the other ones are more
old school did you [Music] they look sweet
they look like bananas and they look sweet
because they have like a sugar coating but
it's interesting the banana chips normally
are cuts um Against the Grain mostly like
circles these are like long wedges kind of
things [Music] oh yes I love banana juice
but I like them more spicy I tried them in
India I love them
yeah but if you put some spicy on top it's
even better oh wow so far without the spices
it doesn't have to kick guys this is really
yes banana crisps caramelized sugar so they
are made apparently with sugar cane juice
don't get me wrong but I like them spicy I
like banana too spicy I don't like to Sweet
that much for me okay we have peanuts nagaraya
Brands zero trans fats zero cholesterol original
cracker nuts coated peanuts okay
it's so good it's not so sweet hello baby
I love it okay stick your hand for some peanuts
okay thank you [Music] oh yeah
they're super salty when you put your tongue
on them these are the original flavor okay
kind of black I like the coating this but
original ones are kind of black you're like
peanuts
is it all of them yeah definitely look at
these peanuts you can taste the coating but
I think something tells me that we have here
better ones we have yeah we have one cookie
ones then we have adobo works so let's see
how these are compared to the original one
so these are butter flavored I like them I
would give them an eight out of ten okay
but I think we should switch these ones I
don't know we still have to okay now I'm not
done with these ones well yeah
they have more coating than the other ones
okay definitely an improvement [Music] um
you often there's hot here they have a bit
of the double flavor it's very mild
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music] hello and now I put the rest out of
the net the barbecue flavored one something
tells me that is
please
[Music]
[Music] okay let's see
[Music] hmm whoa the crunch yes these are
the crunches barbecue
[Music] oh yes it really explodes in your
mouth
yes
same this one so far no good nine out of ten
yes on the same level with the green stuff
with the chicharrones and with the shrimpy
shrimps okay we have more stuff to try oh
we have some of these things that we had before
some peacockos with the Roadhouse but this
time I have them with cheese so let's try
them out as well what can be better and be
couples yeah cheese ones [Music] cheese

yes nice job now we have super
strips bacon flavor snacks no meat goodness
okay cool make your favorite snacks it tastes
like bacon it tastes like bacon did you try
they look like bacon wow wow they literally
looks like bacon yeah I love the strips and
the details okay I got a bunch because that's
the perfect way of tying snacks in a bunch
work if you try it one by one this is the
winner guys
I love it I love it it is home again no Meats
Bacons perfect we have something small at
home it's called cracks one of my go-to snacks
but it's not my God so for me
I like the other ones this whole thing stuff
is out of this world I love this one okay
this is getting smaller and smaller let me
switch these ones a little bit because the
so we have proof that we try literally everything
yes so we have now on the list Savory toasted
bread with garlic no added MSG okay garlic
let's see garlic bread
garlic bread looks like a very very tiny brusquehanna
okay
um
the remaining enemy is going wild right now
it's good does it have it's right
I have an idea you take one of these things
okay put it in your hand and you take one
of these things we have both combine them
but who's snacking with balls like
um
exactly what I was saying if beef had garlic
they would have been the best thing in the
world so so far
they're good but it's just garlic so it needs
something more to have that in your fishing
what about you sure for me it's an eight out
of ten nowhere sweet Squad
um smells like corn it smells like sweet and
they look like balls yeah little balls drains
from heaven this is how they look like
we have something similar in our country but
they're colored they're corn flavored they're
salty and they're sweet
um
maybe let's do it more hard
more sweet and more sweet definitely huh that's
good I like it
next thing we have no this year in crunchier
real garlic chips
garlic flavor boy garlic flavor boy that was
not good pronounced oh boy let's see
oh I think they know what they are they're
cold really cold yes okay I like the spicy
kind let's see what how these are
very likely for them to be cordless um
that's good but the garlic bread is better
but it is corn yeah caliber is better
okay I could eat this we have some crackers
oh butter coconut crackers
did you have a cracker Parker
these are sweet oh yeah they have sugar coconut
they have a little bit of a coating or something
um nice
