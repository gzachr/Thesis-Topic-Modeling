time and time again history proves that
warfare isn't
entirely a numbers game and one of the
best examples of this rule in action
took place during the korean war when a
small filipino force held their ground
against a far larger chinese division
while the numbers were almost certainly
blown out of proportion for the purposes
of propaganda
some of the more conservative estimates
still speak of victory
against all odds in this video
we pay our respects to the 900 brave
filipinos
who fought in the highly exalted battle
of yultong or yuldong
[Music]

before we get stuck into the battle of
yulton just
what were the filipinos and chinese
doing in korea anyway
well the korean war was one of the
bloodiest wars of the cold war era
at the end of the second world war korea
was essentially divided into two halves
the soviet union administered north half
and the united states administered south
half both korean governments were
certain that they and not their north or
south counterpart were in charge of the
country however
and on the 25th of june 1950 the north
korean people's army marched into south
korea
in response the united nations started
deploying its forces
with 21 u.n member countries ultimately
answering the call
the philippines was one of such
countries deploying the philippine
expeditionary force to korea
or pef tok in august that same year
peptok entered korea at a strength of
1486
but it grew to include some 7500 during
the conflict
one of the units under pep talk was the
10th battalion combat team or simply the
10th
bct which will get too soon
sharing a border with korea and
maintaining different ideologies to the
western bloc
it's no wonder that china watched the
korean war with
weary eyes in the words of chinese
premier
zao and lee directed at the un korea is
china's neighbor
the chinese people cannot help but be
concerned
with a solution to the korean question
when u.n forces invaded north korea in
october
china mustered the chinese people's
volunteer army or pva
crossed the yalu river and north korea
and startled the un
forces position there into a hasty
retreat
this was the first of the pva's five
major offensives in the korean war
with their last being the fifth phase
offensive or spring offensive
during which they messed with the wrong
group of fighting filipinos
in the lead-up to the battle of yuletong
the aforementioned
10th bct was attached to the u.s 3rd
infantry division
north of the south korean county of
yanchan and just
east of imchen river the third u.s
infantry division
deployed the attached u.s 65th infantry
regiment
the filipino 10th bct and the turkish
brigade to stop
three advancing chinese army corps
the americans set up on a north to south
front parallel to the imjin river while
the filipinos watched the 65th northeast
flank
the turks held a broad west to east
front just east of the 10th bct
it began at 8pm on the 22nd of april
1951
an artillery barrage lit up the night
sky
landing on the turkish brigade and
blowing them to shreds
some four hours later artillery and
mortar shells
pummeled the entire 3rd infantry
division front
paving the way for machine gun and small
arms fire
now falling upon the 10th bct was
an entire pvn division either the 34th
division of the 12th army
according to the un or the 44th division
of the 15th army
according to the chinese either way the
division was at least
10 000 troops strong with propaganda
estimates reaching as high as
40 000. what ensued was a series of
close quarter engagements
in which the filipino 10th bct managed
to hold
its ground the americans and turks
however
couldn't handle the heat and retreated
several hundred meters
south leaving the 10th bct standing like
a lone island
in a relentless red sea stranded
and severely outnumbered the 10th bct
put its foot down and decided it would
stop the chinese advance
then and there or die trying
either way they gave the pvn division a
fight that china will never forget
filipino drivers medics clerks typists
cooks and even the units
chaplin took up arms and threw
themselves into the battle
which raged in pockets throughout the
10th bct's position
in the words of fighting filipino
luminoso cruz
the chinese attacked us in waves all
night
my buddy and i just kept firing and
firing our rifles
slowly but surely however the pvn attack
eroded the 10th bct's position
and most of the unit complied with an
order to fall back to a secondary line
most but for the 10th bct's tank
company this wasn't an option under the
command of filipino captain conorado yap
the company drove toward a hill captured
by the pvn where the company aimed to
rescue as
many filipino survivors and recover as
many dead filipino bodies as they could
to this end the company succeeded saving
the lives of an incredibly grateful 10th
bct squad
for his bravery however captain yap
himself paid the ultimate price
receiving his philippine armed forces
medal of valor
posthumously the citation read
captain yap in a desperate effort to
rescue the lost unit
ordered for covering support from the
other units under his command
and personally led a furious
counter-attack to regain the hill
position
and rescue the trapped unit despite an
authority that he may withdraw which he
has already received
he then proceeded to assault an enemy
emplacement about 300 yards away
despite the hail of enemy fires until he
fell
dead from an enemy bullet captain yap
also received the united states
distinguished service cross
with the citation reading he fearlessly
led
a daring charge to reach the beleaguered
platoon
under heavy fire received from flanks
they relentlessly pressed the assault
regained the hill evacuated the
casualties and rescued the isolated unit
observing a stricken soldier on the
slope of the hill captain yap
immediately started toward the men but
was mortally wounded by a burst of enemy
fire
inspired by his heroic conduct his men
continued the fight with such
determination and skill
that the enemy attack was contained and
numerous casualties were inflicted
by dawn the 10th bct had scarcely given
any ground to the chinese division and
in covering the third infantry
division's retreat
the filipinos had utterly exhausted
their enemy
whose offensive was growing weaker by
the second
tiles the 10th bct then launched a
counter-attack
pushing the chinese back a few places on
the board and putting an
end to the battle of ultong while the
filipino 10th bct suffered 56 casualties
in total
these fearless soldiers cooks and
chaplains
and whoever else was able to pick up a
gun managed to kill more than
500 chinese troops throughout the battle
it's safe to say that the filipinos
proved themselves a force to be reckoned
with
over those two days in april 1951.
but maybe this was better expressed in
the words of filipino major
maximo young who was actually there
the battle of yuldong was the greatest
filipino victory in the korean war
it was one of many battles fought by the
united nations command in an effort to
repel the biggest
offensive of the korean war the
communists great
spring offensive by 6 am of the 23rd of
april
the 10th bct was one of only
two unc units on the western front not
overran or
wiped out by the tremendous chinese
assault
pep talk to me is the embodiment of
filipino patriotism
but what do you guys think had you heard
about the battle of yuletong before this
did the 10th bct really face off against
as many as 40 000 chinese troops
or was that just propaganda lastly would
you have agreed when american general
douglas macarthur said
give me 10 000 filipino soldiers and i
will conquer the world
