Hi guys today we're gonna show you a behind
the scene look at the tour that I managed and
Travis came a long
because he is the official tour photographer.
And this tour is organized by Christian Filipina
which is a terrific dating website.
I heard the reason so many of you guys are
interested in the Philippines is cause you're
actually
interested in meeting Filipinas.
Well not only this site a great way to do
that but they also provide this really awesome
luxury tours
that we're so happy to be a part of.
This is part 1 of behind the scenes of our
experience on this current tour
so let's roll it.
The Muslim prayer room at the Manila Airport.
I've always wondered what goes on in here.
Let's check it out.
What took you so long?
I had to stop and say a few prayers for a
safe flight.
You want a safe flight right?
I was in the prayer room.
There is a prayer room there?
I should stay there then.
So what are we doing?
Why Are we at the airport?
We're off to another executive tour management
project.
We are blessed that we get to travel for work
but this is still work but however I learned
that I do my best work when I'm having fun
and I think you'll find the same as true in
your life too.
How do you feel about getting to work a job
professionally in tourism?
It really works in your skill set well.
Well, I'm so happy and glad, I'm glad that
I'm able to do what I love to do and the most
fulfilling
part is when I see my guests enjoying his
trip.
That's just priceless.
What was your longest job?
My longest job, I think was in ABS-CBN (Local
TV Network) working for TV Production.
And now you're working in tourism, running
these tours and providing this great service.
Do you think working at the TV station ABS-CBN
was good training for that?
It was!
Actually when I was working at ABS-CBN, one
of the jobs that I did was to organize the
trips like
take care of logistics, book flights, book the hotels
and things like that.
This is Mactan Cebu International Airport
it is smaller than Manila but it is easier
to go around.
We're getting picked up in style in this nice
van.
So Imabelle's friends who also happens to
work in tourism, they're taking us to this
restaurant.
They say it's pretty good, so we're gonna
check it out.
Scallops.
That's pretty good.
That's my first time ever eating a scallop.
I never had one before.
They're pretty good.
So it's late at night.
We didn't expect to get in this late but we're
at the hotel and we're gonna check in
and get a goodnight's sleep.
We've actually never stayed at this hotel
at least I've never stayed in it before.
OKay let's check out this room.
Okay.
Very nice.
Now this is a very nice, very big room, and
I'll be honest I didn't
really know what to expect because the lobby,
it was okay and the hallway is okay but to
be honest with you, they just look
kinda old like maybe form the 80's or 90's.
They're not bad but they just look like it
hasn't been remodelled for a long time.
So I didn't really know what to expect for
the room.
The reason Imabelle chose this hotel is
because her first choice, the pool is being
renovated so there is no pool for her client
to use and that was important to him.
This place has a pool which we'll check out
tomorrow but I'm very impressed with the room.
The rooms are clearly very nice, very large.
The other great thing about this hotel is
the location.
That's one of the other main reasons people
wants to stay here is the location.
Let's check out the bathroom.
Okay, we'll there you go.
Oh wow.
This is important to me anyways.
A nice deep big bathtub so yeah this room
is very nice and judging by the lobby-well
this hotel looks okay
but it's like so many other hotels in the
Philippines where they just look what they
haven't been remodelled in a long time so
this place has a great location and the actual
rooms which is actually what's most important
very nice.
Its been a long day and now it's time for
me to get some sleep.
I will see you tomorrow.
Let's check out the breakfast.
So what do you think of the breakfast here?
I think the breakfast is good.
They have what I like.
I got my bacon and eggs so that's what's most
important I suppose.
It's a nice sunny morning and I am off to
the airport to meet my executive tour client.
This is one of the funnest part of the being
an executive tour manager what's even more fun
is that I'll be able to witness
one of the magical moments of his life and
that is meeting his love of his life from
the Philippines.
We're now at the temple of Leah and we took
my parents here as you might recall in that video.
And it's a work in progress.
It's not finished but this is a temple to
a man's wife that he built for her, hence
the name temple of leah.
It's pretty cool because it's almost like
you're at the Pantheon in Greece.
And down there you can see the city of Cebu.
A Spanish fort that's hundreds of years old.
Are you Happy with the photo?
Very glad to hear that.
I didn't think you could do it.
So this is actually the original cross that
Magellan planted here in Cebu.
So this is the end of Day 2 this is actually
the first day that the clients got here and
they are
so thrilled with the way the trip is going
so far which really makes us happy to hear.
We're
just glad that we can provide this service
and provide people with the opportunity to
come
have a safe trip but still have the time of
their lives.
So we're just happy to be sharing this with
you guys as well.
Check out part 2 where we go swimming with
the whale sharks.
Show you a new awesome hotel and resort and
continue on with excellent adventures.
