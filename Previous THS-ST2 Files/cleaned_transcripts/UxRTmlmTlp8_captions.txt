ax in here oh yeah when I was in Australia
Joe always teach me a lot of Australian slangs

Australian before I think you can educate
you can teach her a lot am I talking too fast
no no it's okay again so you understand me
yeah okay she actually only understands Australian
accent because because enjoy the view this
is Manila
thank you yeah so I think now we're just going
to click the Dropout bags I think after that
we're going to go to our Apartments it's funny
because my mother's reaction just when she
first came to the hotel she told me that the
hotel is here the impression is a foreigner
the hotels in BGC are really expensive it's
around 250 Australian dollars per night oh
she said she looked to a lot of hotels in
the area and this is the cheapest one already
250 now that we're in the hotel so I'm gonna
go back to the apartment we're gonna open
up her luggage and see our treasure our victories
his mother bring a full luggage for some reasons
and we're gonna unboxing
[Music]
welcome to my mother's and Josh's room it's
strange saying this for this one day for one
days on the right side here there's cabinet
and the left side here there is the bathroom
wow lots of amenities here actually you've
got all the body wash and shampoo see so nice
and uh this is the the bed for tonight I guess
it's pretty pretty comfy yeah pretty comfy
but this is jump jump and The View oh wow
wow this is a different view that we never
see oh I see our apartment over there there
at a corner that Gap yeah yeah our apartment
is over there the no the one behind the brown
white one yeah in the in the middle of the
Gap yeah yeah yeah yeah that one there's like
10 minutes walk I would say yeah I think the
unboxing let's see all right open luggage
yeah dark chocolate yay I saw the vitamins
okay so my mother actually brought me a lot
of vitamins here different I think multivitamins
you said it's a lot of dark chocolate here
[Music]
ring
[Music]
so you you choose two bottles that will work
in our suitcase which one do you want to drink
you like red and remember you like red right
or you like wine or white wine I like all
wine
okay how about we bring one bread to Boracay
and we bring one
that's like the cushion oh and there are more
presents oh really because my mother actually
bought me a backpack because the backpack
that I have existing one in the Philippines
that one kind of have a small hole already
that's why she got me a new one yeah thank
you so much oh that's a new backpack wow looks
so nice looks so big too it's so big here
yeah so good the thing about my old backpack
is that it's not very adjustable and also
not a lot of space so I I either can only
bring my camera or drone so either one cannot
bring both sometimes can't even bring both
[Music]
so now it's clear currently daytime so this
is actually the center of BGC one of the main
roads here in fiji's area is this area where
those are restaurants and clothing brands
on the side and then yeah this is where people
were spending weekends that normally during
the daytime and night time it's a two complete
different scene because it's so different
at night all the lights lights up around here
so it's really beautiful and later on we'll
bring you to the big TV in in BGC which is
really beautiful at night AI today yeah I
know hello thank you Paul the thing I like
about BGC is that there are lots of greeneries
like plants all around oh actually we've been
here and um we've been to Cebu many many years
ago but Manila I think it's the first time
it's really good I mean this area looks modern
it looks like Hong Kong looks like Singapore
I agree I think that this this area reminds
me a bit of Hong Kong some parts [Music] yes
it is basically where Ellen and I usually
spend our time in BGC sometimes when we do
some filming for I don't know some companies
we do it maybe at some of these tables just
because the background looks nice it's a few
goods showing them around where we normally
eat and yeah spend our time I think it's very
interesting
thank you
[Music] yeah just scared to walk after you
put on the shoes yeah yeah my mother was just
saying like sometimes uh some doggies I guess
some pet owners that maybe they love their
pets a lot so they give them lots of clothings
and shoes and everything but maybe the dog
doesn't want it BGC is probably the most modern
part of Manila yeah the most you can see I
think the city planning is probably done the
best here as well because there are more plants
compared to other districts in Manila specifically
in BGC you can get one of these bikes so using
QR codes and you can scan and you can start
using them if you ever come to the Philippines
our favorite Philippine restaurant has to
be manam manam is one of it's actually the
first restaurant we tried and also our favorite
restaurant second we look out for but today
I want to give my parents the best experience
here in Mana in the Philippines so of course
gonna bring it to Manon it's one of the I
guess like an elevated version of a comfort
Filipino food and then you can see these drinks
are very tasty yeah mango pomelo Sago I think
that's so big yeah and we normally order the
papaya wait oh yeah that's one that's one
number so four people of course yeah that
one is nice hey guys hope you enjoyed this

[Music] yeah honestly I'm very excited to
bring them here because it's been yeah I've
been thinking about this moment for a very
long time and I've ever seen some arrive in
the Philippines actually I've been thinking
to bring my parents here and then just like
try the sinigang and everything here so the
main dish that we're gonna try for sure is
a sinigang which is a sour soup in the Philippines
that we're gonna mix it with watermelon so
that's a fusion here which is this one actually
it's got baby ribs watermelon synagogue yeah
so usually sinigang doesn't have watermelon
but this is a like a fusion more refreshing
yeah it has a little bit more like of a sweet
taste to neutralize that sourness oh and we
also can order the house crispy seasick so
I'm not going to tell you guys the ingredients
inside okay I'm gonna try it and I'll tell
you what it is it's just that you said you
will have CC you will have synagogue this
one gonna order medium sinigang yeah this
one will be all the small one yeah okay let's
try this one oh good yeah something different
what is that one I don't know it's called
Cameroon Cameroon foreign [Music]
I think I'll let you guys try first and then
I'll tell you what it is I think it's better
that way yeah of course yeah thank you
sorry mango yes and that's a sinigang so that's
a medium size oh both so basically they said
this is like a Filipino version of tempura
it's good I think has a lot of watermelon
this one I took too much here we saved some
for other people so I'll give you more soup
okay what you can do is you can eat it at
the rice in a soup or you can add the soup
onto the rice either way which one whichever
one suits you more yeah I like that way more
because you get more soup all right let's
see
[Laughter] sour yeah a little bit okay let's
see JoJo
you need to get closer microphone
very much really oh you like sour dishes that's
good
yes it's good yeah I see Joey they put all
the rice inside yeah it's uh I like it that
way more actually sour yeah really yeah [Music]
thank you
so good try lemongrass pretty nice so there's
a lemongrass drink very refreshing yeah wow
more I think very refreshing should I say
okay you like it
so tasty yeah she always picks the best drink
you know yeah amazing here we've got four
drinks so that one is the mango pomelo Sago
that was a lemongrassment the one my mom ordered
and this one is the usual one we got strawberry
with Camille
yeah that one's very tasty guys I I we've
never tried that one before but what I recommend
and last one I ordered the Buko pandan Sago
Buco is Yang coconut
a lot of things inside I'm trying to figure
out what
they are [Music]
fat is that pops um belly they have something
like pork belly okay crunchy okay okay yo
you need to mix it with rice too I think makes
it rice it tastes better yeah get some more
rice
how's it hungry yeah very nice so what is
this I think it's better if I tell you after
dinner okay
that's okay
you know you know what it is right yes okay
so now later now it's okay okay so crispy
seasick basically seasick because Filipinos
they like to utilize all parts of animals
so this part is Big it's big it actually picks
face pick yeah it's a chick and ears okay
yeah okay oh no Bean
that's okay right we eat beef cheek as well
so big cheese okay it's very nice I think
for your mother because your mother is Asian
wow it's so common apparently don't tell him
it's okay
dip this one because I don't know what salt
it is
spicy no that's what I'm told what home anyway
you pronounce that yeah yeah it's nice no
not spicy at all [Music]
yeah guys so you can see now lightning and
thunder on the day when I'm out and my mom
arrives yeah BGC at night it's quite pretty
sometimes and lots of the times and I think
when it's not raining more touristy people
in the afternoon could stand here and just
look at a big TV oh yeah yeah it's not the
killer yeah yeah yeah it's the best spot to
look
[Music] it's very funny
so yeah this is the most iconic spot of BGC
just by seeing the CV and they keep updating
the ads uh every maybe every two weeks you
think different ads [Music] so left side this
is uh Shangri-La yeah I checked it but it
was so too expensive some foreigners they
actually stay here for a long time and they
they just book hotel like a normal apartment
I think they had two parts one is residence
one is Hotel because Alina she takes sometimes
takes English class here inside and her teacher
lives inside oh wow there is something like
a Costco here oh yeah SNR yeah you want to
go and have a look yeah I'll show you what
we why we think like prices yeah yeah yeah
how much was it 700 yeah yeah it was quite
quite good good price 700 pesos so they like
Costco so there's a big portion about buy
yeah usually but of course we cannot buy like
a lot oh yeah so there's some muffins here
too actually you know for muffins for us it's
like breakfast right for her it's dessert
muffins no I don't I can't I can't have it
anymore because like after you left so Jason
doesn't like to eat muffin so when When Auntie
Lisa she my sister younger sister when when
she bought like usually Costco is ten dollars
for two bucks very very cheap and also two
bucks two boxes a box of six the two boxes
12 pieces 370 for two boxes yeah big muffins
big and so good but then after he left because
if I have one boss at six I I control myself
one week I only eat one maybe like almost
two months to finish sixth muffin yeah and
a few times I pack I packed this is
so then now I know like Lisa asked me do you
want my mother said no if we buy then we buy
only six pieces and it's only for two or three
days oh also quick to eat two each day yeah
yeah sometimes sometimes morning but usually
we share one as you can see many many um like
security many shopping malls in front there
are security guards so usually in the Philippines
everywhere you go every shopping center entrance
so yep yeah everywhere
Philippines has a lot of American influence
so many of the things for example the food
habits fast food chains many of them are influenced
by Americans anything you see Costco I think
it's an hour itself is American brand we can
go to a fruit session to see compared with
prices in Australia I think that's the most
interesting part for me get your wine here
yeah oh yeah oh they have nitrogen I didn't
know that this is the face cream brand I use
no
the change to um it changed a long time already
into another brain I see so on our way back
home now we're back at SNR one of our favorite
shopping centers to show my parents local
shopping experience I think it'll be quite
interesting for them to compare the prices
here in the Philippines with Australia and
see how what what's the difference mainly
but I think so far the impression which is
it looks like a Costco which if you guys know
Costco is just a how do they describe Costco
it's like a bulk purchase it was a giant um
like a supermarket Warehouse yeah wholesale
yeah then you everything is big in portion
like bulk purchase so I should bring it in
from America yeah American Iron company okay
so yeah the fruits here they compare with
the prices we can have a look it's quite expensive
here yeah always on the phone I always told
her it's like oh I'm fruity and SNR they're
so expensive because most of most of them
are Imports you know I think if you buy local
streets and of course it'll be cheaper oh
we just had this one hmm what is this
yeah in Chinese Islam tea is I don't know
what's the English name of it and they've
got black corn as well and usually like if
I have a fruit session usually we buy the
roast chicken there the chicken here is very
tasty you know Australia Supermarket they
have chickens this one has a lot of juice
inside so it's very tasty and it's cheap 300
pesos so one meal for two people already yeah
like Costco so Costco is about seven dollars
per chicken is very nice yeah especially Philippines
some of these minutes oh yeah filippi chicken
if you in the Philippines we naturally to
let you try the grilled chickens here because
I think Philippines something called in NASA
which they use a special sauce on Top chicken
it's very delicious
all right so after SNL we came back to our
apartment and just gonna give up my mom and
Joe a room tour of our apartment they would
be staying here for the last seven months
it's our first time seeing this as well so
this is actually in Pikachu yeah in BGC so
it was very convenient from British system
walking to here only take a couple of minutes
for the next 10 days oh awesome
all right so um so no no nice nobody Disturbed
so under there that's the playground and also
swimming pool downstairs all right so um yeah
Welcome to our apartment okay our cozy little
apartment yep wow so it's not very big it's
uh yeah that's the word cozy guys so yeah
I guess this is a typical BTC apartment here
Manila I love all the plants yeah the plants
looks beautiful oh did you draw it yeah really
we went to drawing class which which one Justin
I don't know I can see the name sorry
why are you so scared
Alina draw this one and just into this one
it's true yeah when the drawing class together
so they sketch a lot of things and then we
just paint yeah and they help us a little
bit as well so yeah this is the view from
our apartment wow
oh yeah it's quite glitch it's open really
beautiful yes I think the night view yeah
and you can always see like some office workers
usually work there until like three or four
a.m really yeah next building yeah sometimes
when we're going to meet up now let's look
at a window and see a bunch of office workers
see on the computers or in a meeting this
is our we call it grucha Hi how are you Philippines
this is not more there is yeah I still don't
want to send this one so uh for drinking yes
for drinking so this is uh like tapped water
I guess not like not better than the tap water
I guess okay you cannot drink water from tap
here they say in BGC you can
okay so with this one you don't oh no I mean
they say it's drinkable many people Filipinos
say it's drinkable but just for our safety
we prefer and but they they said this one
is not a lot better too so I don't know okay
room
bedroom
so this bedroom has three lights oh oh they've
changed yeah another pet here yeah that's
nice yeah so there's a workspace not room
and everything okay big screen Queen yep Queen
yeah in this bed it's um yes Queen [Music]
so if I move a little bit Alina would wake
up immediately so sensitive sleeper latency
is very thin player Oh see it's only like
this oh no wonder so that's why because of
the mattress maybe yeah it's okay I mean because
you have you always have to move it's okay
I'm used to it already yeah I'm used to it
already I only want to know one thing who
sleeps at the window in oh yes guess yeah
I do oh you I step inside all right yeah but
then you wake up then you you wake Elena's
up exactly but but she said she doesn't like
to be in between something oh yeah the wall
so I sleep there just to always push me [Laughter]
is it is that the reason yeah oh I'll just
sleep more on this side because 
I like sleep on the side too you know [Laughter]
[Music] yeah 
it's aesthetic [Music]
