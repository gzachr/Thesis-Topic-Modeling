hey guys welcome to uh the filipino american 
ministry podcast i'm your host henrik and this is  
our host co-host aaron and our guest neo so i hope 
you enjoy where our topic for today is going to be  
is it unbiblical to be a filipino-american church  
all right welcome everybody so um as your co-host 
i'm going to be asking henrik the first question  
so let's start with this first question 
how do we define a filipino-american church  
yeah that's a good question um yeah i think 
there's there's one main one which is uh  
the church is predominantly filipino-american 
the pastor is filipino uh from the philippines  
and then all of them wait wait wait 
wait so you're saying you can't have a
does it have to be a filipino from the philippines 
well i'm just giving the majority filipino  
church what what does the main ones look like all 
right yeah and then so yeah filipino uh pastor  
from philippines and then it probably has the 
word filipino in their name uh or philippines  
in their name so those are typical ones the other 
ones are maybe less popular as a second generation  
filipino american and he's attracting other 
filipino americans in his congregation  
yeah but basically what we're talking 
about is a church that is mainly majority  
filipino-american do you have anything else to 
add aaron yeah um yeah like i said i think um
culturally it's you can tell it's 
filipino or filipino-american  
right like you go in there and just after 
the service there's olympia and panzer  
yeah whatever like filipino food that's just 
structured in a way that's very filipino  
um the way people relate to each other the way 
people talk um respect uh to like older people  
you can kind of just see that when you go in 
there and i think also other than that it's um  
the missiological focus i guess like people 
are the focus is on reaching out mostly to  
i mean i guess they don't really like outright 
say that they're focusing mainly on filipinos  
but because that's kind of like their circle of 
influence that's who they reach out mainly to  
yeah naturally they uh reach out 
to other filipino-american friends  
yeah all right i guess uh it's a good 
time to switch to the next question  
what does the bible have to say 
about filipino-american churches  
well i think to start off i think we need to 
look at what does the bible say about ethnicity  
and i think one thing we can say is that 
god is a god of uh culture like he he has  
created many people uh many people groups in his 
image and there are different culture groups right  
yeah yeah so i think uh i don't think our god is 
a god who doesn't like diversity or he doesn't  
like culture um but he does um he created all 
the different culture groups he loves them all  
and we can see that in the arc of the story of 
the gospel and how god has he chose israel but  
then he now he is reaching even jew and gentile 
to bring them to him and in revelations we see  
all these nations tribes and tongues worshiping 
god together so i think that's the first thing  
that we can say about filipino-american 
churches yeah do you have anything to add um
well definitely i think there is room for i'm just 
trying to think about this question does the bible  
have to say about filipino-american churches i 
don't know if there is a like a specific thing  
that it says about filipino-american churches 
maybe i think the more appropriate question is  
like is there room for america filipino-american 
churches and i would definitely say yes to that  
i think there is room for immigrant churches in 
general i think that like even in the bible you  
see that god pursues specific people groups um 
you know like jonah to the people of nineveh or  
paul to the gentiles um it's not that 
you know we're leaving out the majority  
or other cultures it's just that it's one 
way to reach all the nations sometimes  
um god sends us to a specific people group so 
i think you know that's probably the role of um  
some i mean that's probably the role of um 
immigrant churches in general so like you  
know filipino americans are best equipped 
to reach out to filipino americans and so  
it's again it's not that you know we're trying to 
ignore other cultures i mean not really it's just  
that if you really think about it it's kind of 
um wiser actually to um have filipino americans  
or a specific culture reach out to the same 
culture it's just a lot easier that way i think
yeah so that you're thinking of uh like 
practically speaking it's easy for it's easier for  
uh filipino americans to reach out to other 
filipino americans yeah that's true but also  
like even like just looking in the bible um i mean 
god does have a heart for specific people groups  
right and again not taking away from from our call 
to reach all the nations right i think i i mean  
that's the calling that we all that we should 
try to fulfill right to reach all the nations  
um but the way that i see it is it's not in 
contrast against like targeting a specific  
people group i'm looking at targeting a specific 
people group as a means to target all nations
yeah yeah yeah that sounds like um epic 
have you heard of epic i think so i've  
heard a little bit about them yeah we went to 
their conference yeah epic i remember hearing  
their vision is uh they're an ethnic uh not 
ethnic but they're focused on asian americans  
um but when the in their vision uh what their 
goal is is they're trying to reach the world  
through asian americans so i thought that 
was uh yeah that's in line with what you said
yeah i think i mean i'm not like even if you 
think about like uh strategy and reaching out um  
the unreached right it's not like you 
don't say oh i'm gonna go out and reach it  
like everybody it's just like a silly strategy 
it just doesn't work right like usually you  
you pick a people group you pray about it 
you learn the language you learn the culture  
and uh you know and and you start with 
that and that it doesn't make sense  
um be so broad i think it's kind of like 
it's not effective basically yeah you're  
you're talking about missions right like 
if yeah like in the context of missions  
so like in the same way there is a there 
is a gap you know that the majority  
christian culture where they can't reach uh 
filipinos or filipino-americans just because  
you know they don't uh it's not their circle of 
influence they don't understand the culture or or  
maybe just the language even the filipinos speak 
english sometimes you know filipinos especially  
first generation they're kind of shy to speak 
english uh you know they say nosebleed nosebleed
there's a class speak english yeah there's 
a classic example in my church where  
someone was coming from work she came to a bible 
study and then there were people there who didn't  
speak tagalog and then what happened was they 
said oh you can't you guys can't speak tagalog  
you guys have to speak english because there's 
a non-tagalog speaker here and then she said  
oh i'm so tired of speaking english because she 
spoke english all day i think i know who that is  
yeah so yeah even though filipinos speak 
english or they're good at it that doesn't  
mean that they're comfortable speaking it all 
the time or that it's not a the preference of  
it's not their heart language basically yeah 
yeah yeah i mean we have to kind of adjust  
somehow yeah and i think that's the value 
of filipino-american churches because  
they allow people to communicate in 
their heart language like their struggles  
and their their concerns and they can talk 
to someone and hear um like feel the love  
of god through people in their culture so i think 
that's another value of filipino-american churches
so do you think there are benefits or advantages 
of you know being a filipino-american church
or their advantages or ethnic 
church in general like what  
are what advantages are there to being an ethnic 
church specifically filipino-american church  
yeah so i think uh yeah kind of like what you said 
like it's it's it has a missional advantage where  
you can reach certain people that you wouldn't be 
able to reach like in my region there are a lot of  
filipino americans that are immigrating here and a 
lot of them actually my church grew a lot because  
there were people who were visiting our church 
because they saw us online they were looking  
for a filipino church and yeah they were looking 
specifically for a filipino church a lot of our  
members we asked them how did you who invited you 
here and they said i was looking for a filipino  
church and sometimes it's because they're looking 
for filipino community because they're immigrants  
and um i think even for me uh when i go 
to uh when i go to a region of the country  
i visit try to visit filipino american churches 
um yeah it's not that i don't like like a majority  
or multi-ethnic churches but i'm also like 
curious to see when i visit other states  
like i'm curious to to look at i feel at home in 
some way when i go to filipino-american churches  
yeah no i think i mean i think you're right 
about that definitely for me and my family when  
we moved to the states the first thing we tried 
to look for was a you know a filipino church um  
it's the first place where we can find community 
you know people that you know where you were  
it's a new land it's a strange land where we're 
not sure how things work and so you know just  
being in a filipino church kind of comfortable 
right like that's where i found my first friends  
uh first deep community um where i can eat 
filipino food so like it's a place of comfort  
um and do you know i think that that uh you sort 
of mentioned it already but that is an advantage  
because um uh i think um 
asian immigration in general  
it's not like it's slowing down or anything like 
that it's actually like increasing every year  
and so when you have immigrants come to the us a 
lot of them might not be christians a lot of them  
might just be looking for 
a place where they can find  
community or even a job right like job opportunity 
if they can talk to somebody who knows somebody or  
like a place to live right like somebody who knows 
somebody that's just how it works in our culture  
and so that kind of presents um an opportunity 
to be able to share the gospel to them i think  
yeah is it interesting you brought that up 
because i actually i have some statistics um  
yeah i got some of these statistics from 
together for the gospel talk it says  
in 2012 um there was 18.9 million asian 
americans and it's expected to double by 2050  
and they say that it's expected that 10 
of the us will be asian american by 2050.
and then and on top of that asian american growth 
rate is estimated to exceed all other ethnic  
racial groups in america so there is definitely 
a lot of asian americans coming to america and so  
yeah like you said there's a there's a there's 
a strategic purpose for um filipino-american  
churches or asian-american churches in general to 
minister to these immigrants who are coming here
yeah yeah um let's uh switch a little bit and 
talk about what are what about like disadvantages
yeah disadvantages i think the main 
disadvantage um why immigrant churches are  
criticized is because they seem to be like 
a cultural bubble where they're not really  
reaching out to their community if 
it's like a filipino-american church  
a lot of criticism that happened in my church is 
like we are located in a city but we're not really  
interacting with our community we just interact 
with each other other filipinos in the community  
but not interacting with um non-filipinos and 
we also have non-filipino co-workers friends  
and how do we like how is our church going 
to minister to them because when we like  
i had this issue when i was young i had a 
chinese friend and i invited him to my church  
and i also invited his family to my church but 
there was like a cultural gap and it felt awkward  
for when i visited or when they visited so so 
ever since that experience i've always been  
having a hard time inviting my friends 
to my church i usually like try to  
have ta um share the gospel with them and then 
encourage them to go to a church that i know of  
so that's a that's a whole another issue um yeah 
i could definitely see that i think like because  
it's so monocultural it's easy for like others 
outside of the culture to feel out of place
yeah yeah especially if you're a visitor and 
you're not filipino and you're at that church  
you're gonna feel like oh i don't belong here 
uh hello everybody we got our guest here we're  
talking about uh filipino american churches 
we were sort of talking about this subject  
last time we were talking so i thought you know 
be great to bring you here cool yeah um so you  
know we we were just talking about the advantages 
and disadvantages of ethnic churches specifically  
i guess like filipino-american church since 
that's kind of the context that we grew up in  
okay you know so uh so yeah any any thoughts 
about that well i mean i always have thoughts uh
i think i don't know i think we talked about it 
last time right like yeah there are advantages  
and disadvantages you said you gained something 
but you also lose something when you become like  
a multi-ethnic church and i get that but um let 
me let me uh put the context so henrik understands  
so we were talking about this church that 
was a language church but became but is  
trying to become multicultural and so they're 
losing the the language church aspect of it
uh they're gaining something like you know 
becoming more multicultural i think we're  
talking about this right like the the danger of 
uh the disadvantage of of uh a language church  
is that it's monocultural that when someone from 
majority culture comes in they feel out of place  
right so in a way like right when when when the 
language church becomes a a multicultural church  
they open up more to the community around them so 
that's kind of like what they gain but what they  
lose is the advantage that we're talking about 
that like you know immigrant the immigration  
in the us of asians and asians in general is 
not going down it's actually rising up and  
like it's telling in my story that like the first 
place i go to the fine community is the filipino  
church that's where i try to find people i can be 
comfortable with i can speak my language i can eat  
filipino food i can find a job i can find a place 
to live in because you know just because i um  
maybe my cousin knows somebody there whose uncle 
owns something and that's just kind of like how  
it works in our in asian american contexts or in 
the filipino american context so uh so anyways  
that's kind of the the context i was telling 
i was telling neo that like yeah i think it's  
you lose something in the sense of being of the 
advantage of being an ethnic church right you and  
you gain something of being a multicultural 
but i guess it's like a trade-off right
yeah yeah does that make sense yeah 
yeah i think the i think you you know
with multicultural churches like i just 
i just see the the church if it's if it's  
you know if if the language is understood 
by everybody that's just my my thing is like
it just happens like the multicultural 
aspect of the pre like the preaching of  
the gospel if it's understood in us in 
a language it just culture culture just  
multicultural stuff just happens like there 
will be different people like uh different  
ethnicities and just uh god calls you know 
all these people who speak the same language  
i think that's what i was that those are 
like where my thoughts are dwelling because
i don't i don't think i don't think 
that churches need to be ethnocentric  
even though there is a cultural you know factor 
to to life especially as an immigrant i get that  
like when you were saying what did what did we do  
when we got here we googled filipino church i 
understand that right uh for the immigrant right
america is just a it's it's uh interesting 
it's all immigrants but if if we all like  
if we all grew up here for for the people who 
grew up here that speak english and are are in
understanding the language in that way
it just the church just it just happens i i don't 
know how to say it well what do you mean by the  
truth it just happens what just happens like 
whether or not you're actively seeking out um  
ethnic diversity it seems like if you're just 
if you just faithfully preach the gospel uh
in common grace that might just happen  
whether or not you're actively like making a thing 
for it you know i don't know if that makes sense  
so you're saying there's a oh go ahead oh yeah i 
was just i was just gonna say i know a church that  
um yeah that that that happened where the it's a 
presbyterian church and the pastor he said we're  
not trying to be multi-ethnic we just preach the 
gospel and then and it just happens and then he  
also ministers to his current congregation uh 
whoever is there like if they're asian he just  
caters his gospel his his um sermon to those uh 
asians because he's asian but then if there are  
non-asians he also keeps that in mind and he 
preaches the gospel in a way that ministers to  
those people so he gets to know his congregation 
and then somehow over time his church became  
multi-ethnic so yeah but i think um or 
aaron were you going to say something no
well i think i think that's true 
i mean i think that can happen  
but i think uh there's also like culture is not 
just language i mean i think there are still like  
cultural ways of of worshiping god so i think 
for example if it's a filipino church and they  
just focus on preaching the gospel faithfully i 
don't think that they're i don't think they're  
they might not naturally uh become multi-ethnic 
because um their cultural expression of  
uh being christians i think they'll be able to 
minister to other filipino americans and um his  
their message will be like it's going to be the 
same gospel it's going to be faithful but it's  
going to be focused more on a different aspect 
that resonates better with filipinos for example  
shame like other cultures they focus on guilt 
and um so they're more when they hear the gospel  
in the with a guilt lens uh basically talking 
about how jesus died to take away your guilt  
then um yeah that's a different than from a 
pastor who's talking about god has died to  
take away your shame so i think they can still 
be faithful but i think that um they will still  
it's still possible to attract only a 
certain type of ethnicity because of their  
called because of the way that the pastor's 
contextualizing the gospel for his congregation  
yeah it might also help if 
we start sort of um define
it's always good to define define what it is that 
makes what is a filipino-american church are there  
examples in the bible or times in the bible 
where we see a focus on a specific people group
greeks and jews right people of nineveh
or yeah greeks and jews gentiles but gentiles is 
uh i don't know that might be like a mix of people  
yeah i think we mentioned 
barbarians and scythians before  
but i was just gonna say like it's it's good 
it's good you brought up like what is a church  
uh i just i just bought a documentary i i just 
was watching it right before you guys called me  
it's uh it's called the church and it's it's it's 
uh so far so good it's a it's a pretty good uh  
you know it's talking about the apostolic 
ministry of the church and and i think i'm  
on this part where they're talking about the 
foundation and the foundation is laid just once  
it doesn't need to be laid over and over 
again and whatever we had from the apostolic  
teaching we are now just like because 
the guy was saying what is it the melias  
is the greek word for a foundation i didn't 
take greek so i'm just taking it from him and  
then the the word the greek word that was 
used for like churches and congregations  
later was like pillars so like you know we're 
just we're just building upon what was laid by  
christ and the apostles so what what the 
church is it's the assembly of god's people and  
whether that be a cultural homogeny uh homogeneity 
yeah a homogeneous group of people or or a  
bunch of different people however that manifests 
itself regardless of what it is it's one new man  
it's one uh it's it's uh it's one 
new man in christ it's the bride  
i think that that's the more important thing 
about church that's the most important thing  
that that it's you know that it belongs to christ 
and that it's in the world but not of the world  
and regardless of what it looks like to the 
world it's it's a specific thing to jesus  
um i think that that kind of 
that should probably be the  
more the focus of what a church should be 
called like should be made up of rather than  
ethnic uh diversity like like i mean i remember 
we talked about like i don't think we should do  
like i i'm not i'm not under the conviction that 
we should do like affirmative action in the church  
like you have to have this many uh have 
to have this many brown black and you know  
this many elders in your in your in your 
elder board like it does it's not prescribed  
it in scripture it's not really taught 
although the church is made up of all  
these different peoples and cultures that's a 
wonderful thing to see but uh it it's something  
that is just it's just part of what uh makes 
up a church it's not the thing that makes it
this is a cool podcast i i'd 
follow we're uh thought we're  
we're talking about a filipino-american ministry 
that's cool man i'm cool with that called fam  
are you fam fam man fam i understand fam as 
founders alliance member but that's because i  
follow founders ministries but fam phil am i'm 
totally down with that i mean i i i i love that  
you know we that god made us the way we are i 
don't you know i don't despise that it would  
be bad for someone to say it's bad that god made 
me this way i i don't want people to think that  
you know where they they think they're a certain 
color of skin and therefore not not desirable  
or not you know not good enough or or something 
like that you know even even in the philippines  
the way like you know bleaching products are 
are sold it's like due to make you whiter  
so i mean there's i don't want people that 
think that like god made it god made us in  
he made us yeah we were fearfully and wonderfully 
made and we are made for his glory in all these  
different ways you know and and if that manifests 
itself in whatever church you're in you have  
filipinos filipinos are everywhere man it's not 
just in america like it's everywhere like my uh  
one of the guys who's at my church now he's a 
pastor from shanghai he said there were filipinos  
in his church in shanghai they'd always show up 
late but that's besides the point so you know like  
that we're everywhere you know and and i 
think that's that's just cool about our about  
our culture our community there's there's 
this joke that there's the question like  
uh what are the two things that 
you find everywhere in the world
filipinos potatoes and filipinos
i was gonna say dumplings every culture has a 
dumpling you know um but anyways i think this  
kind of leads us though to another question yeah 
wait i was gonna i was gonna say something about  
neo's thing go go ahead i think the question is 
it unbiblical to be a filipino-american church  
i think it is possible like like with any 
yeah i think it there there is times when  
it is unbiblical and i think the common one is 
when they're centered around a certain ethnicity  
um and it is it has that it has that bias 
to become unbiblical because or has that  
temptation become to become unbiblical because 
of that what you've mentioned neo that sometimes  
or a lot of times maybe uh filipino 
american churches become more cultural  
uh cultural groups or like social clubs cultural 
club yeah they become more of like a filipino  
community center rather than it actually being 
centered on the gospel centered on christ and  
there's this uh there's this phrase that i heard 
it's called the culture gospel swap where they  
it was coined um it was coined by this pastor i 
forgot his name but anyways he was saying that  
uh we tr we attract people to our church through 
the culture and then we we have like this bait  
and switch where now we bring in the gospel and 
then because they have no other community because  
they are looking for people who are like them 
they have no choice but to stay and then they  
say yes we'll be we'll join your church will 
get baptized etc but they're not really called  
to believe actually believe in the gospel so i 
think yeah in summary uh if the church is like  
i think every filipino american church needs to 
watch out for that where they need to make sure  
that their church is not just a filipino 
club where but it's actually um seeing how  
they got i think the best way for a filipino 
american church is seeing how does the gospel  
speak to my filipino-american identity and how 
does how can i empower other filipino-americans to  
um reach other other ethnicities and other people 
that they're interacting with that link i sent  
you about uh nine marks writing this that new new 
article they wrote about uh asian american church  
jeremy the state of the immigrant churches if you 
go down to the bottom they actually have another  
article related to it called i think like make 
sure they're not just immigrants but christians  
oh yeah yeah something like that i think but 
yeah i think neil you might be interested in  
that um they're they're writing a new series 
of articles nine marks it's interesting i mean  
on immigrant churches i haven't been 
following nine marks as much recently  
but i should i should look into that actually 
the the articles you're talking about send  
them to me i i think they didn't they have 
a writer who was actually a filipino pastor  
yeah i think the writers for this one are like 
mostly asian americans yeah so i remember seeing  
articles by a filipino guy and i was like 
because i saw his last name and i was like  
oh that guy's got to be filipino you know like 
yeah i think that would be great because like  
a lot of the the the struggles or the the 
thinking that's happening i i at least from what i  
see uh with regards to asian american churches 
are in like korean or chinese churches not i  
don't see much like um you know ideas uh you 
know exchange of ideas in the filipino pastors  
it's it's weird too like when when you think 
about asian cultures in general like like um  
like i was asking my chinese friend if he 
was going to send his chinese kid or his  
his kids to chinese school right because he's 
from hong kong his wife is from singapore and then  
uh like they're friends at my church like me and 
brian actually we're supposed to pray tonight but  
his son got busy anyways um we i was i was 
asking him if he was going to send his kids  
to chinese school and he was like i want 
to but it's just it's not feasible you know  
but i know other parents who are like yeah 
we'll send our kids to chinese school or like  
you know stuff like that um like filipinos 
i don't you don't have filipino school  
you know here you don't have anything like that 
i feel like korean and chinese culture is like  
very strong so even if you are an immigrant you 
understand like you keep some cultural heritage  
and it's it's a strong one for the filipino i 
think it's more like uh assimilation to whatever  
culture uh you're in which is why filipinos are 
able to like be everywhere one of the reasons  
i think it's like we can we can work anywhere um 
and we we go into the culture and we're there uh  
now whether that's a good thing or a bad thing 
i don't know but like maybe that's one of the  
things about the filipino church is it's not 
hard to have those like tensions that are like  
in the korean or or chinese churches maybe maybe 
it's not no maybe it's not like on that level  
because of how filipinos assimilate in a different 
way i don't know if that has any bearing on  
um like what we're talking about but it was 
just something i was thinking about yeah  
no i think i'm i mean in my i think uh asian 
american churches they have their own like  
you know different asian americans have their 
own struggles right like filipinos in general  
at least from my experience i don't 
know this the statistics for it but  
most filipino-american immigrants who come 
to the us are able to communicate in english  
right i mean there are some who don't those bleed 
nosebleed i don't understand english or i don't  
want to speak in english or you know i mean i 
definitely had my first my first year in the us  
where i'm still thinking of the response and you 
know people who speak english are already like  
talking about the next subject so i couldn't 
communicate because it was very hard for me to  
like think fast enough to know what to say right 
like i understood it but for me to communicate  
like to have a conversation it was very difficult 
and for some people that takes longer like i know  
someone at my church they've been here for three 
years and still very difficult for this person to  
like communicate right when it's like english 
so um but you know that might be on him and  
i think in general though like just most filipino 
americans do try and they do speak english um but  
yeah i think um filipino americans in general we 
have our like if it was like level of difficulty  
i suppose for us it's not as hard as compared 
to like an immigrant church that really do not  
understand english and don't speak english like 
i feel like that's yeah that's hard but still it  
doesn't i don't want to uh minimize i think there 
is still a difference uh yeah that is enough to  
uh warrant like a filipino-american church i think 
yeah i think uh definitely when i when i went to  
kcm my campus ministry i could see the difference 
i could see the similarities between our  
church experience but it was my first 
time to hear about english ministry  
because in filipino-american churches everything 
is in english except for the fellowship but  
the in the other churches they had a child 
they had a mandarin service they had a  
cantonese service they had an english ministry 
then koreans they had km e m korean ministry  
korean church ameri english church so i think and 
also i had friends like i would go eat lunch with  
their friends and their parents and the kids 
would order food for their parents in english  
and it was just like we would just be at chipotle 
and then my korean friend he he ordered for his he  
would ask his dad what he wanted and he would just 
order the food for his dad because his dad was so  
he didn't speak english that much so 
he had to order for his friend his dad  
so i can see how like if he if he's in the church 
too how valuable the korean ministry is and how  
valuable like mandarin cantonese ministry is 
so i think like aaron said like there's that um  
there is that the filipino-american church 
does has it has more of an advantage  
to become more welcoming and also to assimilate 
because they are usually faster maybe  
yeah they speaking english definitely 
helps that uh process yeah and i think also  
because american culture has been a big 
part of filipino culture too so like  
they know uh yeah they're aware of like different 
american uh pop culture like my parents they grew  
they were in the philippines but they know 
uh like abba and like what else dancing queen  
dancing queen i feel like they already 
have i heard the piano roll in my head  
yeah so they still so it's easier i guess 
it's easier for them to simulate especially  
in american context because they already have that 
um that influence from american culture before
i mean uh like i'm just thinking 
eschatologically that there won't be
like it will just all be together 
right we'll all just all be together
um so although there are languages now there's a 
i was i was listening to a pastor talk about this  
he was saying that in babel the unity was a 
unity of rebellion against god and the judgment  
was that god scattered them in a way 
that they wouldn't be able to unite in a  
in a in a meaningful way like that again so the 
languages kind of separate and geographically  
people are separated but what christ does
through through the gospel is bringing people 
together uh and then we'll see the consummation  
of that you know on the day of christ that 
the the the disunity that god uh you know made  
he's going to make a unity that can't be broken 
just like the disunity can't be broken now the uh  
he's going to make a unity that 
can't be broken throughout eternity  
and we have that now in the present in in part uh 
and we're experience we experience that in church  
we have that unity now even as we live like unity 
in the bond of the spirit right uh there's that  
language thing still so we like the gospel still 
needs to be understood in the language which is  
why i understand all those contextualizations 
but the yeah the filipino church is just  
everything's in english but but i do understand 
your your point there is still enough cultural  
i you know cultural stuff to make it a 
contextualized ministry that's what you're saying  
right here oh that was henrik oh yeah i was saying 
that too but um yeah uh i maybe i should also say  
i was telling henrik earlier that i think that um 
it's important to understand that when you focus  
on a specific people group it doesn't necessarily 
mean it's i'm not like saying we should be against  
multi-ethnic or like a community church or you 
know to all the nations i think that there is a um  
there is a place for reaching a specific 
people group i think you know god has a heart  
for specific people groups as well as you 
know we should reach all the nations yes um  
the way that i see it is that in reaching out a 
specific people group the one that i'm already  
uh a part of and i'm familiar with i'm helping 
reach all the nations by reaching that specific  
people group now again like henrik said it can 
become sinful if like your meeting is based on  
your ethnicity alone right i mean that's not why 
we meet but or yeah or if the if unity you're  
building upon is premised upon them yeah but 
i think it's wise to look at it and i think i  
mentioned this to you before it's wise to kind 
of use that culture as a way to reach people  
because you already know it right like it doesn't 
make sense to like broadly say i'm gonna reach  
houston or like i'm gonna reach america like okay 
well like what's the plan like what's the strategy  
you gotta start somewhere right like you can't 
just say like i'm gonna go to romania or like i'm  
gonna go to philippines if you're for example 
like a missionary you would probably say okay  
i'm gonna pick this people group i'm gonna 
study their language i'm gonna study their  
culture i'm gonna live with them so i understand 
them and reach out to them and i think like in  
in the us right like there is uh there is 
enough gap between majority culture and like  
filipino-american culture that there is a 
place for filipino-american christians to  
do the reaching out where it's why 
it's a wiser use of resources in time
yeah and i think um another example 
of that is like college ministries  
um their focus their their strategy i 
guess is to focus on college students so  
this is in terms of strategy you're 
focusing on a certain people group  
um but your vision is not just those 
people but um you know for all nations
all right i'm going to switch 
the questions a little bit  
and then yeah so what are the advantages 
and benefits of a multi-ethnic church and  
flip side is disadvantages and 
downfalls of a multi-ethnic church  
henrik want to take this one well i think the 
advantage um is seeing like unity and diversity  
like you can see how uh it kind of i think what 
i've read before i read a nine marks article  
about this um it was saying how uh when you when 
the church see when non-christians see churches  
that are diverse it shows that there's something 
that unifies them that is not ethnic focused so  
they're centered around something and that 
something can cross cultural gap cultural barriers  
and so it's a testament but if uh if if if we 
don't have multi-ethnic churches and everything  
is just monoethnic what does that say to 
the world it says that uh we're not really  
we're just like the world in that we 
only stick with people who are like us  
so i think that's the advantage of multi-ethnic 
churches um and i think the old another advantage  
is being able to reach out to your co-worker 
like i have co-workers who are not filipino and  
it would just be easy for me to invite them 
to my church if it's a multi-ethnic church and  
i couldn't do that with a filipino church 
because they would feel like a sore thumb  
like they would feel that they don't belong but 
if it's a multi-ethnic church they see different  
ethnicities so they feel like it's like another 
typical american setting like in schools they have  
different ethnicities there and so if you're 
in a multi-ethnic church it kind of has that  
sense of it's american when it's a a mixture of 
different ethnicities and just seeing the beauty  
of different how people different cultures worship 
god i think that's another value like if you're  
always in your same culture if you're always 
in your same church you don't get to see how  
do black people worship god or how do white people 
or hispanics how do they worship god what do they  
value and things like that so in the multi-ethnic 
church you can learn different kinds of stories  
that are not similar to your own um yeah so i 
think that's that's where i would start yeah  
that's like a full-page 
answer that was a good answer
um i like i think for me i 
would i'm just gonna look at it  
in one angle right like i would look at 
the question in relation to immigrants uh  
it kind of reminded me of what we were talking 
about how like asians who go to immigrants uh  
christians who go to the d4g conference it feels 
more like a going to jurassic park where you  
go and watch your favorite creature dinosaur yeah 
the dinosaur but yeah um have you been at p4g
yeah you've been yeah which was a contextualized 
ministry what did you go to tgc at all  
no i did i got the chance opportunity to go and  
help out but in the one in the west coast but 
i didn't i didn't get to too busy with school
i went to the national 
apologetics conference in uh  
north carolina and yeah there were not many 
asians there but uh but i'm okay with that
i i went to tgc 2015. sounds crazy saying it 
it's like well it doesn't sound as crazy as  
warped tour 2004 so warp 204 was a long time 
ago anyways i i don't i can't remember if i i  
don't know if i was paying attention to how many 
white people or black people or asian people i  
saw or like hispanic people i i wasn't keeping 
you know it wasn't like something that i was  
actively uh engaged with in my mind uh i think 
i was just there you know just because like  
it was it was just good to be in fellowship with 
the people who are there for the gospel um yeah i  
think i agree with like henrik's answer like there 
is a benefit to a watching world you know seeing  
uh like a unity that that's you know one guy from 
epic i remember one year i went he said that um  
it was like like one of the emcees right and 
it was just a quick comment before like one  
of the evening sessions he said yeah it's great 
because we have a unity that it's like we're a  
family and uh where it runs deeper than blood 
you know is it epic more like asian americans  
yeah yeah it is it's like all yeah so so like 
i saw a lot of chinese people and like a lot  
of brain people but he said like the the 
union the unity that christians have it  
runs deeper than blood it's the blood of jesus 
and i totally agreed with him uh so you know
you can see that in in in in 
that kind of situation you have  
just all these people who are who are gathered 
together they wouldn't be in unity with each  
other for any other reason other than jesus uh 
if it was not for what jesus has done for them  
and for the other people that they're they're 
with for the church for the kingdom the flock  
uh yeah i always think of contextualized 
stuff in languages that's just me  
yeah i um i don't remember where i read this it's 
like my friend's friend wrote a blog about how  
actually difficult it is so i don't know 
if this is a disadvantage but more of like  
a difficulty i guess so this person was just 
writing about how actually difficult it is to  
have a true multi-ethnic multicultural church  
because like i think he was talking about like how 
in his church like they have people who are like  
vegetarians and they have people who believe that 
like you know you should like only eat steak or um
basically it was just making the point that like  
when they do have like fellowship it's hard 
to figure out like okay what are they gonna do  
like where are they gonna eat and like it's just 
you know difficult especially like you know like  
people who are preaching there um you don't 
want to like offend the environmentalists who's  
like in your church like like it's so so diverse 
right like you have like this was like a church in  
california so it's like you have all these sorts 
of different people walking in and have different  
beliefs and so like just making a silly example 
about the the environment might offend somebody so  
so it's like um it's beautiful when it works 
out right like the when everybody puts christ um  
before their differences but the reality is there 
is some difficulty with it and you know maybe  
i i guess that's where like it's a good thing 
when we actually see it working it's beautiful  
um but i think a lot of people don't really 
understand right when they aim for like multi uh  
what is that multi-ethnicity the kind of um grace 
and understanding that you have to be able to show  
especially if it's like a different culture 
right like if there if there's actually like  
what if there's uh like truly uh not like a 
filipino american but like filipino filipino  
in your church and like a true korean not like 
korean american and like a sudanese right like  
you have to like learn their culture 
you have to understand who they are  
what's offensive to them right like just so that 
you could actually share the gospel it's not as  
easy as like oh yeah come here and eat pizza but 
the person doesn't like eat um or or come here and  
eat pork or something but that person doesn't 
eat pork or you know what i mean like there's  
there's actual difficulty that some people don't 
understand and i think we probably are not talking  
about like the extreme of like multi-ethnic where 
there is like these we're probably just talking  
about like multi-making the sense that like 
people who belong in your community but i was  
just trying to give that extreme example um well 
i i would probably offend an environmentalist too  
yeah but isn't isn't that what the gospel is it's 
a it's a rock of offense a stone of stumbling from  
people and it's foolishness to those who don't 
believe but i but god saves all sorts of people  
you know and uh it just happens sometimes 
people just walk through the doors of of  
churches sometimes especially in this season you 
know like i was just sitting down with my elders  
uh earlier in the week and they were saying oh 
yeah we had a wait a muslim and a roman catholic  
come in to church just because they they wanted 
to do something spiritual and their church like  
their their places of worship were closed right 
well the the catholic church was closed and i  
think the person who came with them i think 
they were like i think they're in a dating  
relationship they met on bumble i didn't i 
didn't even know that was a dating app but  
they met on bumble they came to our like what what 
what is going on but but that's what the lord is  
doing like god just brings people in uh yeah and 
and there if they sit under the preaching of the  
word like you don't know what god's word will do 
yes faithful i think no i think you're i mean i'm  
not saying again that it's a disadvantage of 
multi-ethnic church but i'm just pointing out  
that sometimes we don't know i mean we don't 
realize the kind of sacrifice we have to make  
to have that multi-ethnic church are you 
thinking in line of like like paul i became  
like yeah i like like thanks for these 
people yeah like imagine i imagine if  
i truly have a multi-ethnic church i i 
have to like know them know their culture  
like um right like uh if it's a filipino i already 
know like i gotta i gotta get whatever food they  
give me or else it's offensive you know you know 
what i mean like little things like those um  
obviously or you gotta fight over the 
check a couple times and then you settle  
yeah yeah so i guess what i'm saying is like it 
takes work to truly have a multi-ethnic church  
i mean it's gonna take work you know in 
whichever situation it is it's gospel work  
and it's uh where laborers laborers are few 
but there's a lot of work to do and it's it's  
it's plowing yeah planning the hearts of people 
whether they're in your cultural context or not  
it's going to be hard work regardless i think yeah 
yeah i think in relation to what aaron said about  
knowing your church i think that that's the 
um that's something that we need to do more  
of is we need to unders we need to seek 
to understand other people's cultures more  
um i think uh very often people will say that this 
church is unbiblical because of they don't agree  
with their way of doing church but i think um for 
example if you think about missionaries when they  
go to another culture and they share the gospel 
and then their church naturally rises um you have  
to like kind of like make sure you're not bringing 
your american christianity to them you have to uh  
you have to make sure that what you're 
giving them is pure just christianity  
and then it's kind of like what happened with 
paul also some christians were thinking do we  
have to make them jews first and then make them 
the christian but paul was saying no we should  
just make them be christian and we don't have to 
make them follow my jewish customs to be christian  
so likewise with missionaries and also with the 
multi ethnicities scenario situations you don't  
want to have your congregation and then you're 
you're you're unknowingly making them conform  
to your amer uh your your cultural uh expression 
of christianity so you have to be aware of your  
cultural bias or not bias but your culture the 
way you do church the way you uh what values  
you have as a as you're in your culture and you 
also have to be aware of what their values are  
and just to give a simple example is like time 
how do perception of time like if you're in a  
multi-ethnic setting there's going to be that 
struggle with the color people time where the  
the white people will come on time yeah yeah what 
did you say ppt cpd oh yeah cpt so you guys had  
colored people telling people time yeah so like  
yeah yeah so like like if you're a white pastor 
you can kind of feel like oh they're disrespecting  
me because they're not coming on time but 
then if you're more aware of their culture  
then uh yeah that's a very good example
so i think that's where it starts with 
multi-ethnic churches they need to learn how to  
understand each other's cultures all 
right so we've reached the hour i  
think it's about time to end so henrik make 
your spiel yeah okay i guess i can close it  
yeah anyways thanks guys for watching or listening
