decided to come here let's check the Vibes  
in talisai city which is famous for deleton here 
in tally sign listen food park right now I I am  
in talisai Liberation Park look how beautiful 
this square is and I came here by taxi it was  
um around 300 pieces exactly 260 pieces and it 
took only half hour to come here from downtown  
Cebu City now here The Vibes are just incredible 
my first impressions are all about these little  
cards guys how cute they're all around the 
city and they basically take you in that's  
it which is attached to the motorcycles so no 
big jeepney here but a lot of those cute little  
cards so that is the place where we are going

first of all we need to make a lap around the 
street around the beach I mean around the street

Street Food Heaven here a street food vendors

password right yeah Baseline people come here to 
Italy Chum for breakfast and yeah some of you told

line okay let's wait here in the line oh this is 
like guys a protocol there's a lady here taking  
the orders and after that you go into the table I 
was so disrespectful like I cannot believe I just

line always because local people love that atone

thank you so much for 300 pieces we have our  
beautiful beautiful with hanging rice oh yes 
please take me a picture can I have your photo
foreign
now the only unfortunate part is we have to take 
it to go because the music we have to keep it  
walking this way so you know what we're gonna 
have the best seat in the house anyway because  
we're gonna eat it the legend or Gladys is gonna 
eat the lechon with the view yeah but I think we  
gotta go through that right to to take it over 
here or out okay with the fresh air yeah yeah  
better better it's because there's too much music 
better decision okay because there's too much  
music and YouTube does not like that guys it's 
unfortunate yeah yeah oh here there's another end
this a lot of Grease look at my hands 
but you know sometimes deliciousness  
um no the rice it is main part of Filipino food 
in the Philippines they eat rice pretty much  
every day for breakfast lunch and dinner and 
this is so cute you will find the rice like  
this they call it hanging rice because well as 
you can tell it is hanging and I think this is  
platinum leaves so let's open my beautiful hanging 
right I've never seen this before it looks just so  
cute I wonder what is the right way to open 
that yeah that sometimes they like goes like
like but I also asked one day one lady 
and she told me to ungrab it just like  
this and look at this work I wonder 
who makes this like I would like to  
um see the person that makes this every day 
to secure their rice in here this is such an  
amazing word there's time people time here 
making this by hand and I love that I love  
um hand work so the rice it's sticky because 
I don't know in Asia pretty much all the rice  
it's sticky but in my country this is weird to 
see in my country we like the rice we say like  
loose loose yeah exactly so let me try first 
of all the electron without the rice let's see
um oh my God
wow
hmm
it is salty
perfect amount of salt [Music]
and the portion it's very that's a big portion 
that's a big portion you know for 180. you know  
what I'm gonna jump on in here and interrupt your 
video you know what it's crazy how affordable well  
this portion of lechona is in compared to the 
Rico's place you went to Rico's you can get  
a three a quarter a little bit big no smaller 
than this I think and it was about 380 or 400.  
yeah um you're gonna mix it guys a 
little bit of rice a little bit of  
like chocolate could you just make a lechon sushi
[Music]
no you don't want to try
come on try your tongue with me no he doesn't like 
lechon First Filipino that doesn't like lechon  
wow but you know definitely the best part is the 
steam I try lechon a few times already because in  
my country we have electron it's not so popular 
like here I mean for me it's crazy you can buy  
electron here in the streets that is amazing but 
I've never seen a crispy skin like these guys so  
um are you hearing none remember
wow
the trip was definitely worth it 
and it wasn't far neither 30 minutes
it's far to set up your mind and come here because  
it is not 30 minutes is definitely very 
short trip now let me enjoy miloton and  
Akash I'll catch up with you when I finish 
this flight now Chris is trying the letter I  
had to I said I was gonna save room for my 
video but I gotta try this it is too good
man that's next level good wow
it is just perfect right perfect 
everything that means it's so soft  
the skin yo the skin I wonder if they sell a 
skin like you know 10 10 pieces of a skin for  
something pieces I would buy just the skin I would 
buy like extra skin topping for my electron and I  
think we made it just in time because there was 
only about two electrons left and I can imagine  
that they probably came out here with like 
10. look at all the people yeah there's no way  
they only came out here with a few electrons 
yeah they for sure um prefer a bunch of them  
and this is where all the people eat deleton 
inside of the restaurant well they also eat  
the lechon you know on the surroundings but 
yeah this was amazing I want to go and check  
what else they have in there okay go check it out 
okay while you finish the letter a few more bites  
I'll wait for you perfect perfect so let's 
check the other spots well there's a bunch  
of music and you know Guys YouTube Don't Like 
Music so but I think they turn it off right now
