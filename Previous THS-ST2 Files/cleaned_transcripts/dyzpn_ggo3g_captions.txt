Hey guys!! Thanks for joining us for another street food adventure.
This time, we will take around Dau, Mabalacat City in Pampanga. 
Enjoy watching!!
Bibingka!!
Definitely love this! 
Bibingka is a Pinoy favorite dessert, snack or "mirienda" in the Philippines. 
It's a type of rice cake that is traditionally cooked in clay pots lined with leaves.
It's made fom "galapong" (milled glutinous rice), coconut milk or water, and it's perfect when paired with a salty duck egg and cheese topping. 
Wow!! Looks absolutely delicious!
Bibingka is also usually sold along with this Puto Bumb√≥ng.
This is another Filipino rice cake delicacy which is steamed steamed in bamboo tubes.
It's made from steamed rice flour or glutinous rice flour and served with butter, brown sugar, fresh grated coconut. 
Aww, you gotta try these too!
Bibingka and Puto Bumbong are very common specially during Christmas season.
You'll find them being sold in many public markets or around the streets, but are also available in many malls anytime of the year. 
Let's go around and see what else can we find here.
