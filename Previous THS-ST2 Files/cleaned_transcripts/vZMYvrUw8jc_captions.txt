OK~~~~
So, actually, Debo and I are in front of 
our Humaart (Introduction to Art) Class
initially, we wanted to go in
because Debo wanted to take some pictures
and I wanted to vlog the class
apparently, there are people inside
and quite a lot, right?
*nodded*
quite a lot
so we decided not to go inside
and stay in front of the class instead

though it's still early
right?

Ouch! there's even no wind
