What was his name? Catalina?
Catalia
Oh, this is the same mountain, baby.
When we went to Busai,
I thought it was the same.
What?
Bussai, but now you see, it's a little different from Bussai.
It really feels like a different area.
Totally different. It's different
I mean, they're adverbs. They love it.
I took pictures.
At the time, I used to go to your house.
It's better with mountains like this.
Eden's asleep.
Jangwoo Sidae
Jangwoo is sleeping? Is that why they want you to be quiet?
Drops of water are common among all children.
It's the best toy ever.
You've never played before.
Do you sell puppies?
Yeah, we sell them separately.
How much is it per head?
1,000 pesos (25,000 won)
1,000 pesos? (25,000 won)
That's very expensive.
Then it's one, two, three, four, oh, five thousand pesos? (120,000 won?)
But if it doesn't sell, it's not sold.
This fan is so cool.
They say there's no light in Joan's room.
He sleeps with a light.
It gets in the way.
My mom and dad didn't let me.
Only the lights are in the kitchen.
They've only installed lights in this area where you can see them.
I just saw this.
I deserve to say I want to buy a TV.
Still, I like being on television. Is it not?
There are pictures of Joan's family hanging on one side of the wall.
It's an integral frame.
It's stuck on the wall? I think it's Bonded.
No, the frame is attached to this picture.
Oh, no.
Maybe there's just a picture on the glass.
Daiyan? (Joan's brother, who used to work at my house)
It's not Daiyan.
It's Daiyan, isn't it?
No, he's a man.
Joan: That's my half brother.
Sorry
Why don't you have Joan's picture?
I printed it out before the picture, didn't you bring it?
I brought it.
Oh, there it is. It's in here.
Oh, here it is.
Isn't that your first family picture?
Yeah, it's my first picture.
At this point, they're all looking elsewhere.
Let's take a picture again today.
Jenjen's daughter looks elsewhere, and so does his son.
Don't rip the toy now.
You can ask Marilyn to help you later.
If you leave it like that, you can't assemble it later.
I was in the room talking to Joan about this and that.
Smoke from the kitchen.
It's starting to smell really good.
We're here.
Marilyn's grilling pork belly on this charcoal fire.
Thank you very much.
Usually this chicken isn't for food.
It's usually used for cockfight.
Because I keep chickens right in front of my house.
People in the city are like this.
I raise a lot of chickens next to my house.
So when I was choosing a house,
If possible, if the chicken is near the house.
I don't think you should choose.
Filipino friends heard the rooster crows.
Because I'm so used to it.
I don't care much about chickens crying,
If you're Korean, it can be very painful.
Joan's house is by the side of the road.
If you walk up the mountain path like this, you'll find a house.
Here, now Dad and Mom.
And two kids, living like this.
The building on the left over there is a kitchen.
And there's a bathroom back there.
You're not running away when someone comes in.
For a really long time.
Looks like he had a chicken in the neighborhood.
This is a 10,000 peso house (240,000 won).
Oh really?
It costs about 10,000 pesos.
And there's a bed in the room. He made that, too.
Bed?
He bought a cushion and put it on top.
It's made of bamboo or something like this.
Oh, $240 home?
One room, one living room, one terrace.
I asked him what would happen to a 5,000 peso room.
One of Joan's laxity.
The bubbles that Jenjen's kids loved, too.
It's really popular here, too.
Joan
Cut the meat?
Marilyn, are you okay?
It's okay, Lucas.
What is overcook in English?
Overcook?
Lucas, is this all right?
Of course. Me.
Cook the meat well?
Cook the meat well, but don't burn it.
What do I do? I'm already tanned.
Or we can just remove the burn later.
I'm already tanned.
It looks delicious.
Lucas, there's no handle on my knife.
There's only a knife.
Yeah!
There's no handle.
Joan
There's no handle.
There's no handle on the knife.
Joan, get me one.
