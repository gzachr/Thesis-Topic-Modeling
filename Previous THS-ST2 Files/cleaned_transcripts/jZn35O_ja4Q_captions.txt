hello [__]
my friends good evening good afternoon I mean 
and we are here with the boys we've got Yad  
ventures and we've got ali's Journeys here and 
uh me and the boys are actually going to be taking  
you guys with to uh take care of something for all 
of us which is filling the belly with something  
delicious and it's not just anything delicious 
it is one of the most well-known chains in the  
Philippines and now starting to be all around 
the world one of the fastest growing chains  
and so we're gonna be having some delicious food 
here they are known for their chicken apparently  
they're known for their burgers too Burgers 100 
yeah and a dessert and they're dessert oh geez  
guys this belly doesn't need it but we're gonna 
have to do it and so uh yeah what we're gonna  
go do is uh take you guys with us to uh head 
inside order some food honestly what's on my  
mind is a double cheeseburger right now and so 
maybe we'll taste test some chicken too but we  
shall see we're just a few blocks away let me tell 
you this if you're in the Philippines Jollibee is  
literally everywhere if there's not within one or 
two kilometers from you you probably didn't check  
the GPS correctly let's go oh are we gonna get 
a guitar plan oh playing on the on the road yeah
very good all right that's great okay here 
we are we are Jola B's delicious goodbye
salamat okay okay
fine oh bro choco mellow pie bro it's all about 
the chocolate chocolate you've been here before  
yeah that's incredible wow well this is going 
to be delicious we've got cheeseburgers we've  
got the Yum Burger cheesy Yum Burger chicken 
sandwich bro Yum Yum Yum a Cheesy Yum Burger  
a mini Big Mac oh guys literally my first time 
eating here I'm ready good good food Burgers
Ronald nice to meet you Ronald so you love 
jollibee's yeah yes okay I'm hoping I'm gonna  
love it too after today and Jeff's taking care of 
you with a delicious Burger yeah okay very good  
I'm excited to try it what did you order see one 
okay number one uh C1 chicken spicy or not spicy  
always spicy okay well I might have to take your 
recommendation I'm gonna try probably a Yum Burger  
and a spicy C1 yeah okay oh spaghetti too here 
they have everything we've got Italian we've got  
Filipino chicken and we've got the burger style 
so all right that's literally as good as it gets  
let's put it that way oh a chocolate sundae it's 
KitKat bits broken into pieces with also fudge  
and then the chicken and then vanilla ice creams 
and their vanilla ice cream is insane over here it  
just does not make any sense how good it is and 
they also just brought out uh I didn't see them  
they have crisp cut fries so if you're a fan of 
Crisco fries you have to get it so that means you  
guys know walidine that uh Jollibee is at least 
30 times yeah yeah I'm surprised I've never had  
it anywhere else I think they have it in Dubai 
right bro I think oh I only knew when I came here  
oh okay yeah you didn't know it originated from 
there it was everywhere exactly exactly America  
they don't have it have as much when you come here 
it actually oversaturates more than McDonald's but  
McDonald's and KFC are close competitor I mean 
just in McDonald's everywhere here yeah yeah  
and they got they got chicken too now so it's 
like how do you compete with KFC McDonald's and  
Jollibee exactly exactly it's it's pretty pretty 
surprising oh yes it is time they've even got  
looks like a little pie right there chicken a 
la king pie and uh pricing's really good we got  
59 so that's about just over one US dollar and 
so reasonable prices for uh fast food so this  
is great oh you can even get yourself a little 
points card right there 50 points equals one yeah
oh that's that's a proper meal right there oh yeah  
that's one that's just for you brother that's just 
for you enjoy it enjoy oh that's not a bad idea
I'm doing great thank you could I uh please 
order one uh Yum Burger cheesy yummy Burger  
uh yeah we'll do um  
we'll do with fries and then also uh iced tea 
yes sir and then also can I just have one piece  
of the spicy chicken yes sir yeah just one piece 
no rice yeah no rice just the chicken and then  
is that chocolate pie good yeah yeah okay you like 
them a lot yeah okay you want to have one too I'll  
order two for us if you're hungry I'll get you 
one too no okay all right just one then brother  
man I think that's probably gonna be it I'll be 
full from that yeah okay perfect salamat Jeff
oh that sounds like mine for 10 minutes sir 
10 minutes yeah oh perfect oh that sounds  
fantastic Jeff and we got Sheila como esta 
kashila I'm okay you're okay that's wonderful  
and is it cash only here or also card a 
card also 250 all right I love this guys  
this is why I love Jollibee one of the few 
places I've been able to use my card here
fantastic price there all right I 
think that means we're all set then
uh-huh you already know brother 
yeah oh yeah yeah very much  
that looks delicious that's the spicy you can 
tell by the color of it and so for uh 253 I  
paid that's about five US dollars that gets me 
a burger that gets me a piece of chicken that  
gets me a fry and that gets me an iced tea so 
really good price I'd say What's your favorite
oh the uh chicken yeah very very delicious
okay it's done then yeah very 
quick not even 10 minutes then
yeah
okay perfect thank you so much
good we've got it uh oppa that's not good brother 
where are we taking over what do you think  
one of these seats I think this will have to do 
so guys we have found the uh seating here and let  
me tell you this looks delicious we're going to 
start out by uh trying out the french fries here
the ketchup's good I'm gonna try the fry without 
it I'm curious if they put a lot of salt on it yum  
yum it does have a similarity between McDonald's 
fries but these are better they're a bit chewier  
tasty how's the ketchup the ketchup's got the uh
good taste we're thinking something 
like like you ever saying it's kind  
of vinegary because you'll find that a 
lot of Filipino foods and it's fantastic
chicken
no I feel like I want to go for the burger right 
now but I'm gonna go straight into the chicken  
and it's spicy so oh they're gonna have it without 
the gravy you can just see crispy crispy that is  
and uh mouthwatering oh there's the first bite 
first bite they always say is the best [Music]
that is a fantastic guys it's not like typical 
crispy chicken like you can really taste the  
breaded feel in there the spice is honestly 
pretty hot a little bit more spicy than some  
of the other Foods I've had in the Philippines 
but like still definitely manageable if you have  
a bit of a spice tolerance you can handle it 
and I think you'll like it it adds an extra  
you know kick to a chicken or anything 
when you have it a bit spicy you know
that is in honestly like I can't say like that I'm 
just always craving this uh like fried chicken but  
I do love it right but now that I've had this 
I'm gonna be craving specifically jolabies and  
uh we've got the burger in here oh there it is 
there it is the Yum Burger and you can just see  
we've got the cheese mixed with some sort of like 
maybe mayo and ketchup or something like that  
a bun so it's you know it's a simple 
Burger there's not any other fixings  
on there but it's a Yum Burger so 
let's see how yummy it actually is
my brother see you brother enjoy your meal
so we're gonna be taking a nice 
big bite we're hot here guys  
until that's how fresh it is and it's 
good it's definitely I'm not going to  
say that the burgers the best I've ever 
had but the chicken I would rate that
that is that I've ever had it's that good burger 
burger is good like I could eat probably four  
of these to be honest with you but we're on a 
diet plan so we're probably not doing it right  
bro we work exactly but yeah don't put me on 
camera no all right that was a very delicious
food thank you very much thank you goodbye
