little here to resort to some grocery
shopping later on we urgently need water

[Music]
once again so me a packet to resort now
was really crazy day first we got stuck
at the appointment for maybe four hours
it took really long and after that we
got finally to the mall with what you
can see from the mall was really just a
small part mostly the food court and a
few shops but the mall is really huge
you can spend you can actually spend
days in there I'm happy I found my way
out again yeah then the van first of all
as the line was super long at the mall
for the van through the mouth and it's
probably the fastest way to get there
with the van but also very uncomfortable
they are put so many people in these
vans that they don't start putting them
on top of each other is everything and
sometimes they're really small I'd
really trouble fitting into the seat if
you get an older vent just try to sit
next to the driver or the first Rover
where you have little space for your
legs we were in the second row and I
barely fit behind the seat and I'm not
that tall but yeah we have added to
resort now finally it's like 10 and I'm
going to end the day like I started it
with a nice dip in the pool
[Music]
and
[Music]
you
