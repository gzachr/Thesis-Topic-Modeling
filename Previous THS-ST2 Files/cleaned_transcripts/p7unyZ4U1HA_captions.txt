it's really not like it's really really 
nice and everything's really clean it's just  
it's a little boring in my opinion
so today i am off to bgc i'm actually gonna 
walk there it's like about a four kilometer  
walk kind of in that direction i think um 
not too fast on how i get there you know  
i love walking new places and 
exploring anyway so let's go
man manila is such an interesting city to walk 
through just visually i mean if you look at the  
living conditions of the places behind me here 
they're literally right across the road from  
beautiful high rises nice sidewalks a really 
nice side of the city personally i prefer walking  
through these kind of areas i find them way more 
interesting but anyway i'm having a great time
so this is a super nice area i mean the 
first thing look at the size of this  
sidewalk it's completely unnecessary i 
mean everywhere in manila it's just so  
densely packed in and it's so chaotic 
it's interesting to come here i mean  
it feels like there's absolutely no one around me 
it feels like there's no one here it's really nice  
well after all that walking i've worked 
up quite an appetite and i've just found  
somewhere that i want to have some lunch
so i have come to a really cool looking japanese 
restaurant the interior design in here is awesome  
i got myself a spicy pork udon and just like 
a couple other little tempura and some karage  
chicken i absolutely love japanese food and 
something i haven't heard for quite a while  
it wasn't cheap here i think i think 
i paid 350 pesos for all this but
thank you
yeah that's awesome yeah i absolutely 
love japanese food i cannot wait  
to be able to travel back to japan again soon 
i will soon oh man that lunch was exceptional  
really really good god i'm full 
i need to do some walking i think
so i've had a lot of people reach out to me 
and ask me to do a video here in bgc give my  
thoughts and impressions of the place and i will 
say it's really not like it's really really nice  
and everything's really clean it's just it's a 
little boring in my opinion it's just missing  
the soul that you find in so many other parts 
of manila you know i love exploring the little  
neighborhoods and just you see the people and 
the places just seem so alive but i will say  
this is a very very photogenic city so cue the 
montage of all the cool [ __ ] i managed to find
um
so it sounds like i'm being negative i'm 
not i actually do really like it here i like  
that there's a lot of green space behind 
me here and also over here and there's  
trees everywhere that's a really nice 
thing and i love that it's kind of an  
arty area there's lots of street art and 
cool sculptures around the place as well
oh man so there's this like building up ahead 
that's a giant it's like a giant mirror the sun's  
hitting it can you see god it just blinds you as 
you walk down the street that is a terrible design
so i don't want to make it sound like i don't like 
the place because i think it would actually be a  
really nice place to live i mean it's a really 
nice area there's great restaurants and there's  
a really good nightlife here because i've been 
out here before and i had a great time here it's  
just visually it just reminds me of like you 
could be in any city in the world i don't know  
maybe reminds me of sydney too much and i don't 
feel like i'm actually in a different country  
um
all right well i've had a great time walking 
around here and checking out bjc i've done  
so much walking today i've done 17 000 steps and 
13 kilometers of walking so that's enough walking  
for me for today but look i really enjoyed it here 
i had a great time walking around and exploring  
the place i think it would be a really good place 
to live would i want to live here not really i'd  
like to live i want to be in the madness of 
of being right in the city so it's not for me  
but i definitely think it's a very livable place 
there's great restaurants around there's a really  
good night life here as well you know i've been 
out here it was a couple of years ago but when  
i did come out here i went to like you know great 
restaurants some cool bars so that is definitely a  
real positive thing about this place so anyway i'm 
gonna wrap the video up here i hope you enjoyed  
i've got a lot more content coming i'm back 
to doing daily videos which i really enjoy  
and i'm having a lot of fun with it so anyway 
as always thanks for watching see you next time
so i'm about to do something that's really 
really stupid so i need to be up at like  
4 a.m tomorrow but instead i'm going to go out 
now i'm going to go drinking they make marge  
and some other friends i'm just going to stay 
out until 4 a.m and then in the morning i'll  
get up well i won't be getting i will still 
be up and then i'll go to where i need to be
all right well greetings from a hotel quarantine
