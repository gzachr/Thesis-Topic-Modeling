this did not go to plan when i was like it's 
going to get real bad it got real bad today we  
are in the biggest mall in the philippines 
and the third biggest in the entire world  
the mall of asia so apparently this mall 
is so big it has over 200 000 visitors  
per day yes per day this mall is so big 
that it has the biggest ikea in the world  
and an arena that holds events 
and concepts let's go have a look
so my name is josie welcome back to my 
channel or welcome if you are new here  
this mall is so big that we're already 
lost and we've been here for two minutes  
so i think that's to give you a little bit 
of an understanding of how big this place  
actually is okay so for the last six months 
since i've been in thailand and singapore  
i've been searching for a dyson era okay there's a 
dyson stall here so we're gonna check but i don't  
have my hopes up since they're never in stock 
let's have a look okay no never mind moving on  
there's heaps of different kinds of of 
stalls or shops there's some i recognize  
from home there's some i don't there's some 
obviously international ones some american ones  
so i would probably say that you could find 
anything that you need here very safe to say
so i was wondering why it was so cold downstairs 
and then i had a look and there's an ice skating  
rink in this shopping center what do you not 
have what is not here that is the question  
there is so many things um no one's on the 
ice right now it's getting cleaned i think but  
this is i think on the top level surrounded by 
so many places to eat as well but i don't know  
what else there could be what else could 
you put in a shopping centre at this point  
okay joke's on me after i said that we walked past 
and there was an archery range or like somewhere  
to shoot arrows now what else can they not be in 
here and laser tag okay well i stand corrected
so
so i'm walking on this food hall i have no idea  
where's drinks where's food where's what i am 
so lost and all i'm doing is looking for a drink  
there are so many options i honestly kind of want 
a coffee but i can't see i can't see where one  
is there's so many people here so it's not option 
that i can't even find anywhere that i want to go  
in a shopping center it is massive and it's 
quite confusing there's different buildings  
as well what we're going to do is we're going 
to have our sushi we're going to have our food  
first because i think we need some sustenance in 
order to walk around the shopping mall for the  
next few hours so we're going to try this sushi 
i've been craving sushi for so long and i haven't  
been able to find chicken sushi anywhere so they 
have chicken sushi here let's see how this goes i  
am so excited to have some sushi for the first 
time in probably six months the sushi's ready
that was really hot all right let's grab the sushi 
as i don't know what those green things are on the  
top it's actually pretty good sushi in australia 
we have this sushi and it's called katsu chicken  
and it's the crispy chicken inside the sushi 
roll with usually avocado it is the best sushi  
ever i know sushi's meant to be fish but 
that's just my favorite and i can't find it  
anywhere since traveling so this is pretty close 
this is just teriyaki chicken with cucumber  
not the same pretty close though tell me your 
sushi order in the comments below or if you like  
sushi pretty good but this is a dish that 
like i order a lot in australia it tastes  
really different i don't know if they do 
it differently over here or something but  
i still like it it just tastes like less deep 
fried if that makes sense so those two things  
cost 588 pesos filipino pesos which is about 
15.50 in australia so pretty expensive not the  
cheapest option we probably could have got cheaper 
options but i saw sushi and i felt like sushi
okay so there's a free wireless 
phone charging station here  
i'm gonna try it out because i need to charge my 
phone a little bit so let's see how this works
um
okay well that's not work actually i might 
just read the instructions please take care  
of your phone at all times remove phone 
kick up remove phone case while charging
okay i guess my phone doesn't support it
so there's quite a few different 
like sections of the mall like  
the malls are all different but they're 
connected by this like walk over this walk pass  
so we're just walking to the next one because 
we don't know what we're looking for at this  
point there's so many things here but this is a 
beautiful place down here where we were earlier  
and it's just got lights looks really pretty but 
they're all connected by this overpass and the  
footpath downstairs so let's walk into 
the next mall and see what's in there  
so this mall in particular this big one that 
we're in is like the cyber store the cyber one  
and it's basically covered in all of these like 
electronic shops there's cameras phone chargers  
little oh everyone's trying to get you to buy 
everything over there there's everything you can  
imagine sell things like phone sims everything to 
do with electronics in this one here so we're just  
gonna head around the back now i guess the water 
and to see what's on outside i think there's like  
some kind of like games or carnivals or something 
like that uh all i want right now is a coffee and  
i cannot find one because there's just so much 
around this mall is insane like so insane you do  
not need anything else this is a one-stop shop 
that's for sure let's hope i can find a coffee  
all right well i can't find like a coffee 
shop coffee shop because there's just too  
many things here so i'm just going to 
go into old starbees can't go wrong
okay we are stocked up on coffee and we're 
about to go to the back to have a look at the  
arcade games and the eye and things 
like that but before we go anywhere  
if you're new to my channel welcome take 
two seconds to press the subscribe button  
like this video before we go on that really 
helps my channel let's go have some fun let's go
we were walking around for 
a really long time in there
and there was just so much to do so much 
to see i think you need like literally  
a whole day if you want to come to 
actually shop and do things um but
thank you we're going across to the side um now 
where they're going oh let's go over crossing
everyone's so friendly so we're gonna go and try 
and find the big ferret oh this game there's rides  
and stuff too this is so fun all right let's go 
have a look what they have here maybe play a few  
games and go from there but this is cool this is 
insane there's so many people here and everyone's  
having fun i see people and little kids and 
actually even older kids on these two bikes  
like these tandem bikes as well riding around 
everywhere there's people playing like basketball  
there's people eating there's people on this 
what's that called merry-go-round i think  
carousel and they're on the bikes there's people 
everywhere this is really fun this is such a cool  
activity to do or like something if you want to 
calm down and just have like a little bit of fun  
like with family friends like anyone you can 
play these games and i see a big ferris wheel  
at the end there so we might actually go on that 
because i haven't been on a ferris wheel since  
the london eye about 10 years ago so might want 
to see the view from the top but this is crazy
i can't even begin to describe to 
you how many people are actually here  
everyone has like a seat on the 
cement barrier overlooking the ocean  
the water everyone's looking out over that way 
people playing games it's so cool to see like  
everyone's here with their family yeah whereas 
like if this was australia you might come with  
your friends friends probably gonna be half 
empty most people will be at home but like the  
whole family's out here like there's grandma's 
out here there's little kids running around  
everyone's having a good time it's awesome we're 
gonna go have a look if we can get a spot on the  
ferris wheel it's about to literally rain 
i can feel it starting to spit down so  
let's hurry and see if we can get a spot on there 
to sort of stay away from the rain for a while  
and hopefully have a look out over this water 
this bay this looks so pretty let's go have a look
five i don't think we have enough cash to go on 
we might quite literally be like one like nine  
pesos one peso short on going on this ferris 
wheel are you serious we need one more peso  
okay so we don't have we're like one peso short 
going on on the ferris wheel thing it's 300 pesos  
we have 299 it's 150 per person and we literally 
have 299 pesos like you actually have two in my  
hands 200.99 we actually have 299 pesos genuinely 
so funny oh well let's look at it from here
it means we can get stuck into some street 
food instead yeah let's go we'll spend our  
money on that all right oh hi hi so we're 
one peg so short to get on that so there's  
so many rides here so many fun 
things for you to do just so you know  
uh bring some cash but that's probably a blessing 
in disguise so now we can go eat some street food  
see what they have oh i can't breathe behind 
there play somebody see what they have  
maybe see if there's a little games we could play 
but definitely go grab some food to show you that  
let's go have a look at what they have that looks 
like a massive storm or like something over there  
so we should probably grab some food and leave 
before that hits unfortunately but look at that  
that looks that looks like a like a ski like a 
scary movie can i have this one the temp that yeah
thank you
okay so
i'm gonna go on the drop one um
okay it started to like really pour in rain and 
now everyone's rushing off everywhere and we're  
all trying to get upstairs and now it's raining 
everywhere and everyone is trying to get up  
and we can't there's too many people
okay that didn't work that did not work at all 
i consumed when i was like it's gonna get real  
bad it got real bad real fast you know what you 
were 30 seconds away from you were 30 seconds  
away from being on that while this happened then 
like what then what final destination you've never  
seen that movie before i was sitting there and 
i was like surely they're not sending me up like  
so there's so much storm now like everything's 
like being like blown in the wind i'm drenched  
my camera's drenched we're all trying to huddle 
under these like we're all trying to hunt away  
we're all trying to huddle under 
here just held off from the rain  
and i guess if it doesn't pass we just go 
home i guess sorry about i don't want to go
if this stays like this how are we gonna get home  
now all the power's out as 
well this did not go to plan
all right so while we're stuck here and 
literally can't go anywhere because of  
this storm um let's just get a little 
snack from this lovely lady ready
an oreo one twenty twenty
so i'm gonna try one of these we 
actually have some similar back when  
we're in thailand i'll leave the link on 
the screen or in the description bar below  
but i think they're like chocolate and blueberry 
this one's oreo oreo is my favorite i love  
oreos i'll eat like the tube of oreos to 
myself all the time so let's have one of these  
there's an oreo on the inside there's 
an oreo literally in the middle  
of the like pancake thick oh that's good okay 
we're soaked we came inside that wasn't the way  
that um that was meant to go we're meant to be on 
the rides and having some more fun but that's cool  
at least we've got a little bit of a snack there 
a little bit of street food um but i guess that's  
all we can really do everyone's running inside
