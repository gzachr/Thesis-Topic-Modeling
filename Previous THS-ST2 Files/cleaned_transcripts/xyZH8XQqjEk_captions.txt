Let's stop this nonsense
We are now in..
Nagoya International Airport
and now we are heading at..
Philippines
be more energetic
Davao, Philippines
This is the place where Jade was born?
It is my home
Our purpose is to visit her grandmother
our main purpose is to meet her grandmother
and we are going to ride Cebu Pacific going to Philippines
this airline is the first airline I have rode when I first visit Philippines
so I am very excited
what do you feel now?
I'm hungry
that is not what I meant
yes, that's it
our schedule for today is..
there is a fast food chain called Jollibee in the Philippines
and she's very excited
I'm hungry
she's always saying "I'm hungry"
are you a baby?
I'm not
what are you eating?
*Japanese junkfood*
it's so cold
yeah it is
are we going to show our ticket?
Cabin crews are tall
yes?
finally we are now in the airplane
yeah, it delayed for about 30 mins.
I think It's more than 30 mins
I waited for long and already sleepy
I am hungry also
I'm hungry
there was a trouble about the tire and delayed for about how many minutes
I am very glad there is a trouble like that before riding the airplane
I don't care what is the problem I just want to arrive safe
we can do this
our flight is about 6 hours
or more than 6 hours
let's not think about the time
I'm too ugly
we have just arrive in the Philippines
and we are going to transfer going to Davao
but before that Jade is going to meet her Tita and Tito
we are going to meet her Tita and Tito before going to Davao
it was fast to find
about seconds
let's go infront
they were talking for a long time
we only have few time before boarding
that's why we have to move fast
run
we arrive safe
we arrive safe but we didn't have time to buy Jollibee
we are just in time boarding
but we don't have time to buy food
It's sad that we didn't have the time to buy Jollibee
that's why we are only going to buy some foods inside the boarding area
what do you like?
I was thinking to buy cup noodles but I don't know how much
the price isn't written?
what are you going to eat?
Philippine's katsudon
it looks delicious
there is only few nori on it
delicious
are you going to eat katsudon in Philippines?
yes, we also have to try katsudon in Philippines
okay let's eat
let's go let's go
we are now going to Davao
finally we arrive in Davao
You said it first before me
I'm sorry, I'm just really excited
finally we arrive. it was a long flight
I'm tired
and we are lack of sleep
I only slept for 2 hours, and Jade is always saying
I'm hungry
her cousin said that she is going to pick up us
we wanted to find her cousin but we cannot find her
if she still don't come we have to go by ourselves
let's find her
the plan is to wait for her cousin but still we can't find her
that's why we search for a wifi to contact her
and told us she can't come to pick up us
so we are going to walk until Jade's grandmother's house
We are now going to walk straight to this road for about 2km
don't leave me
it was about hours that  I didn't smoke
I smoke before we leave Nagoya
and this is the second time
and also look around
same as in manila, davao has only few area to smoke
what do you call this place ?
it's like a place to take a rest
there is also some store around here
they told me that I can smoke here
I was surprised about this place
the chair is made up of bamboo
and there is a roof
it's like a garage
I am already experiencing davao's life here
those were the people who guided me to the place
it is too noisy
now we are going to continue walking
in the map it was written 2km but we didn't expect we are going to arrive fast
OUCH!!
