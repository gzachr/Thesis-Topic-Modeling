Citizenship By Descent for Filipino Kids
Do you have biological children in the Philippines,
and are you an Australian man?
The best thing you
can do for them is to apply for Australian
Citizenship By Descent for them, and they
will have all the
same rights as any other Australian Citizen.
This is their birthright, and you should do
it as soon as you
can.
Citizenship or Partner Visa?
Most people probably know that you can include
the dependent children of your wife, fiance
or
partner as secondary applicants in a partner
visa or prospective marriage visa application.
This includes
biological children of yours if you wish,
but seriously why would you?
Citizenship is not only a better
option, it happens to be cheaper than applying
for the child as a secondary applicant to
a partner visa
application.
Considerably cheaper.
Advantages:
* Child is an Australian Citizen
* Child doesn't need a visa to Australia.....ever!
* Child can travel on an Australian passport
* Child is under no obligation to travel to
Australia before a deadline.
No deadlines at all.
* Cheaper application
Disadvantages:
None that I can think of
Requirements for Citizenship By Descent application
First and foremost, one biological parent
must be an Australian Citizen, and they must
have been an
Australian Citizen at the time of the birth.
This isn't retrospective.
Can't go back and bestow Citizenship
on kids born beforehand.
And must actually be the biological father
of the child.
Doing the noble and chivalrous thing of claiming
paternity of a child you didn't actually father?
Can't be done, and must not be done.
In the Philippines
this is also illegal.
And you will end up with long term problems
at the stroke of a pen if you do sign the
paternity section on the birth certificate,
of which you will live to regret.
I don't knock an Australian bloke for wanting
to do that.
It's not easy for single mums in the Philippines.
Many remain single because local men often
don't want to marry them, and those who do
don't always
accept children that were fathered by another
man.
They can end up on the outer in a new family.
And
being "illegitimate" still carries a social
stigma here.
Kids should have dads.
I believe that, and I take my
hat off to any decent Aussie man who is willing
to do that.
However the law is very clear, and Citizenship
requires the child to be biologically descended
from an Australian.
How would they know?
DNA tests: They don't often ask for this,
but they can.
If they do so, your will definitely be caught
out if
you are not the biological dad.
Evidence at the time of conception: If you
were sitting back in Australia at the time
of conception and
the Filipino lady was in the Philippines,
logical tells you that you can't possibly
be the biological father.
Again, don't try to be clever because it's
their job to catch you out if you're not being
honest with them.
So what do they need to see?
Basically they need to see that one of the
biological parents (normally the father in
our experiences) is
an Australian Citizen, and that the child
is the child of that relationship, ie.
the biological child of the
Filipina mum on the application.
And they need a paper trail of evidence and
documentation to back this
up.
Please contact us and let us know, and we
can organize an application for you.
And your child or children
will gain all the benefits of being fully
fledged Australian Citizens just like you.
