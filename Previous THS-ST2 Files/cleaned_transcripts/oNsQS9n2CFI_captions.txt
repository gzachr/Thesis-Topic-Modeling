I love F too!
The lips!
The lips’ colors, the hairstyle
The skin, the face
Beautiful
He…looks younger
Yeah, he looks younger
You like the younger look?
Yeah
Yeah, but the most…
…beautiful part is the lips’ colors!
Wow, interesting!
Where are you guys from?
China, Guangzhou
Guangzhou?
These are six very famous Filipino male celebrities
And we want to ask people here if there’s one in particular they would think is really handsome, and why
That one, that one!
You guys pick F (James Reid)?
Why does this one look like a prettified version of you?
Like with those beauty camera apps, you know?
Like with those beauty camera apps
Really?
Like they smoothed your skin out
The eyes are bigger, the facial features are nicer
That isn’t you is it?
You secretly put yourself in the choices didn’t you?
No, no!
And then you hoped everybody would pick you!
I wouldn’t dare!
So you pick James Reid?
And you pick James Reid too?
Yeah
He seems the youngest
I like B!
You like B?
Yeah
Why?
I like his face here when he smiles, you know?
Dimples
Yeah, dimples
It’s a really friendly look
And then why do the rest of you prefer James Reid?
He’s really youthful
Youthful?
I think his skin is really bling bling
Green green?
Bling bling, his skin is really shiny
Should we speak English?
Doesn’t matter, we’ll put subtitles on it
Cool
Wow, alright, well thank you guys so much!
I really appreciate that!
Times Square!
Thank you guys!
Wow this is starting to be pretty interesting, guys!
Hey, Ari?
Which one would you like?
My pick?
That’s a tough one
But uh…
I have to say Enrique (A) over here
I think uh…
There’s just something about his hair…
He also has a really good face
Yeah
I don’t know, what about you?
I would say…let me see
F
F?!
Lot of people are picking F today, why?
Why, why?
Lovely and friendly
Ooh, lovely and friendly
Alright, lovely and friendly, okay!
Alright, let’s keep going guys!
This one I guess
D?
Yeah
Why?
Because…he’s got an interesting smile
It’s not only nice, it’s…
Not being sexist, like…
Like he’s planning something!
Like a snitch!
Xiaoma: A snitch!
Girl: yeah
He’s got plans
I know it’s not that positive but it could be!
Yeah, maybe he’s taking you somewhere nice for dinner
No it’s more like he’s planning something
Okay, cool
Xiaoma: Mr. Bad Boy
Girl: Yeah
Thank you so much, really appreciate it!
I think this one!
You think F?
Why?
The eyes…
The eyes?
So…
I don’t know!
Xiaoma: He’s like staring at you!
Girl: Yeah!
I don’t know!
B!
B! Why B?
The face looks natural…
Looks friendly!
Yeah, I think B!
I would say C!
C? Why?
Uh, I would say more or less the outfit
Probably brings out more of the character
Like B he kinda looks childish
A doesn’t give enough…
…just a headshot!
D…
Nah
E would be the next option
He would look like more a model that “made it”
And F is probably a singer out there
I mean, god honest truth
Judging everything, I would say that, because…
The outfit, god honest truth
I go with D…
His eyes, hair…
Okay
Yeah, I like F, his hair…
He has a nice smile!
C?
Yeah
Does have a nice smile!
Cool!
C!
C
I like his style!
His style, yeah, cool!
Wow, that was uh…
Really interesting!
It was actually a little bit different from what I was expecting
But, it really seems like…
James Reid, F did really really well
Also Xian Lim as well
I really thought that Piolo Pascual would do a little bit better
E, because…
I just feel like he has that handsome mature look that I feel like a lot of Americans like, but
I was wrong, I think people really liked uh…
People really liked that young, really youthful, boyish…
…sorta look
Which is interesting!
Cool!
