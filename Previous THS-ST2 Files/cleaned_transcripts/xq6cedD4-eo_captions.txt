Okay guys
Alright guys
I was looking for that amazing Filpino dessert halo-halo recently
You guys know it, it’s delicious it’s tasty
And I was looking all around New York City
But I couldn’t really find it
I went to this new Filipino café called Kabisera
And I was asking around, “do you guys have halo-halo?”
They were like…
“We can make it for you!” So they did!
And so they were able to make me a bunch of halo halos
And…we tried some
And they were freaking amazing!
And they kind of showed us the whole process of making halo halos
And they were really authentic and super delicious
And so me and John tried some, and we were like, damn!
These are some good halo halos!
And so…we thought, guys…
Here in New York City’s Washington Square Park
We got all kinds of New Yorkers, all kinds of Americans, people from around the world
Who’ve never had halo halo before, this amazing Filipino dessert
And so you know what, we got a sack of halo halo!
And we’re just gonna give them to random strangers today, on this hot day
And see what they think, because these are freaking amazing!
So if you guys want to check them out you can go to the Kabisera café
Because they were super nice for just giving us a bunch of these halo halos

Three two one go!
It’s a dessert called halo halo, have you guys heard of that before?
I have actually!
You have? Okay

That is…may be jackfruit actually!
Oh cool, alright

Oh thank you!
Mmm, that’s tasty!
Isn’t that great?!
Damn, that’s great!
Yeah!
Really good!
Good!
Have you guys ever had anything like that before?
I haven’t with fresh fruit like that
Yeah
That’s really tasty
What makes it…Vietnamese or whatever?
Filipino
Well it’s…like the fruits and stuff that they would use
Like for example, that’s ube
Which is Filipino root vegetables that they use a lot in their cooking
Interesting flavor!
Does Jollibee do stuff like this?
Jollibee actually does have their own version of halo halo
Right, but that’s sort of a less authentic version…
Or it’s not a full version…
This is more of a traditional one
Hell yeah, really good!
Can we have this now, is it ours?
It’s yours
Thank you so much!
Thank you!
So this is a dessert called halo halo, have you guys heard of that before?
No! Does it have acid in it? I hope not!
No acid!
Not really trying to do that right now…
It’s just really good…
Just kidding!
So it’s condensed milk, crushed ice…
Bunch of candied fruits, ube, red bean, jackfruit
You want to get the reaction!
Right, we want to get people’s reactions, exactly
Oh my god, I don’t know what to expect!
Should you get everything all at once?
This is like one of those videos!!!
It’s different!
Tastes like…it’s cool, it’s like tapioca!
Tastes like potatoes!
What?!
These taste like potatoes, taste one right now
Okay I don’t want to try that, don’t want potato in my ice cream!
So those are ube, which are a root vegetable
So is this healthy or what?
Girl: What is the string…?
Xiaoma: It’s healthy in moderation
Jackfruit maybe?
A lot of candied fruits in there
This is almost like a beet!
It’s ube!
It tastes like beet, yeah!
It’s kind of like a potato or taro
This is really cool, is it…
Cool, you guys like it?
I like it a lot, it’s not bad
I do like it, it tastes healthy
Yeah, for sure!
Is it healthy? What’s the selling point?
Besides that it tastes cool
The selling point is just mostly that it’s really good
Also, in the Philippines, this is their national dessert
So today we have halo halo
Do you guys know what that is, have you heard of this before?
Nope
This is like the national dessert of the Philippines
And what’s this called?
Halo halo, h-a-l-o
I think Anthony Bourdain did…
Had an episode about this
Yeah he did, he went to Jollibee
They have this in Jollibee
Yes, and he liked the Jollibee version
The purple is ube right?
It’s so good!
You were not lying at all [about it being good]
No!
Wait, this tastes like patbingsu, which is Korean
Is that the thing you get at the end of the meal?
It’s like shaved ice, it’s a dessert
I think I’ve had this before
They have red bean in it, and ice
It’s very similar
But we don’t use as much coconut
Oh coconut, okay
Coconut syrup
What’s this yellow thing?
I think that’s the jackfruit
Sort of thought it was pineapple or something
Where are you from?
Korea originally
Korea, so you might know some of these
They look kind of familiar
Might be something that you’re familiar with
But this is the national dessert of the Philippines
Xiaoma: And we want to see what people here would think about it
Guy: Should I open it?
Yeah, go for it man!
Big bite!
I like it!
You like it?
Yeah!
Refreshing, coconut…
The aromas, the beans…
The red bean, yeah
And the red bean, yeah
Is there anything similar to that in Korea?
In Korea there is
So, in Korea there is something called bingsu
Which is shaved ice with red bean…
And things like that
It’s pretty similar
Usually it doesn’t go with coconut or anything like that
This is more tropical, but…
Cool, man, thanks so much, have a good one!
Really appreciate it dude!
Interesting, this is…
Is it fruit?
Yeah, so there’s a lot of candied fruits, and…
Ube, and red bean, and stuff like that
Interesting
Yeah
Umm…
I don’t know!
I don’t know!
Too sweet for me!
Too sweet?!
I think the…
The texture…
I’m getting stuck on the texture
Like of the fruits, the gummies?
You don’t like the gummy flavor
Sorry!
I wish I could say I did like it
No that’s alright, we really appreciate it guys
Thank you guys!

Yeah, so it’s got red bean, jackfruit
Other candied fruits, ube
Ice cream
Condensed milk
Some flan as well
Yeah, I was gonna say that, it tastes like flan
It’s delicious!
It tastes like…I don’t know if you’ve had it, it’s called rice…
I guess rice porridge I guess?
Oh, like rice pudding?
Rice pudding, but it’s like…
It’s like a Caribbean, but kinda like an African dessert, in a way
It’s like a rice…
Yeah, it tastes like that, it’s basically rice, and we just kind of made it watery
It’s very wet, and you put condensed milk in there
It has that flavor
That’s awesome
It’s pretty good!
It’s a dessert called halo halo, which is a really popular thing in the Philippines
Alcohol in here?
No, no alcohol!
Damn!
You can add some if you want!
If it had some alcohol it’d be good!
What’s in it, is that chocolate?
Candied fruit
Ube
Wow, that’s actually really good
It’s good right?
What do you think about the flavor, have you had anything like that before?
It’s like real…
Like a cheesecake, kind of
Cheesecake!
Yeah
Real like…
Cheesecake, milky, real milky
From anywhere in particular?
Every place has its own regional variety, but…
In the whole country it’s really well known, it’s their national dessert almost
For real?
Here we have apple pie
This is the apple pie of the Philippines
This is good, I like it a lot!
Does it have a name?
Halo halo
That’s very tasty!
That’s…I don’t know what I just ate, but…
No, I’m serious!
I don’t know what that was
Ube, it’s like a root vegetable
It’s kind of like taro, or like a potato a little bit
Yeah, that’s really good
Is it sweet like that, or did you make it sweet?
That’s naturally sweet
Oh really?
That was good
Have you ever had anything like that?
Never in my life!
I haven’t been out of the country either
Never had anything like this, it’s very delicious
