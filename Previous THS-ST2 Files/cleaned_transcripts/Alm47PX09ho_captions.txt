things that filipinos do that is super weird

we get started our goal here in this channel is

if you are planning to be able to date

just to have some fun so this really video this  
channel is really mainly for all you foreigners 
out there coming to the philippines right  
um so let's go ahead and get started before 
we get started with the video i just want to

notification bell to be notified of new videos 
coming out because we'll be releasing three to  
four videos every week for you guys that's going 
to be valuable content you know for foreigners and  
experts that are looking for a filipina so let's 
go ahead and get started with this video so then  
first thing that a lot of filipinos do is super 
weird super super weird for foreigners you know  
is using an umbrella like you know if you're if 
you're in europe if you're in the united states  
if you're in australia you know when it's raining 
it's pouring you know we we bust out the umbrella  
we use that umbrella but for some reason in 
the philippines filipinos also use the umbrella  
to for shade even when it's like really sunny it's 
really hot you're going to see a filipino put up  
an umbrella and one of the reasons why is you know 
they're very conscious about getting dark a lot  
of filipinos don't getting dark because there's 
a stigma that if you're a dark-skinned filipino  
then that means you know pretty much that you know 
you're a worker you know you work in the fields  
you know they frown upon that upon that a little 
bit more so over here filipinos are super you know  
obsessed with not getting dark like you barely can 
find a tanning lotion here in this area spf 30 and  
all that kind of stuff with sunblock sunscreens 
you're going to find that everywhere here  
you know filipinos are you know taking pills using 
lotions using soaps having iv medication inserted  
just to get white just to get a lighter skin so 
the umbrella you know when i first used to notice  
that i said why are we using an umbrella in the 
middle of the summer right and so you're going  
to see a lot of that so just because somebody you 
know if you come here to the philippines you see  
a person you know open up an umbrella don't be 
like looking around saying hey where's the rain  
is the rain coming is it going to rain is it going 
to be a typhoon no it's just the sun okay number  
two things that filipinos do that is kind of weird 
to foreigners is you know over here the way they  
um let's say for example i say hey can you open 
up the refrigerator that's what we say in the u.s  
right you know they're going to say you know 
open the fridge right open the refrigerator  
open you know they're going to also the same time 
as use the word open the light they if you want  
to ask for toothpaste for example they're going to 
say you know can i get some can i buy some colgate  
even though they're actually choosing i don't 
know aqua fresh or another brand of toothpaste  
they call all toothpaste colgate um at the very 
same time as when they're ordering coke or pepsi  
and stuff like that anything soda is a coke okay 
anything soda is a coke for them so they kind of  
use the brand name instead of what the generic 
name you know they they use the brand name to call  
what that product is even though it's not 
the same brand um another thing also is you  
know here's a fun fact in the philippines 
filipinos prefer coke over pepsi right like  
they don't like pepsi as much as they like 
coke and you know this is actually because  
pepsi did something you know that was kind of 
messed up here they had one of those little  
raffle drawings where you know if you get this 
bottle cap if you get this particular number  
under the bottle cap and that's the winner and you 
make i think it was like a million dollar worth of  
prizes a million pesos whatever but it turns out 
to be that was the generic code where pretty much  
there were like thousands of people who had 
that code so there were these people that  
you know thought that they won millions of pesos 
turns out to be it was a mistake made by pepsi  
so ever since then pepsi suffered a lot here in 
the philippines so you know pretty much filipinos  
prefer coke over a pepsi the number two things 
that a lot of filipinos kind of do weird for me  
um is the you when you go buy a soft drink at a 
let's say for example these sorry sorry stores  
and you go to a saree sorry store 
which is those little mom and pop  
stores in the corners and you you buy yourself 
pepsi or or coke or um i don't know fanta orange  
soda or something like that or sprite or seven up 
whatever mountain dew when you when when you ask  
for that when you pay for that they actually don't 
give you uh the bottle um what they do is they  
transfer the soft drink from the bottle to this 
little plastic bag and they put a straw in there  
and they hand that to you right and i've i've done 
that several times where i accidentally poked it  
over and then it my soda just starts spilling but 
they serve you your soda in these little plastic  
baggies where they put the soda and they give 
you a straw the reason for that is because if  
you want to have the bottle you actually have to 
pay a little bit extra pretty much to cover the  
fee for that bottle like if you you know if even 
in the states for example you look at your um  
you look at the soda bottles or the cans um 
it's gonna say how much that is worth kinda  
so it's a very same thing here it's a deposit so 
if you want to have them serve it to you in the  
bottle you have to pay for the deposit now if you 
don't return the bottle you don't get your deposit  
back but if you return the bottle they do give you 
the deposit back as well right so that's just one  
of those the fourth thing that a lot of filipinos 
do are kind of weird for foreigners like us  
is everyone is your aunt and uncle right so 
like i've been to people's gatherings and  
means aunt and tito means uncle right but you go 
to one of these little gatherings and then you'll  
have a friend a filipino friend can say oh that's 
my tita lose that's my tita jing that's my tita  
baby that's my tita nining that's my tita michelle 
that's my tita all these different cheetahs  
and you're like how many kids did you did your 
grandparents have that's a lot of titas that's  
a lot of titos they're like no we're not really 
related but that's my pita so they call people  
tito even though they're not really related okay 
so don't be baffled about that thinking that oh my  
god this family expects to have like lots of kids 
so that's kind of weird for me to to actually know  
the fifth person is people like to stare a lot 
especially if you're a foreigner right and you're  
in you're in the philippines you're up and about 
especially like for example me i'm i'm five eleven  
and a half right i'm trying to get that actually 
i have to be a six footer but i just never did  
but because i'm considered tall here um people are 
gonna stare um at the very same time as you know  
like right now i have a tan going on but you know 
most of them i'm very very much light-skinned and  
so people see you as different and they will 
stare at you they're like you know and then  
another one is you know if all of a sudden you 
know you're quiet and you're walking you're with  
friends and all of a sudden you start speaking 
english and then your english is of course that  
american accent the european accent or australian 
accent people are going to turn around they're  
going to stare like oh who's this because a lot of 
people are not used to that not unless of course  
if you're like in the bgc area or somewhere in 
you know in in the more business areas of manila  
that's fine and everything but most of the time 
as people are gonna end up staring at you because  
you're speaking english or you look different 
because that's just how the case is they're not  
used to that sometimes you know even though there 
are a lot of foreigners here but it's still not  
where it's everywhere you go now the sixth one um 
i just want you guys to be ready for this let's  
say for example you meet yourself a nice filipina 
and let's say you just want to kind of rough  
it and stay at her place you know there's a high 
chance that they don't have water heaters it's not  
like in the u.s where we just have water heaters 
in all the houses and all the apartments and all  
the condos right here you know not every house 
has that and so you need to i always tell a lot  
of people when it's the first time that they're 
actually coming to the philippines i say for the  
for the two weeks before you come to the 
philippines just go ahead and enjoy and practice  
having cold showers you know i you know i 
had a friend who uh who came down to visit  
me here in the philippines you know you know 
and he's he's latino he's puerto rican and  
you know he was just like you know i can't 
handle this i i need warm water so he went from  
he went from you know staying at at my friend's 
place to all of a sudden ended up renting a hotel  
just to be able to have some hot water like he 
just couldn't take it i mean you know one way  
to one way that they do here in the philippines 
is that you know if they know you're a foreigner  
they know that you're not used to that and they 
don't have a water heater is right before you  
take a shower they will actually boil some water 
they'll boil some water and you have these big  
jugs of water if they don't have a shower or even 
if one person they have a shower in the house  
they still like you know have this jug where it 
catches the water and what ends up happening is  
you know they fill it up with halfway with hot 
water and then the other half is just a regular  
tap cold water and then you use this little bucket 
to to wash yourself off so at least it has that  
warm feeling and you're used to it right so you 
know be prepared for cold showers here i'm not  
kidding and just imagine if you know if you have 
to take a cold shower in the morning it does get  
cold here a little bit not as crazy as the states 
but it does get cold and the water pretty much  
adds to that now the seventh thing that a lot 
of filipinos do that is weird for foreigners  
is using a tabo um just think about of a scoop 
you know like you know a ladle or something like  
that so it's pretty much a a um this little 
bucket with a handle on it and they use that  
instead of toilet paper right you know so when if 
you're flying out here if you're planning to come  
down here to the philippines you know just make 
sure you always have toilet paper in your little  
backpack or your little purse whatever it is uh 
your man murse your murse your man purse right  
because it's possibility that you know you might 
come across where there's no toilet paper for you  
um so make sure you have that always on you but 
you know the way they do it pretty much is let's  
say you you know you sh you're done chatting and 
stuff like that you know all you got to do is prop  
your butt up a little bit from the toilet grab 
the little bucket with the handle in it put it  
in your back right there pour the water and you 
just you just go ahead and and wipe away with  
your hands that's why when you know filipinos 
were laughing at americans when we had that  
during the early covet stages when we had you 
know that run for toilet paper stuff you know  
that's what they say you know look at these 
americans they're they're running out of  
toilet paper they're they're running out of 
toilet paper you know they should know how to  
how to wash their ass that's why americans butts 
is so dark you know because you know you for  
filipinos here they rarely have problems of having 
brown streaks in their in their underwears and  
you know you you know us foreign guys look listen 
listen you know until you start using learning how  
to use a day or using a table and stuff like that 
you're never really going to have a clean buttocks  
all right so yes don't lie you know first of all 
comment down below on this video if you never  
had a brown streak in your underwear especially 
you white tidy whitey guys out there you know  
it's happened to you happen once at least in your 
lifetime so but guess what here in the philippines  
it's avoided lot because they're very clean they 
either have the table to clean their asses or  
or they have bidets here these little hoses next 
to the toilet and you spray your butt that way  
so you know hey nothing wrong filipino's got 
clean butts i guess right so those are seven  
things that filipinos do kind of weird for me um 
i hope you kind of learn something from this video  
if there's anything that you want to add like 
other weird things that filipinos do obviously  
we're gonna talk about the weird food that a lot 
of filipinos eat um but you know this is just  
seven things that filipinos do that are weird you 
know for foreigners it was weird for myself so if
