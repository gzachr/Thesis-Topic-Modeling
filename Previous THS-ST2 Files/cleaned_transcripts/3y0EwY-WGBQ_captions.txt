oh
houston we have a problem where has this
been my whole life it's beautiful
yo everyone it's godfrey hey hey it's
sophie and i'm challenging my friend
godfrey to make some persian slasher new
food for a day i'm challenging my friend
sepi to make only filipino meals for a
day meals are selected godfrey are for
breakfast he'll be making number bari
with a glass of chai for lunch he'll be
making kuku sabzi and for dinner he'll
be making nubia polo with tadik the
meals i've chosen for seppi are for
breakfast sepi's going to be making the
staple bread of the philippines which is
pandesal then for lunch you'll be making
arroz caldo for dinner seppi will be
making beef caldereta it's going to be a
fun one let's go
panda is filipino bread rolls and is an
absolute classic that can be enjoyed for
breakfast first off get a bowl put some
warm milk melted butter and egg
add some into these and give it a good
mix add the rest of your dry ingredients
and just mix it up once you've mixed it
up let it rest for a good 20 minutes
then you sprinkle some flour on a
counter and you knead the dough until
it's smooth once it's smooth put it into
a bowl and let that proof for about an
hour i have someone to introduce to you
baby it is literally doubled in size
this is probably bigger than my face
hello when it's good to go get the air
out and cut into small pieces then you
want to shake them into little balls
when you're using your palm then you put
them into the oven for a good 20 minutes
and let them rise
eat them when they're fresh out because
that is when they are banging oh that is
how you enjoy and cook panda i just want
to say i'm so excited to try this panda
sand and i genuinely want to mush my
face into this i know i've seen people
have this with just butter in the middle
so i'm going to try that first
here we go first bite cheers on
what's really amazing if you like
persian breads we are not really known
for super fluffy bread rolls like this
beautiful i'm gonna be a bit cheeky and
just do a quick try and put some like
nutella and peanut butter in
[Applause]
i'm not even just saying this i feel
like if you put anything in this it
seriously just would level up
normally is a common flat bread and it's
very very good to get first thing fresh
from the bakery
i'm looking at the recipe already and
i'm like
what add the yeast and warm water to a
bowl then mix it until it bubbles up a
little bit and then let it rest all
right so the next bit is add salt
warm water oil then add your plain flour
mix that and knead away
that kneading i'll let that proof wow
that's fine
now you should see a huge amount of
dough press down to lose the air then
divide the dough and let it rest again
time to make a quick glaze for your
bread which is simply plain flour and
water oh look how smooth that is though
stretch out one half across the tray and
gently make holes or a line across it
then apply that glaze time to sprinkle
the sesame seeds over the bread
let the bread sit in the noodle rack for
about 15 minutes until you have a golden
brown toe oh
look at that
it's a birth time bacon and it came out
all right eight enjoy with some feta
mint and some chinese all right so let
me just try the bread first oh it rips
up nicely actually
[Music]
i could do this by itself got a nice
punch through in the middle so soft
sesame seeds when i saw
[Music]
this wasn't too hard to make my outside
already oh how how but a combo with a
feta cheese oh
so good i'm ready to go to a persian
breakfast shop and just try one of these
and get fresh
arroz caldo is basically a chicken rice
porridge this dish takes me back to when
i was young when i was a kid and my mom
would make it all the time you want to
dice up some onions some ginger and some
spring onions and of course being
filipino you need hella garlic houston
we have a problem i broke the garlic
crusher i used these mussels you know
and get your pot and add those
ingredients in and saute them for a
little bit and get your chicken in there
let the chicken get a good sear then you
want to add your glutinous rice and get
some water and let that come to a boil
and leave that to boil for about an hour
the chicken should be nice and soft so
you take out the chicken shred it and
then you can add it back to the bowl
while that's boiling away you get a new
pot and you fry the rest of the garlic
once that's nice and golden brown get a
bowl and you can serve it up and
sprinkle some of that fried garlic on
the top add you know half a bottle of
egg to it that would do
just want to say the eggs need some work
i know i know it's not you adolescent
okay okay thanks that is ready to go
okay we're here i have been the most
excited for this dish i think because
it's the most different to anything sort
of having persian cooking cheers
everyone
hmm
[Music]
wow wow wow wow that is like
flavor overload it's so good what i
already love is the crunchy garlic fits
on top it just like elevates it so much
do you know what i can imagine this is
like amazing for if you're not feeling
too well or if you just want a really
hearty meal like when the rain is
falling outside and the wind is kind of
breezy
i just took like bites of the ginger now
that that
that
makes the dish do you know what i really
love about ariel's cow dog it really
feels nostalgic it just feels like a big
warm hug thank you godfrey for putting
this on the menu like 10 out of 10 for
everything so far and i'm pretty sure
dinner is gonna be insane
iranian food is known for being very
aromatic and this is a grand example
it's basically a persian herd frittata
and it's really good for vegetarians
i've never used so many herbs in my life
look how much cut your onion and relief
very finely some people like to use
lettuce in their cooker sabzi but you
know each their own my favorite part
time to chop up all the herbs
and just so you know the kitchen is
gonna smell so amazing smells so good
this will definitely be probably the
healthiest thing i've eaten in a long
time cook the onions and the leeks just
so they soften up nicely then add your
eggs to your herb mixture and then it's
time to add salt pepper turmeric
fenugreek leaves and a bit of baking
powder if you want then fold the leek
and onion in and give it a good mix i
can't wait for it to be cooked now
because if it tastes anything like it
smells oh i'm excited then it's time to
work like a frying pan put your mixture
in and let that fry for about six to
seven minutes do me proud
i'll be back if it's still a little bit
jiggly on the top probably to pop in the
oven for a minute or two just to set it
and now it's time to flip sepi how am i
supposed to flip it
the pancake way oh no it can't be that
way
oh
look at that
back on the pot and crisp up and then
you're done and you've successfully made
kuru sabzi nu
and this is my cuckoo subsidy
look at that excited for this let me cut
it and see what the inside looks like
let's have a look
oh look at that nushing
it's got everything you needed it's got
like the herbs the onions and it's got
the egg so it's kind of like an omelette
kind of texture you just feel good when
you eat it and it tastes delicious thank
you this is so good by itself is really
nice i don't feel like you need anything
with it it's amazing you know especially
if you're like trying to eat more veg
they're still here forward i definitely
made this again for sure
beef caldereta is as beef stew with
vegetables you really can't get this
dish wrong so to start you want to saute
your onions your garlic and tomatoes
till they're nice and brown then you add
your beef to the pot and let that cook
for a bit and let it brown before you
start covering it up so far it smells so
good just like all the other dishes i've
made and i can't wait to let this like
sit and rest for a bit and i feel like
it's gonna become so juicy and flavorful
and i just know it's gonna taste so good
after a while we'll add the tomato puree
the liver pattern give that a good mix
you want to add the rest of your
vegetables your potatoes your carrots
your peppers you want to let it cook and
boil until the veg is nice and soft and
ready to eat but yeah you can literally
have it by itself or with rice or
whatever carb you want but beef calories
are you can't go wrong it's really cold
as well at the moment so i feel like
this is the perfect dish to enjoy right
now so cheers bon appetit
oh my gosh
[Applause]
i really like the beef stew for a long
long time and it's made it so melty in
your mouth also i had the idea of
bringing one of the panda style rolls i
made earlier because i just thought it'd
be a good idea to dip in the stew
hopefully i'm not doing a disservice or
anything
oh
oh my gosh
as we always do in our household we
always have rice left over from like the
day before or two i'm gonna try a bit
with the rice as well
i feel so happy
i can tell these dishes are like a labor
of love and i think that's one thing i
can say about persian food too and i can
see that in common with all the dishes
i've been making
i genuinely don't know what else to say
it's just blowing my mind
this is absolutely delightful
i thought i'd give this dish to godfrey
because it's a bit more of an
introduction in how to make persian rice
a lot of the time when we make rice
dishes we make teddy which is an
absolute must
it's time for dinner it's time for me to
put my crocs into sports mode this one's
going to be a tough one
first of all most importantly i cannot
emphasize this enough wash your rice
make sure you do this until the water's
clear it's about five washes in time to
let it soak now chop up your green beans
into small pieces and get rid of the
ends and then boil them finely chop up
one onion and then add your lamb
now it's time to boil your rice boil it
until it's al dente
you know then add your salt pepper
turmeric cinnamon tomato paste and mix
add your cooked green beans and then put
that to the side
and now it's teddy time put your pan on
medium to high heat add a little oil or
butter add a bit of saffron to the base
and swivel the pot so it
mixes around
let all
pack the base of your pot tight with
rice make some holes in the rice and add
a little bit of butter add your lamb and
green bean mixture to the top put enough
to cover the first layer of rice and
then add another layer of rice on top
and mix oh look at the color i can't
give it to you guys
then cover the rice and leave for 30
minutes or more i hope and i pray i'll
take it right
check the rice if the grains are fluffy
and cooked that means one thing it's
time for the taddy flip
okay i've never done this before
[Music]
place a big plate over the top of your
pot put one hand on each side and
confidently flip i don't have a plate
big enough for it this is the biggest
plate i've got
okay
ah
oh look at that
i did it you did it and now it is time
for you to enjoy your lubiopolo with
your tattoo and your side of yogurt
enjoy time to taste it okay it's dinner
time and time for something
oh
wow oh it is crunchy yes
look at this it still remain crispy on
the top which i'm actually surprised so
this is my first time having teddy ever
new sheijan
[Music]
whoa
where has this been my whole life i used
to avoid like the really crispy bits of
rice but like this this is banging
apparently i'm supposed to enjoy this
with a bit of yogurt
whoa
what
this works so well if you haven't tried
this before and you love rice you gotta
have this it's got me my favorite thing
today
i love this i love it
[Music]
so godfrey how did you find it wow
cooking iranian food was fun it was my
first time ever baking so making bread
like that was tricky it got stuck to my
hands a lot yeah i saw okay how how how
and how did you find cooking filipino
food oh i loved it honestly i'm still
kind of like why have i never made
filipino food before i know i'm gonna
make it those times more because i loved
it so much so godfrey what was your
favorite to eat and cook i think my
favorite thing to cook and eat was the
cuckoo sabzi because it was like
literally a fresh bunch of ingredients
that i've never cooked with before it
opened my eyes to some new flavors and a
new way of cooking going into this i was
actually the most excited to make the
almost cow caldo because i think it was
the most different to anything i really
make i am absolutely obsessed with
ginger something i've like learned
throughout this whole process i mean i'm
glad you enjoyed the filipino food i
definitely enjoyed iranian food
