Good morning or good afternoon wherever you are so welcome to another episode 
here in the Philippines and today it's a very fun  
episode because we're trying another fast food 
chain here in the Philippines so we're currently  
here in Cebu City Hall let me show you around so 
we're going on to the third floor and apparently  
that's where chow King is but anyway as you can 
see this shopping mall is very modern and to my  
knowledge Chowking as you guys recommended it it's a 
mix of Chinese and Filipino Cuisines so let's head  
over there now because I'm super hungry all right 
so continuing our walk here we found Toys R Us  
which is something I haven't seen for a very long 
time not in Hong Kong or in Australia because even  
in Hong Kong I think they close down quite a few 
anyway we are next to McDonald's something that  
I've been meaning to try here in the Philippines 
as well because go into every country I think  
trying McDonald's is a must you guys need to know 
how different it is compare to other countries all  
right look um McDonald's shakies what's shakies 
over there far away yeah that guy's talking  
so loud he's so excited but we've got Dunkin 
Donuts here one of my favorite Auntie Anne's
I know Auntie is it Tita I think that's what 
you guys taught me Tita many Filipinos viewers  
taught me Tita it's Auntie I believe and we've 
got Harbor City here and this uh feels like a  
Hong Kong place because Harbor City Hong 
Kong is a harbor so I think this is Hong  
Kong and we've got KFC over here something 
I want to try as well many all the fast food  
options I want to try here KFC KFC where is 
chow King ah there alright Chowking is there
see there are many many competitions over here 
in the shopping mall there are a variety of  
options but also you put the fast food stores 
all together so super high competition Jollibee  
on this side and then KFC on this side and then 
next to it there's chowKing but anyway let's try  
Chowking today because that's what we came for 
we're ready to eat some Chinese Filipino food
so we're here ChowKing alright let's check 
it out let's have a look at the menu first  
so first impression of the menu there is 
a lot of Chinese dishes so here you got  
dim sum the classic Asado xiaobao I want to 
try that Asado I want to try at least what  
it is like even though it's not the proper 
Asado but I want to try at least the bun  
and it's got dim Sim here as well and you got 
spring rolls many Chinese dishes I think very  
Chinese looks and you've got stir fries with 
wonton noodles what else we've got beef wonton  
mami I think that means noodles fancy canton lumpiang shanghai stir some sort of stir  
fry with spring rolls and they've got Fried 
Chicken here like mini Fried Chicken. wow loud annoucement 
and pork chow fan chow fan I think that's 
like fried rice according to my cantonese
They have halo halo? we will try the halo halo here at chowking then
It is one of the favorites that our viewers told us and you've got 
fried chicken with fries over there so Fried  
Chicken's menu and I want to try chow fan because I think this is one of the signature  
dishes here maybe number 34. alight guys so on 
this side we've got a halo halo that we didnt get to try last time  
what's that place called again? mang inasal but we didn't try it there anyways we got halo halo here. wow the announcement is so loud  
and everyone can hear it but uh what else do 
we got here we've got some takeaway playlist  
I'm assuming it's bigger plates shared by families 
um I don't know I'm still deciding still deciding  
many options here um but I definitely want 
to get the fried rice today and alina wants  
to get the wonton Noodles I think today yep 
so no just one tense too no one's in noodles
lots of decision making I'm not very good at 
decisions hello how are you hi hey here please  
so can I grab the um wonton mami no no mami just 
wonton soup and then I'll get the xiaomai yeah  
four pieces yes okay four pieces please beef or
chicken oh chicken steamed or fried many options  
yeah steam Steam and then and uh I think that's it 
and for me I'll get the beef xiomai beef chow fan 
thank you that's the best the best 
year so the best seller sir is pork
Okay pork chow fan then I will try the. Pork chow fan with coffee or drinks?
Pork chow fan beef? Is it pork chow fan?
um I will get the beef then. Steamed or fried? Steam, healthier
And then your drinks? Ice tea cola spite. Ice tea please
what else I think that's it for today oh I'm 
sorry halo halo we'll get a I'm sorry sir
We dont have halo halo. No, we dont have ice cream yet oh know. Again, yeah this area no ice cream that's okay
I repeat your order

You are doing a great job alright
so many options here. I wasn't expecting that uh 220. [Music]
here you go thank you
Your table number is 95, we will call you that later sir okay
again no Halo halo, but anyway i hope next time maybe if we order delivery they might have halo halo here
next time hopefully at another chowking or maybe out of this area we can find halo halo. I think this area is having ice cream shortage at the moment
where do we sit guys?
oh you can sit outside yes let's sit 
outside because I think outside is  
more quiet so I can talk to you 
guys as well and yeah I just feel  
like the reason I didn't order Fried 
Chicken here was because I feel like  
fast food like if I get fried chicken I wouldn't 
come in chowKing I would come to like KFC or go  
to Jollibee like but here I think the special 
is the fried rice and noodles and especially  
when I asked the waitress just then the cashier and she 
said the special here it's Rice and Noodles  
so of course you're gonna try that alright our 
order is ready 95 and let's see I don't know how  
big the portion will be but I expect here in the 
Philippines always portion is quite big let's see
that's ours
alright
so I forgot to look at the other the rest 
of it oh this is ours wow thank you so much
gojek gojek Delivery Express Delivery to Alina no 
food Panda I mean gojek is Indonesian  
well Alina looks so beautiful 
when she ties up her hair thank you

Alina ties up her hair I think

thought there are you orderfour no?

the xiomai there are four for okay the only two  
I think wonton anyway it looks quite 
delicious I'm excited to try everything  
okay I try yes. How this is called? this is siomai siomai 
and cantonese it is is siu mai siu mai yeah
it's one of Hong Kong's I guess like yeah 
one of Hong Kong signature dish I think
you know Alina likes it with her face like  
is it really I love it wow really Chowking is 
your favorite fast food now sorry mang inasal
I believe it's still my favorite but it is still too early to decide
let's try this one 
Okay I will try mine then. Mine is pork. Is yours?
okay
okay
whoa whoa you're so spicy so spicy how 
can you eat it normally you cannot eat it  
but yeah you're right very good I think so nice
it was very delicious how is rice oh I 
like it veggie yes every meal we have  
to get some veggies healthy reasons you 
know teamwork you wanna try it everyone  
but you only have two it's okay you eat it's 
okay you need three no you eat okay sat down
I like it you guys don't know already a bit 
of History Alina actually went to China how  
long did you live that bowl around one year one 
year wow yeah across different different states  
different places yeah wow yeah so Alina is very 
familiar with all the flavors of Chinese food
goodies
Super Mario blue do you want to try 
my rice baby I think the rice it's a  
little bit different from normal fried rice 
I don't know what that kind of like oil what  
special oil I don't know but it's um it smells 
nice that's the thing fried rice that smells nice  
I have something in Russian kitchen it's called 
pull off it's like so similar taste love love  
like outside rice inside many fragments the fried 
rice dish as well uh yeah oh wait no it's still  
rice okay this might sound like a huge 
compliment but this actually reminds me of  
ding type thing type oh yeah you know then typhoon 
the Chinese restaurant the most famous Chinese  
restaurants around the world this kind of reminds 
me of the truffle fried rice that they have there  
because yeah it's just that oil on top of the 
fried rice got it and mix this with my rice  
thank you guys I can spice you crazy better 
than me maybe even yeah I don't know I feel I  
feel a bit spicy this one it's so tasty I like the 
sauce what is this I think it's a it's a popcorn
sesame oil sesame oil I don't think so I 
think this is um isn't this just chili oil  
I know it's something in Cantonese it's 
called taosi I don't know if this is it  
um it's like spicy just remind me 
to China food wow three dumplings  
yes xiomai I'm glad you like it because they're 
administrates your mind in Hong Kong and they  
they set up like chili sauce they mix it with soy 
sauce so it's usually it's more fresh it's prawns  
as well usually sometimes they add mushroom 
inside oh Chowking what's the Chinese name oh  
two hundred that means so what does Chowking mean 
is it just the name of the person who founded this  
shop why they say they don't have no ice cream 
I think Philippines is under ice cream shortage  
not enough ice cream in this country
uh yeah so strange because last time we went to 
marinaso no ice cream this sandwich everywhere
to keep some ice cream for us 
guys don't eat all our ice cream  
for me maybe because I grew up in like Hong 
Kong Chinese food to me is like something that  
I always have so to me it's nothing to like 
special for me it's yeah just like you know  
fried rice it tastes delicious so don't get me 
wrong but for me it just tastes the same because  
I grew up eating dim sum every week weekend 
every Sunday I go to get them some of my family
every week I eat the same you guys 
understand where I'm coming from but uh  
it's a good place for you to experience 
Chinese culture definitely for sure and  
quite affordable prices as well I think 
quite delicious I think it's so much it's  
yeah it's quite delicious the texture is 
nicer compared to this one I think it's  
um this is pop show my and I think the 
one Elena had was better I think thank you
eggs
my order
second one
okay okay I give you a two give me two yeah 
so nice of you today okay oh that's not  
again I think when I laugh I always talk 
like this cute this is Alina's favorite  
your mind and she loves spicy sauce 
see this time we are eating the sauce
okay my turn I got some chili sauce 
this time we use the sauce nice
the chicken so much so much better it's really 
amazing chicken I think if you come Chowking  
personally for us we'll recommend chicken wings 
pork is okay for me it's spicy I can imagine you  
it's very spicy I think this and it's like help 
me tells me eat one more it's helped me cool down  
cool down your tongue pull down my fire go 
down your fire yes extinguish your fire exactly  
eat my baby you no eat one 
more you like this dish we
would
I give you a Justin drink
okay okay
I'm spicy my tongue is five yes I know you're so 
spicy thank you okay it does feel better after  
drinking this I think iced tea with spicy 
sauce dumplings it's a good match okay give  
me a rating 10 out of ten how how many ten the 
dumplings ten chicken dumplings I mean siomai this  
yes nine wow okay sauce sauce twenty twenty wow 
I'm very very shocked that Alina likes spicy  
sauce because before like if you asked me three 
or four months ago Alina has spicy sauce she can't  
take it and she will cry and have stomach issues 
but wow you've improved so much so good so good
fried rice
I agree I sampling oh dumb things to three 
I somewhat agree actually chicken dumplings  
it's a lot better than a popcorn I think my 
popcorn it feels it feels okay for me the fried  
rice is okay for me as well I think we need a 
dessert maybe I think we need dessert I think  
um yeah I think you know what's missing today 
you know today today is a good day so today  
let's celebrate with Krispy Kreme I think today 
today it's a very good day to have Krispy Kreme  
you know why because Krispy Kreme starts with 
2K KK you know and cream cream makes you you're  
so addictive you crispy Kreme I don't think so 
I think Crispy Cream is just crispy and cream  
you know so it's a very delicious I I promise 
you I don't talk about Krispy cream every day  
but I do think crispy creamy it's a it's a it's a 
daily necessity every day you need to have one one  
day one Krispy cream a day keeps a doctor away
