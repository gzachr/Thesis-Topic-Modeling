so i just try to talk to a couple sisters 
to the catholic church a couple of nuns  
and uh they were here taking pictures and i 
guess there are missionaries passing through  
even the the nuns are coming to this mall 
so i told you i said it i warned you i'm  
gonna do a lot of malls here when i'm in the 
philippines venice grand canal mall so this one  
honestly i've never been to this one i've 
seen a million pictures this is super  
photographical and this is gonna be my first time 
here and i'm excited to see it so let's go check  
it out so here it is finally after seeing all 
those photos i mean i've probably seen 100 photos  
it seems like you see it all the time i finally 
made it third time in the philippines i made it  
to the canal and i can't keep talking because the 
music's too loud but here we go i'm in italy baby  
finish small i could really use a change of 
scenery everybody's smoking all the greenery  
close the match cause they were handed down 
to me but i'm still fly i'm still fly i know
it's thanos dinos is in the philippines i should 
have known it filipinos are all around the world  
of course there's a filipino thanos so this 
place is really really cool so far but i have  
to say it's hard to film because they got 
the music blasting everywhere they got the  
copyright music we got neil young playing right 
now that's hard like i'm trying to hide from  
the music but this is cool this is honestly one 
of the cooler malls i've ever been to actually  
i just noticed it opens up over here too  
it's funny too because when i first walked into 
the mall i was like man this isn't very grandiose  
but this is why this is the this is the whole 
appeal of it right here i mean you're in italy  
in the philippines i bet you this place looks 
crazy at night i'd like to see it at night let's  
worse i could go a hater like you oh oh 
there's the jester are you a jester yeah
can you say anything or no oh no are you is 
that a gesture though i don't know i hope  
the music's too loud filipino jesters too 
i gotta give them some some filipino pistol  
oh you got the bills in there you have to keep 
all the cash you have to split it with the mall
oh man lucky i only got 100. all right 
justin thank you thank you thank you
man that dude was making some money 
he had a lot of money in there  
of course too listen just so you know 
they got america's favorite diner here  
in the philippines they got a lot of dinner well 
not a lot but i've seen quite a few denny's here
from
so this mall is two stories there's two levels 
and i'm having a hard time filming because there  
they got the music covered here they're blasting 
on speakers all around but i'm gonna do a little  
clip show you the favorites of course they got the 
mcdonald's the jollibee and all the classics that  
you would need in a mall this is honestly 
one of the coolest malls i've ever been to  
it's not like the craziest mall but as far as 
like the setup of it i mean it's like you're  
in venice i mean i think that's pretty cool 
i haven't seen a cooler mall i've been to  
some cool locations i've seen some pretty crazy 
locations like the mall in bali was really cool  
there's some malls on the beaches but as far 
as like the the originality the design of it  
i think this mall i think this is i think this is 
my number one mall right now bold statement it's  
full statement so there's a part of the mall over 
here called mega world cinemas and i'm gonna go  
see if this is just the movie theater i can feel 
the air con so i'm gonna go cool off a little bit  
okay well here's the movie theater it's right here
you can see a cinema up here too which is awesome 
i always gotta have the movie theater in the mall  
batman of course so there's the super famous 
picture spot from the second story point of view  
this mall isn't very big but it's cool and 
there's a lot going on visually stimulating on  
the other side i didn't know this but there's an 
indoor part of the mall it's just like a regular  
traditional indoor part of the mall it's got a 
few floors too it's pretty sweet so they got a  
k-pop thing going on here i don't know if it's 
like a convention but i guess tomorrow they got  
a class where you can learn k-pop and i know 
the k-pop super super popular in asia right now
so this is interesting because on this 
side of the mall they got the shops and i  
wasn't expecting this at all i just was 
what i saw earlier it's kind of cool
there's a whole other little courtyard 
area out here that i just came across  
some food courts or something that they set up 
at night that they do on the weekend they kind  
of do like a little farmer's market type deal with 
foods and stuff like that i don't know what it is  
but for whatever reason i'm a sucker for indoor 
plants and they got this cool little plant area  
that's got these it's got plants and that 
tree is real it's a real tree i don't  
know if i've seen that and what's crazy 
about it is it's planted in the ground
i've never seen that it's usually in pots 
they're usually in like big pots like this  
that's pretty sweet so there it is the venice 
grand canal mall in manila philippines and i  
will say this i said it earlier and i'll say it 
again by design this is the coolest mall i've ever  
been to it's not like the most shops or anything 
like that but as far as like the creativity of it  
i mean i haven't been to a cooler mall personally 
so anyways if you're ever in manila you should  
definitely check this place out it's really cool 
they got restaurants plenty of shops and tons  
of places to take photographs it's ridiculous it 
seems it's basically like a photo studio i don't  
even know if this is really a mall but anyways 
thank you for watching and we'll see you next time
you
