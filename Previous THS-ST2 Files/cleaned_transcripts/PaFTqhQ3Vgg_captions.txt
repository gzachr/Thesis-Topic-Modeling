yo this is Chef Ricky your true pinoy chef
and today I will make a reaction video
on the reaction video of uncle roger regarding the way of cooking fried rice
or the egg fried rice of miss hersha patel
Now let's see what the reaction is all about
is the reaction right regarding the way the egg fried rice was cooked
by miss hersha patel of bbc
Alright, so  that's right before you cook the rice make sure to wash it
Like Japanese rice they have to wash it 10 times until the water is clear before using it for sushi
okay let's go back
so he was surprised about draining the rice
it is not normal to do it in this kind of rice
but for a different types of rice it is being done
looking at miss hersha patel, I think she grew up in an Indian household
they cook basmati rice
and when you are cooking basmati rice you need to drain it
that is the way to cook it
you need a colander to drain the water
cooked it for at least 90%
then rest of the ten percent
you can finish it in your biryani dish
you can use it on chicken or beef biryani
that is how to cook it
this is pretty normal
now check this video it has like 18 million views and you can see how normal it is for them to drain rice
all right so maybe uncle roger doesn't know anything about it
this is asian stuff okay
this is asian way of cooking rice also
the only mistake of miss hersha patel here
is that she's draining the rice
but it's not basmati rice all right
let's watch again
So we notice that the rice is being wash
I think she wanted it to get cold right away
is still the same technique use in basmati rice
She probably learn from her parents
so this is normal really really normal
in an indian household they really do this
now this is much better
You will use this for fried rice
you cannot use hot rice for fried rice
so since she is on a hurry she improvised
It's a common thing that we do in the kitchen
i may also do this if I will be ask to make a fries rice
If there is no cold rice in ready I will also do this to improvise
i will drain it and wash is with cold water before making fried rice
so it will be cook right so this is normal
its just that uncle roger's reaction a little bit exagerated
probably he has a little idea how to work in the kitchen
all right let's watch more
Alright MSG is Vetsin
A lot of people saying that MSG is bad to your health
But also a lot of people saying it has no bad effect
But do not drink beer then put MSG on it
I dont think its a good idea
it's an urban legend and better to stay away from it
Filipinos like use magic sarap instead
okay so the the reaction is about
the spoon she's using it on a non-stick
pan this one is metal and
that's a no no in the kitchen
its a no no to use any metal things
in a non stick pan
your ladel should be made of wood
it may destroy the pan
and that's a real no-no in a kitchen
all right so thats a right reaction
all right so we're done watching
for me the reaction about washing rice is a littel exagerated
he's probably not a cook to know about this things
some other chef will actually do that
since this is a cooking show all procedure must be correct
nigel ng i think that's his real name
or uncle roger
if you havent seen this video
i will put the link below on the
description

so again this is chef ricky your
true pinoy chef
bye for now see ya
