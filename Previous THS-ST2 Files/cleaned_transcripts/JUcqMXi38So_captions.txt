Hi!
Finally
I've now arrived in the Philippines
It's still empty here. There's no one. there's only me.   
I'm so happy! I'm in the Phillippines now!
I'm sorry
My battery is low so I had to change it  
I'll show you around 
Hi!
Hi!
What's your name?
I'm Gerald
Hi, Gerald!
Are you Filipino?
Yes
Can you teach me uh some..
Filipino language?
Yeah, like how to say good morning
Magandang umaga (good morning)
Ah, magandang umaga
Is it right?
*nodded*
Okay, thank youuu
Okay. I want to tell you the story about yesterday  
You know, I had a flight to the Philippines
I have a long flight and you 
know.. 
I didn't expect it would be that long
But
I don't need to
worry anymore because I'm here now
I'll show you how long the flight was
Look
On the first flight, I started from Saumlaki to Ambon
And the next flight.. I need to change the 
airline. I had to wait for 25 minutes and then I flew from
Ambon to Makassar. I need to layover at 
Makassar. After that, I flew to Surabaya  
Oh this is so so long  
I mean it wasn't that long but still felt like..
Because this is my first flight (abroad)
and the next is Singapore 
So, from Surabaya to Singapore 
Then from Singapore to Manila
I'm still here because I 
need to wait for my boyfriend
We agreed to meet here
At first, when I got ready to go to the Philippines
I have a friend in Saumlaki who took me to the airport
It was like 2 hours away
to get to the airport  
No, it wasn't 2 hours. Maybe less? I don't remember
It was like something around that hours
and then.. 
wait I need to check it on my phone
Because I forget about that
But I'll show you
Oh this
Okay and then I need to wait for like.. 40 
minutes and then go to ambon  
This is my first time going out from Indonesia (going abroad)  
But I feel like..
I don't know
I'm just like..
I don't feel alone
Because I met lots of new friends
when I was on the airplane
I talked with so many people
Maybe like 5?
And when I was in Singapore, I met some Indonesian too
they're nice 
they want to go to Hongkong
I hope they'll watch
this video
I was surprised when I arrived in the Philippines 
 
The people are so kind
They're so nice and smiley
and yeah I'm feeling like I'm at home ^_^
Even though I'm in the Philippines
You can see it here
It's still empty
There's only me
I've been here for 2 hours
I think so
This is the situation
I need to go out there but my battery is..
I don't have a charger to charge my batteries
I don't want to be separated from my boyfriend
I think this is easy for me to find him
because that's the immigration there
So, I can see him when he arrives 
and finish to pass the immigration
Okay, I'll show you how it looks like here  
It's like the baggage claim area
I love the Philippines airport
It's like.. 
Ah, when I arrived in Singapore, I wanted to go around there but,
I only have like 4 hours  
and (the place is very big) everywhere is so far away
So, I don't think I have the time to go around the airport
I have a little conversation with nice 
people here, like the staff 
 they're saying hello 
And you know, when I was on the airplane there are some people who talked to me in Thai
I was like. "No, I'm Indonesian."  
and then when I went to claim my luggage
They thought I'm a Filipino but I'm not a Filipino
I like meeting people here
So, my first impression of the Philippines is amazing  
I'm amazed about this first time going out from Indonesia and traveling alone  
(far) from the island where I live and right now I'm here
 I feel so happy. I'm so grateful
This is my luggage
 I only brought this much because I don't want to..
This is my first time (going abroad) so I don't want to bring many things
Like too heavy
Like a suitcase or a kind of that
This is easy 
Inside I have
some clothes and my essential things 
and then my drone
I put my drone here 
I hope everything is fine. I don't want to 
carry a lot (of things) and guess what..  
I also brought my mom's chips because my boyfriend wants to try it 
and my mom wants him to try as well
In Indonesia, this is like uh.. chips..
This is keripik pisang (banana chips)
and 
Kacang bawang (peanut garlic)
and this one I think..
I don't know what it is but it's
made of peanut too and my mom put something sweet yeah something like that
and all of these are my mom's products
My mom has a business in Saumlaki
 She makes chips and sells them
Selling chips, selling everything from 
my dad's garden and just yeah like that  
My mom wants my boyfriend to try (the chips) I hope he likes it 
Because it's Indonesian taste but I know he'll likes it
I know his taste
I hope he'll like that
What's next? 
Earlier this morning, 
I saw some staff just arranged all of these things
everything here like this 
so when people 
come, that's easy (for them) to put their baggage here
Hello!!
Hello! Good morning!
Good morning! What is good morning 
in Filipino? I forgot 
Magandang umaga
Ah yeah, magandang umaga
is it right?
Yeah
Magandang umaga :D
Beautiful is maganda
Maganda?
Beautiful
Pardon? Me?
Yes
Thank you
that's one of the best impression about 
Philippines
and it's only me here
Look! so spacious!
I'm so sad because maybe the type 
of my charger isn't compatible with-
I forgot to bring it though
When you travel in another country maybe you have a different type of this one..
So, I cannot put my charger
There's no power
Oh, there's no power? ah this isn't working
that makes sense
I thought my charger is broken
it still can't be use?
Yes
Oh, okay..
If you want.. there
Ah, yeah. It's okay
Over there
Ah, this?
Can I use it? like..
Of course
We have a same..
Okay, I can try it.   
Okay, thank you, Ma'am.
Okay, I can try
I want to charge my Iphone
 Hold on, I need to..
Let's charge my battery first
They're nice though
They helped me
I love them
Hello! Magandang umaga ^_^
Is it right?
Yes
okay
Okay, I'm charging here  
You can't put this here. It's okay
Ah, okay. It's okay to put it here?
Yes
Thank you, Ma'am. 
Okay, I can keep an eye on it from here
My problem is solved now
I thought my charger or my USB is broken, but the lady explained that this one isn't 
Uh.. it doesn't have power (not working)
so I can't use this  
but it's okay
I already charge my other phone with my power bank
My power bank still has some energy
Magandang umaga
I've learned one thing
Maybe the next.. What's next?
I want to learn the Filipino language
I love that
I think this is my first episode in the Philippines
