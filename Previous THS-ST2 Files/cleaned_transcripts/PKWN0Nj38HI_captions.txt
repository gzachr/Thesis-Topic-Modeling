hey guys we're lloyd and mandy we're 
digital nomads that have been traveling  
through southeast asia for the past nine 
months and today we're going to be sharing  
with you our top seven things we wish we knew 
before traveling to the philippines in 2022
so we've been in the philippines 
now for almost a month  
and to be honest we didn't do a lot of 
research before coming here we just knew  
it was somewhere we really wanted to go 
so hopefully this information will help  
you guys have a better understanding 
of what it's like here before you come
so number seven would be the wi-fi for us as 
digital nomads it's extremely important for  
us to have high-speed internet and reliable 
wi-fi because our jobs depend on it and the  
wi-fi is a little bit spotty and a little bit 
unreliable since we've been in the philippines  
it's something that we think everyone needs to 
be aware of maybe before coming here if you are  
someone like us as a nomad if you are just coming 
on holiday it's probably the best place to unplug  
because you don't really have to worry about that 
but as far as the wi-fi speed downloading seems to  
be okay but the upload speed is quite slow uh for 
us as youtubers and just for our other businesses  
as well it's been a bit of a struggle we do use 
a video compressor i myself use handbrake for all  
of our youtube videos something to keep in mind 
it's a free app that you can download for your  
computer just to compress your videos to make the 
file smaller so that's sort of a little tip that  
i'll give to you if you are planning on coming 
here as a youtuber makes your videos smaller  
and the upload speed pretty much cuts in half by 
using that yeah so like mandy said it's not even  
really that the wi-fi is slow it's more that it's 
unreliable you can still stream movies and things  
like that but it's the upload speed that really 
gets you and we find that whenever we check into  
a hotel the wi-fi is fine for the first day and 
i think it sort of runs out of data or something  
because by day two or three it's really bad it's 
really spotty and we find ourselves having to  
upload things overnight we actually have a little 
hack for the slow wi-fi which is purchasing a sim  
card to bring around with you it's really cheap 
and it's just like an extra backup in case the  
wi-fi doesn't work there's really two companies 
you can buy a sim card with and it's either smart  
or globe we went with smart because it had better 
reviews and we just went into a store and bought  
a new sim card it was really easy actually the 
security guard is the one who sold it to us yeah  
and there's places you can reload 
that everywhere but like i said  
we haven't really had to use it 
we just had it as an emergency  
if you're on the little islands or provinces 
you can reload it pretty much from anywhere
so number six and this is something we weren't 
really expecting was accommodation seems to be  
more expensive than other places in southeast 
asia mainly thailand vietnam and bali we're  
expecting the accommodation to be quite 
similar but it's not you really don't get  
as much value for money you have to spend a 
little bit extra so to give you an example in  
vietnam and thailand we're spending like 25 to 30 
australian dollars a night and we're getting like  
really good wi-fi sometimes breakfast a gym things 
like that really like good hotels four-star hotels  
maybe it had something to do with the pandemic but 
in the philippines we've really struggled to find  
anything on the same level for under 60 australian 
dollars yeah nothing's really ticked all the boxes  
for us so far um i guess one of them being the 
wi-fi if we find somewhere that's beautiful and  
looks good usually the wi-fi hasn't been good so 
yeah that has been a bit of a challenge as well  
since we've been here that's not to say that the 
philippines is more expensive we actually just did  
a video on the cost of living in the philippines 
you can click the link and watch it later  
but it sort of evens out because other things 
like food and transport is really cheap here
so number five is probably my favorite one 
philippines says the best seafood i've ever  
had in my life and the best barbecue 
as well i've said this in multiple  
of our videos so everyone's probably sick of me 
saying it but it's true delicious and so fresh  
yeah and honestly it makes sense because the 
philippines is thousands of islands and you're  
surrounded by water everywhere you go so it does 
make sense that they would have good seafood but  
the barbecue is something that really took 
us by surprise the barbecue's been awesome
so number four traveling around the philippines 
isn't really cheap now when i say transport's  
cheap that means like taxis and grabs and 
motorbike hire that's all cheap but because  
everything's sort of so isolated um if you want to 
travel from different provinces to other islands  
it's not that cheap because you have to either get 
a flight or you have to get a ferry which actually  
isn't that cheap either you're going to probably 
spend about 100 to 200 australian um getting from  
one island to another so if you want to go island 
hopping in the philippines just be prepared to  
plan ahead if you can because you will get cheaper 
flights but we sort of plan a lot of our stuff  
last minute so it wasn't very cheap for us 
at all yeah i think our way of traveling  
maybe is a bit different to most like if you're 
coming for a holiday obviously it's going to be  
a little bit different than if you are just like 
a nomad like us working on the road and planning  
a few days in advance but yeah definitely if you 
can plan in advance do so yeah if i hadn't known  
how expensive it would have been we probably would 
have booked a lot of our trip a bit earlier yeah
we're actually quite surprised at how many people 
speak english here um if you go to some of the  
smaller islands it's still a little bit of a grey 
area where they don't speak as good at english  
but pretty much everywhere if you walk into 
a shop or a restaurant and you speak english  
they're going to know what you're saying to 
an extent anyway because i have an australian  
accent and they don't understand it anymore and 
no one understands you but that actually brings  
us to today's video sponsor busu sabusu is a 
language learning platform that connects over 120  
million users all over the world busu provides 
compact lessons from experts and connects with  
a community of native speakers to help learners 
master new languages faster they break down  
learning into small achievable lessons that 
make learning easier and more motivating we've  
actually noticed since traveling through asia 
how limited we are with only knowing one language  
yeah it actually feels a little bit selfish going 
everywhere and expecting them all just to speak  
english so we've made it a goal of ours this 
year to learn one new language using busu and  
the beauty of it is when you sign up you'll get a 
personalized study plan and get friendly reminders  
when it's time to learn using busu's expertly 
designed lessons they also use smart technology  
in the review section which highlights what to 
revise and when we've actually just started using  
busu and we decided we're going to start taking 
spanish lessons the self-paced learning really  
works because you get to be in control with busu 
you can actually talk to real native speakers and  
practice what you've learned immediately through 
their theory to practice if you're interested in  
learning a new language this year like we are you 
can click the link below and start learning for  
free by trying out the busu premium free trial 
for seven days all right now back to the video
so one thing i noticed and wasn't really 
expecting is just how much of an american  
influence there is here i didn't know but 
apparently philippines is the only country in  
asia that doesn't use chopsticks as we mentioned 
before their bbq is amazing and you'll find like  
burger joints and really like western americanized 
food restaurants all over the philippines  
they also drive on the right hand side of the 
road which was a bit of a shock coming from  
the other parts of south east asia they also as 
we mentioned they speak a lot of english and the  
number one sport in the philippines is basketball 
which was very surprising because everywhere else  
in asia it seems to be like soccer or football 
whatever you call it lots of soccer yeah  
we're actually going to our first filipino 
basketball game in a couple days so make sure  
you check out that video when we release it as 
a canadian i feel like i felt more at home here  
because of the american influence i don't know 
i've because of all the other countries we've been  
to it was kind of nice coming somewhere that had 
that american feel to it it sort of made me feel  
yeah like i was back in canada a little 
bit i'd say it's not quite as much of  
a culture shock as it is going to like 
indonesia and vietnam and thailand yeah
and number one would be the weather so 
the weather's been pretty inconsistent  
and different everywhere that we've been so 
far yeah i was really surprised because the  
first place we really went was el nido and it 
pretty much rained every day which we knew were  
coming in the middle of wet season but then 
somebody reached out to us and told us that  
chagao is actually dry season and i thought 
that can't be possible like they're not that  
far from each other i think it's about an hour 
flight or something and it turns out that july  
is the driest month in shigao and since we've been 
here it's been pretty much blue skies every day  
it's been beautiful the best weather and the water 
and everything like just being in chicago has been  
beautiful like the best i think actually the best 
weather we've had since we've been in southeast  
asia for sure yeah for sure i mean it does rain a 
lot in chigao but we just happen to get lucky and  
be here in the dry months so if you're planning a 
trip to the philippines it's not a blanket weather  
system across the whole country just do your 
research and you'll find you'll find that there's  
probably certain areas that you're better off 
going at certain times a year just keep in mind if  
you are going to these other islands as well just 
an extra side note because of the rainy season and  
being on islands it is a little bit buggy i've 
noticed like there's lots of you know creepy  
crawlies and mosquitoes are pretty prevalent here 
so if you are you know prone to getting bit just  
keep that in mind bring lots of mosquito repellent 
with you because i'm someone that get constantly  
gets bit by everything so just to keep that in 
mind as well and also being like monsoon season  
doesn't mean it rains all day it just might be 
cloudy for most of the day and you'll probably get  
an hour or two of rainfall in the afternoon so 
it's not too bad anyway we hope you guys have  
found this video helpful in some way if you have 
give it a thumbs up and subscribe to our channel  
if you want to see our future videos if you 
think we forgot anything let us know down in the  
comments and i'm sure a lot of people coming to 
the philippines want as much information as they  
can get if you're a local and you want tourists 
to know something fire it down into the comments  
we appreciate you guys watching our videos 
and we will see you guys in the next one bye  
you
