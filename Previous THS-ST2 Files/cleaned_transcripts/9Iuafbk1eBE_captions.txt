wasabi is good also
wait, I think it's still early for that
right now, we are going to..
eat Philippine foods, yey
most of it ate by Filipinos when they do not have enough money
yes, in Philippines
that is why our video for today is to let this two crazy Japanese eat filipino foods
right now I am going to introduce the Philippine foods
uhm..
Longganisa (pork sausage)
Hotdog
Tortang sardinas
and this..
sardinas (sardines)
dilis
and this is vinegar
try to smell it
I think the smell gets light
what is this
he's very ugly
this is bagoong
should we comment about the taste honestly?
yup, honestly
we just have to say the truth if we don't like?
you'll like everything, thank you
that annoys me
thank you
you are going to eat all of this with rice
most of it
most of it?
yup, most of it
so eat also the rice while having them
lets try it
which one should we eat first?
or are we going to choose?
should we choose by ourselves?
eat this first

tortang sardinas
its delicious right?
how is it?
ohh, this is delicious

alright next.
the next food is this.
this?
is it the same with this?
yes
what is this?
does it show on the camera?
if you don't have any eggs to do torta, we eat this
I think it is better to eat that with rice
eat that with rice, alright?
ohh, I'd like to eat too
itadakimasu
it's delicious right?
same taste to torta?
show us how filipinos eat it
no, no, of course we eat the same as everyone
you are not going to use your hand right?
yup we don't
I think they use chopsticks..
yes, if we talk about filipinos of course they use chopsticks
we use spoon, what are you talking about
what what?
excuse me, we use spoon
it is delicious
I can't scoop it
delicious !!!!
our next is..
we'll eat this next
I think there is also food like that here
in Philippines, we eat this with vinegar
ohh so we are going to use the vinegar with that
well then, Yugo lets eat
hey wait, I think that's wrong
hey Jade!!
wait it is wrong!
ahh okay..
that is not what we are talking about!
oh it is delicious
it is like the same here in Japan
but how's the vinegar?
does it taste good with it?
the vinegar doesn't taste that much
yeah because you mixed it!!
crazy Japanese!
hey hey wait!
hey!
we are going to choose next
next is this (bagoong)
ha?
this should be the last food!
I told you, it is not a food to eat!
ohh, my nose..

what is inside of it?
uhm.. I think it is shrimp
you are going to eat this with rice
I know you didn't eat anything, eat it!
but the smell
it stinks!
no, eat it
itadakimasu!
it doesn't stinks
the smell is just strong
ohh, it is delicious
yea?
I think he can live in the Philippines forever
why won't you go to the Philippines ?
I don't think I can eat this
it is too salty
Megumi: actually I don't eat too much of that
only sausage just left..
this?
I'll have this
If you judge it by looks, I think I would prefer this one
sana all..
yes! I told you this is number 1
uhm.. for me it's number 2
nothing can defeat this?
this is the one I like the most
for me, I don't really like sausage
but this is sweet that is why I like it
and this is top 2 for me
longganisa and tortang sardinas
final result
we finished it all
we'll start from Yugo to choose the best Top 3 among all
tortang sardinas
this!
Longganisa
this!
dilis!
Longganisa
tortang sardinas
if you will include this, top 3
though I don't really like to eat sausage
I think this is delicious
I won't get fed up
lets hear the filipinos top 3
lets see what is the difference between our choice and them
because Yugo and I have different result also
okay then. Megumi you go first
sorry, I think my decision won't change
Longganisa
and..
I can't choose among of it
tortang sardinas
sardinas
ohh. so top 3 is different to us
how about you Jade?
for me..
Longganisa
so filipinos love it also
yea, we love it
dilis
sardinas
it is completely different
I like this also
ahh yea, both of this is the same right? (tortang sardinas and sardinas)
but you like the original one
this one has egg in it
so you prefer the original one
alright, lets end this video
the result is..
