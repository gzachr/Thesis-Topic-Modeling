here we go let the adventure begin we have no idea 
where we're going look at that same same so cool  
maybe they're going to make fun of me 
they'll catch me here every day wish us luck
the airport struggled we're 
officially at the airport
so the time has come for us to leave quran which 
we are a little bit sad to leave the beautiful  
island but excited to head to the city first we 
arrived in manila and then we took a flight to  
puerto princeso then took a six hour van ride to 
el nido we then took a ferry to koran which was  
about five hours and now we are taking a one-hour 
flight to cebu we are currently going to fly from  
francisco reyes airport which is kind of in the 
center of the big baswanga island it's just a  
short one and a half hour flight and we are flying 
with philippines airlines sometimes the flights  
can be a little bit expensive here from quran so 
if you're ever flying make sure to pick your days  
because there are some good days and good airlines 
that you can find a price that's quite affordable
so far we've had such an incredible time here in 
the philippines and i can't believe that we have  
been here for about two and a half weeks now we 
are ready for a little bit of a change and so far  
you guys have told us that cebu is phenomenal 
there's so much to do there there's a wide  
variety of food of culture or flavor or things 
to do things to see i must admit that traveling  
domestically around philippines has been a breeze 
even to get into the philippines it was relatively  
easy as long as you have all of your documents 
cebu is our fourth stop already in the philippines  
in less than two weeks so we have really hit the 
ground running here so today is a little bit of a  
travel day for us not too much exciting no tours 
happening today but we wanted to make this video  
to also tell you about some of the exciting things 
that we have coming up when we arrive in cebu
time to check in and it's 
pouring with rain wish us luck
thank you okay got my umbrella the sun's out 
but it's pouring with rain here we go here we go  
steps in a puddle
this is our first time taking a little propeller 
plane just like this oh my goodness it's so cool
hello oh thank you it's cramped in here 
it's so tiny are we here right look at that
maybe two
this is awesome let the adventure begin just  
excited to be here it's not 
raining so that's good yes
so we have received our bags and 
now we're going to take a 30 minute  
taxi ride to our hotel we are in makta 
now but our hotel is in cebu city  
throughout our trip here in the philippines 
you have sent us so many recommendations  
so we wanted to ask if you could please send 
as many as you can while we're here in cebu  
send us attractions things to do food to 
eat because we will be here for a while
right so we have checked into our 
hotel but we are really hungry so  
we're just walking straight out our hotel 
we're gonna try and find something to eat  
we were greeted with some sunny weather here 
in cebu i'm so happy to be in some sun some  
good weather and already we can tell that 
the scenery and the area are so different  
we can see jollibee we can see lots of malls 
lots of traffic it's not as chaotic as manila  
i would say it's definitely alive and we didn't 
see things like jollibee in the islands so it's  
kind of nice to be back in the city even though 
we love the islands we are definitely city people
so right now we're actually just walking 
we have no idea where we're going  
but hopefully we're going to 
find something to eat we've  
kind of come to a main intersection right now 
so i'm sure there's going to be a restaurant or  
something we can find there's already so many 
options there's burger king there's jollibee  
but i think we're looking for something else 
besides fast food let's see what we can find
ready
oh look devon you're on this billboard
this is what everybody says i look like same same  
do you think so i think it's you i could 
be on the cultic's end literally you
just from two minutes of being in cebu it's a 
lot busier than we thought it's a big city of  
course but in the next video we will be going out 
and exploring the city and get the full impact of  
what the boo has to offer we're not going 
to give you our first impressions just yet  
so make sure you're subscribed for the next 
video yes we just want to go out now and just get  
something to eat now that we've landed and then in 
the next video we'll soak it all up just from the  
first few minutes of being here we can already 
tell the accent is different i think the cebuanos  
have a little bit more of a spanish accent which 
is quite cool because this is the oldest city  
in the philippines so i'm 
keen to kind of get stuck  
into a little bit of a difference in culture 
different language different maybe food
so we already noticed that there's 
no side cars there's no tricycles  
but they do have the beloved jeep knees and 
actually here they're more like really colorful  
they actually look like they're in a carnival 
they're so beautifully decorated and painted  
it looks like a christmas tree so we're just 
walking down the street and we happen to see  
one of the most beautiful churches i think 
i've ever seen and it's massive they're  
this is beautiful i just researched that it was 
built in 1914 which kind of just shows the history  
here in cebu as chef said it's the oldest city 
in the philippines so i'm so excited to go and  
see more of cebu and kind of experience that 
old culture well i think there's just a lot  
of history here in cebu and i'm kind of keen 
to like uncover that see as much as we can
what's this
okay and what is this nice nice it's 
fries oh okay oh you eat together
so you eat this and the chicken 
ah okay i think okay i think you  
you eat it with your hands that's why 
he's giving you the the plastic one
two one right now bear in mind we're literally 
stopped at the side of the road over here and  
this is the sidecar that we're eating at chicken 
and rice with your hands hey look at the rice look  
at those this is awesome i think you're actually 
supposed to break it in half like this whoa
wow look at that that's the rice and now 
i'm gonna eat it with the chicken i guess  
i think i'm supposed to eat it like this maybe 
you're maybe they're gonna make fun of me like
this okay
is good you're having like a field day 
i know i just i added some sauce onto it  
so i'm gonna try it again just like this tell 
me to feed you yeah okay that'll be easiest  
okay we're like in the traffic but we're 
in the restaurant at the same time oh wow
oh so good it's so good it's so good 
so it was 35 pesos for the chicken  
and only 10 pesos for the rice so 45 peso for 
this whole that's that's actually a full meal  
this is quite an eventful little afternoon that 
we're having who knew but as soon as we walked  
out of our door we knew that we were gonna find 
some interesting and awesome stuff especially  
food so we're just gonna walk a little bit 
more see what else we can find this is quite  
funny because we're we're right in it but yet we 
have no idea where we're going right now we're  
just continuing on this main road and it's mid 
afternoon so the traffic is starting to pick up
so we just passed a sign that 
said authentic mexican tacos  
now if you know us we won't ever 
ever say no to mexican or to taco so  
we're gonna go and have a look because we're 
starving also there is obviously a big spanish  
influence so i'm intrigued to see how good 
like the mexican spanish food is here in cebu
so now that we've arrived in cebu i actually 
put up a little community post asking you guys  
for recommendations anything we should do where 
we should stay where we should eat so thank you  
so much for your recommendations we're going 
to try our best to do as much as we can but  
i'm glad that we came to the city first so we 
can kind of get the lay of the land before we  
start doing all the activities which is kind of 
like our style that's what we like to do first
they have 50 peso tacos we have to get that 
right so to kick off our mexican fiesta we've  
got some nachos cheese guac salsa look salsa 
look at all of this pulled pork oh it's so good
my guilty pleasure in life is ever  
and i don't eat nearly as enough as i should 
so now i'm going to take full advantage of that
so we just received our tacos which were just 50 
pesos by the way and i'm so excited for these and  
we've got this like kind of spicy sauce and i feel 
like i'm just gonna cover mine in spicy sauce am  
i the only one that does that is it just me 
just drowns it in sauce drowns it in sauce
is that too much you can never have too 
much you can never have too much and it's  
like warm freshly made soft tacos 
soft shell taco so i'm gonna dig in
world class tacos i think i'm noticing in the 
philippines it's the sauce that highlights  
the food like you always have to have a special 
sauce with whatever it is but these spectacular  
he's following suit with the sauce browning it 
in sauce and we've got pork onion cilantro soft  
and these tacos are like the 
perfect balance of soft and crispy
50 peso tacos who catch me here every day
the restaurant we're eating at right now is called 
la lucha and i highly highly recommend you try  
them if you're in cebu city because it is probably 
the best mexican food i've had and i've never been  
to mexico but i can already tell it's authentic 
it's so delicious so if you're ever in cebu  
i recommend you try la lucha we'll put the link in 
the description so you can check them out so now
