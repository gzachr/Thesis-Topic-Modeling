Today, we're celebrating our 11th anniversary
and when you're our age
11 years is a huge chunk of your life.
I am so thankful for the 11 blessed years and counting
by God's grace.
They have been blessed years
and I know a lot of viewers...
they like to see all the happy times
but I also like to impress reality.
We've had so many great times together, Imabelle,
but has it always been such smooth sailing?
Oh, of course in every relationship
just like ours
our eleven years and more
they are filled with both
joy
sadness
laughter
and all these other emotions
and circumstances
but what's important is
you really stick to each other
and I was just telling Travis that
we have similarities
we also have differences
but I'm thankful. What's good about the differences that we have
is that we compliment each other.
Exactly.
People ask me a lot,
"Travis, with your job and with your opportunities in life
there's so many temptations,
so many opportunities that are available to you.
because I get to travel the world and doing the type of work I do,
There's always, you know, every city I go to
I wouldn't be a lonely guy.
So, why am I with Imabelle?
Well, the reason I'm with Imabelle is
she's strong in so many areas
that I'm weak at.
We compliment each other well.
People think I'm a people person because of the type of work I do
and because I run this channel
but that's really her.
I love that attitude about her.
She's very helpful in doing things in areas that are hard for me to do myself.
And where she's weak in life,
that's where I excel,
that's where my strengths are.
That's very true.
Travis is very artistic,
very creative,
very brilliant in so many things
and those things are not really my forte.
The first time I saw Travis, I was just captured by
this magical smile.
He's so handsome
He's so physically attractive
and all these other things.
And when I started getting to know him better,
I realized how talented,
how brilliant,
how creative he is.
and that is something that
I, myself help him in the same way that he helps me
to grow.
Both of us grow every day.
People always ask us where we met.
A funny story about where we met
Imabelle, where did we meet?
We met at Embassy.
But not the U.S. Embassy.
There used to be
a hot,
happening club back in those days,
11 years ago,
named Embassy.
So I met Imabelle there.
I spotted her on the dance floor
and I smiled at her.
Do you remember that?
Of course.
That smile was just...wow!
And of course from that time on
I'm just so glad I got to know him better
and I realized how great of a man he is.
He's talented,
He's brilliant,
he's smart
and he's got this great heart.
So look at us now.
And there's so many things about Imabelle
that I really respect.
How she's very strong emotionally,
how she's very strong physically,
she's not shy at all.
I'm more of an introvert.
She's a total extrovert.
She really strengthens everything about me.
just through that kind of inspiration
Seeing how you're not shy
how you're a go-getter
how you're aggressive.
It's really inspiring.
And just one of God's words
both of us grow each day.
We are transformed from glory to glory
as a couple and as individuals.
There are also tough times along the way
There were
rough times
difficult times
aside from those awesome, happy times, of course.
And, Imabelle, we've been together 11 years
that I've known you now,
what do you think the future holds for us?
I just see great things are still going to happen to us.
As we do our part, and of course,
that is something that God has in store for us.
Well, I know that,
we're not always going to have great times
but any time we hit a rough patch
it's nothing but a bump in the road.
And we're going to do so many more great things
we're going to go places
and we're going to make a lot of people happy
and we're just going to enjoy our lives together.
We are all blessed to be a blessing to others.
So that's what we're doing, guys, for you as well.
That's a nice swimsuit. Who gave it to you?
Travis gave it to me and I love it.
When I saw this swimsuit
I knew I had to have it for Imabelle.
Imabelle is
taking me to church right now.
I don't necessarily have all the same beliefs
as Imabelle when it comes to this stuff
but she definitely introduced me to
spirituality
and accepting some of this stuff.
Just a few years ago
I thought it was all a lot of bunk.
I'm a very skeptical person
and I like to stick with what's proven
but Imabelle has definitely shown
me that there's something to this.
even if we don;t have all the same beliefs when it comes to this stuff.
Well, I'm very glad to hear that from Travis
and I know that
when you have strong faith,
it just makes things more beautiful.
I called earlier. They said they have a 6:30 PM service
apparently, that 6:30 PM service is in the main church, not here.
Oh, different location.
So, because of the confusion,
we're going to try to go to our normal church
but it's kind of late
it's almost over. We don't know if we're going to make it.
and there's a bit of a long line towards the taxis.
I think we're too late for the church service now.
So it's too late to make it to
our regular church.
But I think it's not a waste because
in this area
there's a place I want to take Imabelle for a very special evening.
I feel bad that we missed church
since we are late for the other church that we usually go to
we're just going to go to where Travis is taking me to.
I'm excited
Oh, wow, 11 years.
You guys met here?
We met here.
We met at the Fort
at Embassy
The club called Embassy.
It's called something else now.
That was a long time ago.
Are you usually here at GMA Network
Yeah, GMA, mostly
and ABS-CBN.
She used to work at ABS-CBN actually
She worked there for many years.
An eventually I did freelance work
I manage him, his projects
The new projects, acting projects
and then we also have other work to do
I manage tours.
She works in tourism too.
I think I first
heard about you, about the adobo cooking video
That's the old video.
Was it the 1st video that went viral?
Yeah, the first one that went viral.
That's one of the very first videos I did.
Really, I was still just practicing
when I made that video.
Back then, they didn't even have the term "viral video".
But now I've been very blessed
to have some success in this life.
What do you want?
For your toenails?
Yeah.
It feels very interesting.
How are you feeling?
It's very nice
it's very relaxing.
It's actually the first time that I ever got anything like this before.
I've never gotten my feet and my hands done
quite like this before.
We have some popcorn.
Hi.
Are you awake?
Yeah.
