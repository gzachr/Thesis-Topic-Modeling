good morning from Kuala Lumpur we're up really 
early this morning it's about 4 30 and we're  
staying in a hotel called tune which cost us 
180 Ringgit a night we're about a 50 minute  
ride from Kuala Lumpur Airport and we stayed 
here because we wanted to be up early in the  
morning to leave because we're flying to the 
Philippines today we're getting picked up at  
five o'clock and the airport pickup is included 
in the price with the hotel and it includes  
breakfast we're going to show you our journey to 
Manila and then when we get there show you around
morning sir good morning our flight's at 
about 8 15. but if you live in Manila or  
if you've been to the Philippines 
we really want your recommendations  
we're going to be in the Philippines 
for at least a month and we'd really  
love to know what to eat where 
to visit and what to do [Music]
okay so far so good we're checked in 
our flight looks like it's scheduled  
a leave on time there's no delays 
but I'm really surprised at how busy  
the airport is at this time in the 
morning let me just check the time
it's 5 50 and it's really really busy look at this
there was just one thing that we needed to prepare 
in advance for anyone traveling to the Philippines  
at the moment you need to submit an e-travel 
registration anytime up to 72 hours before you  
travel and you just put your vaccination details 
in there and the name of the hotel that you're  
staying at once you've submitted that you then get 
a QR code which you need to show when you check in  
foreign
okay so we're in the Philippines 
so we've made it past immigration  
we're here for 29 days we might extend 
and stay for longer we're not sure but  
there's two things we need to do now we need 
to find a money exchange oh three a SIM card  
a date the same and a grab taxi so first 
things first let's find a money exchange
[Music]
okay so first job done so we've got some money 
and the money exchange in the airport here at  
Manila it seems to be quite competitive when 
we check the rate on Google and the rate in  
the airport there was only a tiny little 
difference and usually when you get money  
changed at the airport I usually expect to pay 
a little bit more um for the fee but it doesn't  
seem to be the case here in Manila so we've got 
money now just looking for a day at the same
check the price how many unlimited 
unlimited um valid for 30 days okay
um
I don't really need that much
yes 40 gigabytes is enough yeah yeah 
I think this one's good for me one yes  
sure no problem thank you I just need your phone
so for 40 gigabytes in dollars 
it's 18 and that's for 30 days okay
and this network so we're 
going to be traveling around
do you need my password okay that's job number 
two done I've got a date the same with a company  
called globe and it cost 1 000 pesos and that gets 
me 40 gigabytes of data there were bigger packages  
available if you want to pay 1 500 pesos you can 
get I think 100 gigabytes of data put them with  
another company smart you can get unlimited 
data for me 40 gigabytes I think is more than  
enough and Jerry's just looking now for a grab 
and I think I grab taxi to our Airbnb which is  
about a 25 to 30 minute ride from here should be 
about how much Jerry 280 pesos 280 pesos brilliant
cool so we're in the grab now and it's how much  
255 255 pesos and I think the journey is 
about 20 minutes to Makati in Manila [Music]
thank you
we've been here once before but this is the first 
time in Manila so we went to Palawan in 2018 yeah  
thank you and for your information the nearest 
mall is waltermart it's two minutes to walk  
from the condo is that green belt no it's a 
Walter Martin okay yeah okay and I rather any  
recommend any restaurants near here that you

thank you so much that's really nice
good yeah I like it
where's the light for the bathroom [Music]
yeah I was thinking 23 meters squared I was 
thinking it was going to be a little bit small  
but it's not this is a good this is this has got 
a separate bedroom it's got somewhere here to  
work it's got the kitchen area I think it's got 
everything and I'm really surprised because we  
just found out from Alan that there's a gym in a 
swimming pool here that's something that I didn't  
recognize when I made the booking so that's on 
floor six and we'll show you that later but this  
is nice let's see if we've got a good view 
of this window oh we've got a balcony oh wow
oh this is really nice I still feel like I'm in 
Kuala Lumpur with all the high-rise buildings so  
we're all checked into the Airbnb and we're really 
happy with it um it's fantastic the facilities are  
good nice and convenient and we're staying in an 
area which is called Makati and I believe Makati  
is really popular with first-time visitors to the 
Philippines this is our first time in Manila so  
we're going out to have a look at a few places 
have a look around just to get a feel for the  
area and then tomorrow we've got a few things 
planned we're going to be out all day and we're  
going to share our first impressions but we're 
looking for lots of recommendations for local  
people we want to know what to eat what to see 
where to go we've got a few ideas but if you've  
got any information any local people have got any 
information for us we'll really appreciate that
hello
Julian
I wonder if the Dewey and he is as 
expensive it's in Thailand yeah it does  
so when we were doing our research it online 
it looks like one of the things that is really  
really popular in Manila is malls it seems like 
there's another a lot of malls here we're gonna  
head to one now called Greenbelt have a look 
around in there see if we can find some food  
to try and then tomorrow we've got a couple of 
other malls that we want to check out uh we're  
not sure which one's the most popular are which 
ones the most famous but we're hoping to find out
we're not really interested in shopping for any 
clothes or anything like that we're really hungry  
and we're looking for a traditional Filipino dish 
which is called adobo we've been taught that we  
can get this dish either as chicken or pork so 
we're gonna have a look around them all and see  
if we can find some adobo and I want a dessert 
I want something called Halo Halo let's have a  
look around here and see if we can find any food 
court or any restaurants I'm sure there should be
okay all right so there's no food court in 
Greenbelt Mall but there's a few restaurants  
outside so we'll check out these restaurants 
see if we can find any adobo here if we can  
great if not we'll see if there's anything else 
but we definitely want Filipino food restaurant  
outside okay I'm not sure why they sell that in 
that type of restaurant that's a little bit fancy  
yeah so we're not sure whether we're going to be 
able to find any adobo here but we'll ask someone  
we'll see if we can find it I am tempted to try 
Jolly B and we could go there but I just really  
want to try some adobo first time can you help 
me we're we're looking to find a restaurant that  
sells adobo is there anywhere in here where 
we could get adobo be a quick change of plan  
we can't find any adobo in the Greenbelt Mall 
but we're really hungry and we're just outside  
Jolly B so we're going to give this a try 
today and we'll find some adobo tomorrow
I think I might try this chicken ala King 
pie do you know what you want I know what  
I want can I order a chicken sandwich meal yes 
um chicken sandwich meal and a super meal beef  
yes and a Choco Malo pie 
we're about to drink sir um
for you um large or regular 
size regular for me is okay
what
okay Jerry we're just waiting for 
my food to come but don't wait for  
me so try yours and tell me what you 
think what I have is the fried chicken  
and three spring rolls in here they are 
Shanghai surprise rainbow and spaghetti [Music]
hello
the salt a little bit spicy all right
my first time to find this Shanghai I'm gonna 
try from the street for the next time this one  
is my first time I never tried this 
before quite nice I'm gonna try one
what's inside
I think it's B okay I'm gonna try my burger 
that's up your burger my rice oh guess what  
I was looking at this and I thought this was 
my burger and I thought I don't want to be  
negative and I don't want to complain but 
in my mind I was thinking oh what do I say  
about this burger because I was thinking 
this burger is a lot smaller than I was  
expecting but luckily this is not the burger 
I'm still waiting for that this is Jerry's rice
again
that's nice I like it that's not 
too spicy actually a little bit  
it's a little bit but women compare The 
Bolognese you know what I mean Balinese
when compared to a difference
it tastes like if you compare it with the same 
KFC or McDonald's do you think it's similar I  
don't think there's a different taste different 
taste okay and so on what taste did you like  
more and I'm not sure in Thailand KFC a little bit 
more spicy but this one not spicy but it's tasty  
quite nice not too spicy for this and how much 
did they come to all together for two meals  
and I think with two times I think 455 okay source 
which is really good not expensive at all okay so  
this box is more like it this is definitely the 
size I was hoping for let's have a look at this  
so this is a chicken sandwich okay so the burgers 
are definitely different they're sorry the bun I  
should say is definitely different to a burger 
that you get at KFC for example let's have a try  
first time trying Jolly B
it's nice I like it
Jerry's hands is like that he's holding 
the GoPro but his hands like that dying  
for a bite it's mine all mine I like it it's 
nice no spicy not spicy if you want to try
come on
let's see
the flavoring is
thank you I saw an apple yeah I like it
so this is the first Jollibee but I don't think  
it'll be the last I think we'll 
definitely be coming here again
[Music] that's the coffee 29.
okay
oh this area seems a lot but if 
you have all of a sudden doesn't it
so we're at Santa Land
sausages
I want to try salon tomorrow for 
breakfast is a traditional breakfast dish
[Music] yeah meatball
hello
thank you
this is like a huge Market isn't it yeah 
[Music] a lot of tricycles here there's  
a lot of little stalls that have just been 
set up in the streets selling clothes fruit
I'm okay thank you
[Music]
thank you
oh that's so beautiful
walk for about an hour through the city center 
and we've arrived at this place which is called  
cecipi we were heading to be a walk and I 
think Beer Walk was about a 20 minute walk  
from here but as you can see in the background 
we spotted this view with its gorgeous sunset  
and we've made a detour and we've come 
along here instead look at this [Music]
perfect so I think we're going to walk around 
here instead and then I think Beer Walk is  
over this direction we'll head over there soon 
but we just we want to have a look around here  
so it's really busy it's about 
what time is it let me check
it's quarter past six but there's loads of people  
here and it's still quite warm 
but this Sunset is just fantastic
[Music]
I don't know
