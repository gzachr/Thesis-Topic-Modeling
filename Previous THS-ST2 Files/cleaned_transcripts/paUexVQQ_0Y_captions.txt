we're going to head to the market see what 
we can find hopefully try some traditional  
foods and just some other foods as well sorry 
there is you coming we've obviously got like  
the list of must tries that we're gonna try and 
find like was it chicken adobo chicken adobo uh  
we're gonna try and find sisig and i don't know 
what else whatever what was that dessert you had  
oh hello halo maybe if you can find that that 
sounds exciting and then i guess we'll just  
see what else we come across right let's go 
okay so we've come down to the makato central  
and it doesn't seem like there's too many stalls 
here but we're gonna take a look around and see  
what we can find also i don't think we're gonna 
find much filipino food it seems to be more  
uh other countries so it's a chicago stall 
and this is the korean store next to us so  
we're gonna have a look around so we can find it 
okay so we hit the chicago store first and they  
had like mac and cheese and lasagna they had some 
garlic bread but we've gone for some roast beef  
and mashed potato because it looked so 
good they look good some mashed potato
first pretty good mashed potatoes i've got a 
knife so i'm just going to bite into the beef
that's a big chunk of beef that is oh
not bad pretty good to be bad 
is it cold it's not that warm
much looks good anything do you want to 
try actually go straight in for this beef
oh
it's very chewy yeah i think it's because 
it's a really big slice maybe it's going  
to be a bit more tender because i thought it 
was it looked like quite it's like like finely  
sliced into the thing but no it's quite quite 
thick it's quite chewy the gravy is really good
the mash is really good too the one thing 
philippines seems to do well is gravy  
yeah and i didn't think that was a thing before 
coming this has turned out to be a little bit of  
a fail there's not really that many stalls um some 
of them are like not even open but they're there  
yeah so the beef was nice yeah um but yeah i think 
we're gonna head into the shop mob so that's what  
the glorietta four and find a restaurant there's 
bound to be a restaurant doing filipino food  
yeah the aim of the aim of the day was to try 
filipino food so yeah we're gonna we're gonna  
make sure we do that yeah we're gonna find the 
restaurant filipino restaurant hopefully yeah have  
some dishes maybe get one each then a stiff front 
yeah and hopefully some dessert hopefully that's  
the plan okay so we run around the shopping malls 
and we couldn't find anywhere that was doing like  
filipino traditional food so we had a quick look 
on google maps and we've come down to a place  
called mesa which is in green belt five basically 
the area is just one big shot more it's insane but  
yeah we come to the mesa it does traditional 
filipino food we've ordered a couple of dishes  
so when it comes we'll show you what we got and 
then we will taste it okay so food is alright  
it looks delicious so this is the chicken 
and pork adobo we've got a garlic rice a  
boiled rice and this is the sisig honestly i 
couldn't tell you what was in the city i think  
we might have to do a bit of googling first it 
looks interesting it's definitely onion pour
i don't know what the white stuff is it looks 
like some sort of like sauce almost but i'm  
not really sure i guess we'll just give it a try 
with a [ __ ] face and we'll have a nervous guy
he's on a big hot griddle santa's gonna be fine
oh very quickly
is it crispy or chewy
crispy
a little bit chewy then it just tastes like 
really really tiny tiny bits of crispy coffee  
wow yeah bit similar to that okay it's got a 
flavor to it i don't know what the flavor is  
i'm presuming that's where this white sort of 
sauce is do you choose the calamansi not really  
not strongly anyway i'm pleasantly surprised 
yeah yeah i thought that's gonna have like a  
really strong flavor it doesn't really 
get oh it looks like they're tired
it doesn't smell too strong no
there's a taste is there some 
taste in there that's like  
i don't know what it is 
yeah i don't know what it is
pretty good though that's a really good appetizer 
then we picked up a chicken pork adorable  
um i'm not 100 sure what a door ball is but i'm 
going to go for some garlic rice with it as well
it's really tender
that's pretty good i can't describe 
the taste but the meat is really tender  
and the garlic rice is really good 
as well okay so i'm going for some  
pork chelsa's going to grab some of the 
chicken go for it with some garlic rice
that's really good that rice is really garlicky  
yeah it is slick yeah it's good 
i'm really impressed yeah yeah
it's important
like that really tender yeah it's 
really good for your thoughts that was  
delicious it was really really good i think my 
favorite probably was the pork and chicken adobo  
yeah i did like the chicken more 
than the pork if i had to choose  
so like if they did like on their own chicken 
adorable yeah and then a pork adorable i  
would pick the chicken one i'd probably 
pick the pork who would you yeah nice um  
but yeah overall really really tasty the garlic 
rice was lovely and really nice it's like addition  
a really nice like addition to your food and 
it goes i guess everything yeah i think um  
dessert it's gonna be a struggle but we're gonna 
have to try it yeah i think we're gonna have one  
dessert between us because i don't think we could 
do one each yeah so we'll see what they've got  
yeah normally when we try the 
traditional meals from each country  
we normally just have like a small bit 
i guess i don't know and then we end up  
eating more foods because we come to a proper 
restaurant to try we've ended up having like a big  
meal each and we bought absolute stuff but yeah 
we're gonna get dessert we're gonna try it and  
we need to choose one there's two in 
mind i think we need to get just one  
we've gone for the leche flan did i 
say that right i think so leche flan
i guess that's interesting i 
don't know if it's hot or cold
okay
and the sermon is very sweet very 
sweet it's not as creamy as custard
i can't describe it it's nice it's absolutely 
drenched in caramel it smells like caramel
yeah like i can't explain it
it's very very unique i've never 
had anything like that before  
the custard just it just like falls apart in 
your mouth i don't know you don't even have  
to chew it just like you could like 
suck it and it just like dissolves
the taste is myself it's very caramelly yeah
yeah we're back in the hotel now we were 
undecided whether or not to go for some drinks  
or come back so we decided to 
pick up some drinks from 711
the old red horse we've got some funky colored
whatever these are kind of 
like a wkd i guess is it  
they're pretty colors pretty much why i picked 
them up but we've come back even though we had  
a morning just full of work we have some things to 
catch up on we have things to plan we have things  
to book yeah so we've come back we're gonna end it
