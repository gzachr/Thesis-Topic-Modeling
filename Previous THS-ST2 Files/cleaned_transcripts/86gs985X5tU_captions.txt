I'm gonna taste this pork belly.
We're at MFK by Aysee, and today we are going to try some kambayan.
Located in Anaheim, MFK stands for modern Filipino kitchen.
The guy covered the table with banana leaves and is burning them with a torch to kill the germs and to make it shiny.
Then the chef brought out the feast.
Look at all the food.
This is how you would set it up.
You put some rice, lumpia, and more toppings.
And this is what it looks like when it's finished.
Don't you wish you to eat some of this yum yum?
The server is going over the different sauces.
[Server] This one would be spicy vinegar. Sweet chili sauce. And it's pretty much like an all around meat sauce, a bit on the sweeter side.
Time to eat wait.
Wait, we're not supposed to use the plates. We're supposed to eat off of the banana leaves.
The word kamayan literally means to eat with your hands, but I'm going to use a fork because it's less messy.
I'm gonna try a lumpia.
Brother likes the sausages and especially the fruits.
Are we gonna finish all this food?
Our meal also comes with a specialty drink made with purple yam.
Now I'm gonna try some ube horchata.
I gave it a thumbs up.
Last dish that arrived was the sisig.
This is a Filipino dish made from parts of pig's head and liver.
Let me try a little bit.
Let's speed things up.
I am stuffed and there is still so much left over.
We had a yummy time here. Learn more at mfkaysee.com
