Miss Philippines.
 25. Mama LuLu. Miss Philippines!
Miss Philippines what are we cooking today?
I'm cooking two things today, both Pancit.
Palabok over there.
Pancit Bihon over there.
And why are you cooking two things today miss Philippines?
They said that Pancit  (noodles) is for a longer life.
Since I had a birthday on August 3,
this is just a continuation.
At the tender age of 64 years old.
Yes.
Life is buhay (life in tagalog). Buhay is life.
Let's connect all of the noodles for a longer life.
We are starting with pancit bihon.
First off, we have cabbage that I cut like noodles.
Excellent (noodle brand) bihon.
Like vermicelli noodles.
Yes.
Garlic.
Onions.
Carrots.
Chopped like the noodles as well.
 Celery.
Chicken.
I boiled the chicken, I took out the bones and skin, and I shredded it.
What will make our pancit delicious, calamansi (citrus).
Makes your life sour.
Salt and pepper.
Knorr chicken powder.
And of course the oil and soy sauce.
They will never go missing.
The broth that you boil the chicken here.
So that it will be flavorful and scrumptious.
Instead of water that's what you will use.
Yes, but if our noodles are still hard,
we will add a little more water.
OK, let's start.
Of course, don't forget.
My two spatula.
Made in the Philippines.
The handle is wood.
That's my favorite.
You use it for spanking.
Yes.
It's double purpose.
Alright we will now open the stove. Please open it.
Not that.
Oh no.
Because on my camera...
Do you want me to get burned.
Let's put our oil.
Just a little bit.
We don't want to make our pancit too oily.
Let's heat it first before we put our ingredients.
By the way, these are imported.
Do you know where I got these from?
Divisoria.
My daughter souvenir from the Philippines.
The oil is now hot, so now we will put our garlic.
Let's put our onions.
When I'm cooking pancit I always think there's a birthday.
Because this is our favorite we always have pancit
Look it has a different color now.
We will now put our chicken.
Smells good.
This will cook for about 15 minutes.
So the chicken will be a little more cooked
I thought the chicken was already cooked?
Yes it's cooked, but it's only boiled.
But it's different when you actually sauté it.
It means I'm sautéing it.
Basically you're incorporating the flavor
in the oil.
Now put the pepper.
About 1 teaspoon.
Let's put the carrots.
Mixing mixing.
I would just like to point out that my mom lied.
Because it's not even 15 minutes and already put the carrots in.
I said when you smell it and the color changes right?!
My mom's estimate is wrong, because she didn't pass math.
So, I also inherited it from her.
So please excuse our estimate.
Alright.
I admit it.
My grade in math was 76, 78.
But at least I passed.
We will now put our celery.
We will now put a little bit of the broth.
Because it seems dry now.
Just a little bit.
So it will-
So it won't stick in the pan.
We will put a little bit of soy sauce.
Since there is soy sauce we will not put salt.
Of course our favorite.
Please sponsor us, knorr chicken powder.
You are my mom's favorite.
Yes.
I can never live without it
How many tablespoon of the knorr chicken powder.
Two.
Mix it all together.
When you have time.
We will now put our cabbage.
We will mix it for about five minutes.
You don't really need it to be too cooked.
We will get some of it, and put it as our topping later when our pancit cooks.
And also the vegetables that we used can be eaten raw.
So we don't need to cook it, it needs a bit of crunch.
Yes.
Now we will take some vegetables and reserve it as a topping for our pancit.
But we will not get all of them because we want to mix it as well with our noodles.
Where did you learn your technique to transfer and for topping?
You will learn that from watching and from your mother as well.
We will now put the rest of our broth.
All of it.
Yes.
Because we will now put our pancit.
Others mom, they soak the pancit?
You wet it, so that it'll break apart.
You can do that it doesn't matter.
Soaking it is to speed up the process so it'll cook quicker.
You just wet it with the broth.
So that it'll soften.
You have to be patient and waiting for it to soften the noodles.
You have to help the noodles soak the broth.
So it'll absorb all of the broth.
It'll take long, so I'll just wait and be patient.
When it finally softens, it'll be fast from then.
The first batch is soft.
We will now put the second one.
That's why I don't soak it in water first because it becomes soggy.
So make sure to soften it carefully.
I think that is hard about this is the mixing.
You just want to surrender.
And raise your two armpits.
We will put soy sauce.
To make it more flavorful and to also color it.
About 1/3 cup.
1/3 cup of toys.
Soy sauce.
Tip.
This is for putting all of the seasoning ingredients,
it's all guesstimate and up to your taste.
But of course we wanted to be flavorful and delicious.
Put the heat on medium.
Let's put one cup of water.
We put it at medium so that it will not stick to the pan.
If you see that it still has a bland color,
and bland on taste.
You can add more soy sauce or fish sauce.
It depends on you what you want.
But for me I put soy sauce not salt or fish sauce.
Pancit is very easy to cook.
All of us can cook it.
All it is is patiently mixing it all together.
Especially if there is a lot, it's really hard to mix it.
You will get muscles.
You cannot avoid having muscles.
Now of course I will have to taste it.
You know I don't want to get embarrassed.
I am Loreta.
Miss LuLu's pancit is now cooked.
That's how easy it is.
We will now put this aside and cook our palabok.
Now we are finished with our pancit bihon.
We will cook palabok!
Over there.
Our pancit palabok.
Lug-Lug.
As in LuLu.
I soaked it overnight.
When we're finally cooking it the next day, we will boil it for 5 to 10 minutes to soften it completely.
Pork belly 1 1/2 pounds.
We will cook it like Chicharrón, crispy for sauce.
Five packages of firm tofu.
Crumble it all, or use a fork to do it but it has to be very mushy. 
It's for our sauce, it is the most important thing.
This is garlic and onion.
This is for our garnish onion spring.
I mean spring onions.
Calamansi. For the sourness.
And boiled eggs for decorations.
So it's delicious.
Our cornstarch to make our sauce even thicker.
This one is one of my siblings.
Chicharrón.
I already crushed it. I smashed it with a hammer.
A topping and for deliciousness.
Of our high blood.
This one is for video purposes.
So you will see how I soften the noodles.
The water is boiling and I will put it in now.
Just put it in.
Make sure to do it slowly. Be careful!
Leave it alone for 5 to 10 minutes so that it'll soften.
Now let's open another burner for our sauce.
Now that our pan is heated.
We will now put the pork belly.
Oliver asked why is there a blue marker on the pork.
It's a reminder of what their name is.
I didn't put oil, because sometimes the pork gets watery.
But today, it's dry.
It has no water.
That's why you can put a little bit of oil.
Just a little bit, because it'll get oily by itself.
That's not a small amount of oil.
Yes us a little bit only.
It's a lot of this one cup.
Just keep mixing it
Look at it it's browning.
We will wait until it's brown a little bit.
Before we will put the garlic and onions.
Let's take a look at this and it might be ready.
Yes, it's ready.
Let me turn it off.
We now drained our noodles.
See it is now soft.
While we're waiting for the rest, we will now get started on our sauce.
That is ready, we can now put our garlic.
It's one whole big garlic.
We will put in high heat again.
When the garlic smells really good, I can now put the onions.
Why pork first?
We're using the pork's natural fats to cook the garlic and onions.
And of course it's to make it more delicious.
We will now put our onions.
One whole onion.
Because the onion makes it even more flavorful and delicious.
Let's mix it all together.
Let's leave it alone for five minutes.
Let's get our annatto seed ready.
Hurry make a slogan.
We will put the another seed in the oil.
Just make sure to see how much you really need.
We put annatto seed so that we can have a beautiful color.
Orange like, kare-kare.
Yes.
About three packages.
Because we have a lot of tofu.
It already colored it.
Because it's already been incorporated,
we will put a little bit of ground pepper.
About 1 teaspoon.
Because you can still put some more after it's cooked.
Up to you how much you put.
And our......
Knorr chicken powder!
About 2 tablespoons.
Mix mix.
OK.
Tofu!
There.
Mix it very well.
Why does it have tofu?
That's what creates the sauce and makes it flavorful.
The other kind of palabok,
they only put cornstarch for thickener only.
But for this, this is the main thing to make the sauce.
This one I learned from my mom.
After it cooks for 10 minutes you will put water.
We will wait a little bit for the tofu to cook.
While we wait, please look at my beauty.
joke, joke, joke.
In the Philippines they put tinapa (smoked milk fish)
and chicharron.
Here in America, it's hard to find tinapa.
And some people don't eat fish.
A lot of Filipinos in America got used to only putting chicharron on top.
And the type of palabok I do is with tofu.
This one has thick noodles.
But declious.
You know, fat is delicious.
I have a question that I'm sure a lot of people want to know.
My question is.
What region did the different kinds of palabok come from?
In Malabon.
Pancit Malabon.
The other one, Pampangga.
I think this one is from Pampangga because I learned this from my Mom
because my Mom has Kapangpangan in her blood.
After 10 minutes watch for 2 cups of water.
Let it boil for 10 to 15 minutes.
 10 minutes has passed.
This is our finale.
The fish sauce and corn starch.
To make the sauce is thicker.
If you don't want fish sauce, you can put salt that's the only alternative.
Just guesstimate guesstimate.
Mix.
If you mix it you have to shake it.
Come on shake it shake it shake it.
You thought I didn't know how to shake it?
But you didn't mix it though.
There you go.
Now our corn starch. Hold on I'm going to mix it.
Yes guesstimate how thick you want it, don't put all of it.
There, just a little bit that's enough for now.
Let's just wait for it to boil, after it boils we will turn it off.
And we will serve it!
Me and Olly are waiting!
Of course me and Olly are the first one to taste it.
We are finished cooking!
All the dishes that we cooked are ready.
Over there!
You're wondering why we have a lot of water.
It's for emergency purposes.
There's a lot of people asking why we have a lot of water.
Yes.
It's hard to buy, it's sold out sometimes.
It's better if we have some in stock.
You know we need water for our sexy body.
This is our pancit.
That's our toppings over there.
The one I reserved earlier.
This is our sauce for our palabok.
And this is our noodles.
Noodles.
I put the whole thing there, because I don't want to serve a lot.
Because sometimes people can't finish it, and it goes bad.
It's a waste.
I put it there so that if anyone wants, I can serve them individually.
Do we understand each other kids?
Let's put our toppings on top,
Especially for birthdays or gatherings,
of course it's great to have vegetables and toppings on top.
Of course we will put garnish on top as well.
It's to add more deliciousness.
There.
Others at gatherings, I see them put egg on top.
Yes there. On top.
The cut up boiled egg.
On the pancit.
Yes pancit.
But me I don't want to put in.
We will now serve a little bit on the plate.
So we can all see it.
Of course we need to add the sourness.
Calamansi.
Two is enough.
Our face might get sour.
If it's too much.
Next one is our palabok.
We will put the sauce of course.
We will mix it so we can incorporate it very well.
Of course we will put the chicharron.
It depends on you how much chicharron you want to put.
That is on you.
More?
Yes, that's what makes it delicious
When you're eating and then you...
We will put garnish. (spring onions)
There.
 We will put egg.
It's up to you if you want to cut it vertically or horizontally.
Not but not the least,
our calamansi.
Here they are!
Pancit Bihon and Palabok.
Now, it is up to you what you want to eat first.
Iny Meany my Nemo.
But I think I'll eat it at the same time.
Here it is so let's taste it.
But we have to squeeze our calamansi.
Yum, the smell is sour.
Am I in paradise?
It's not good if it doesn't have this.
It's hard.
But it's good.
OK next, we will taste the pancit.
Of course we also need to squeeze the calamansi.
Hold on.
 We need pepper.
So it's good
Is there no bread?
The pancit is delicious.
Mommy, are you going to end a video?
I thought it was done!
You're just eating there.
Yes, it's good.
Ending. Hold on. End the video.
What the-
Not yet, like comment and subscribe remember?
Oh my God.

EEDJIOTS!
Go away.
You might eat my food.
You're not going to give me some?
Later when I finish.
Hold on. This is mine.
You thought the video ended?
I'm still here.
I have a tip.
I bought a container you see here.
You can start a business.
Or you can give this away when there is a special occasion.
To your friends.
But with the ingredients, it's up to you how you want to calculate the price.
It's up to you what you want to do with your life.
Let's buy!
