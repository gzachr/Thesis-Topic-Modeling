Whatsup people, welcome to a new episode here in the Philippines
so after our trip to Tagaytay we actually come back home to Manila rest for few days and now it begins a
new trip so today we are here in Coron
already so in next few days we're gonna explore 
around coron and El Nido to show you guys some of the  
best landscape around so I know Coron and El Nido 
is very famous for Limestone close like the ones  
in Krabi in Thailand and also like beautiful clear 
blue water and that's about it because my family  
from Hong Kong is actually coming to visit us in 
the Philippines and we're meeting up in coron so  
my father actually flew in yesterday from Hong 
Kong and then after that my brother he actually  
flew in from Australia Melbourne to uh come and 
join us on this special trip for them super long  
trip but uh it's Alina's first time meeting them 
as well so yeah she's never met my father and my  
brother before so it's gonna be nervous to meet 
your family it's so exciting yeah I think you're  
the best girlfriend that's met my family so it's 
gonna be quite interesting yeah to be honest I'm  
me too and first time meet with like my boyfriend 
family oh really yes first time and it's also this  
is my first ever time vlogging from my family 
so it's gonna be quite interesting experience  
especially speaking English in front of them 
because usually back at home in Hong Kong we  
spoke in uh Cantonese but after years of living in 
Australia and also traveling now my first language  
is English so it's actually my fluent yeah 
Cantonese anyway um I believe when we arrived  
here so they were asking for a lot of hotels 
and we were told that we cannot ride tricycles  
from the airport to our hotel because it's around 
25 kilometers so it's quite far away but anyway  
um you've got a list of hotels here so basically 
when you arrive you just need to say we are from  
say like this hotel and then they will have 
a direct shuttle bus shuttle van if you don't  
tell them Hotel they won't let you go yeah and 
also you'd pay 200 so for entrance yes so to  
enter Quran just then as you saw there was an 
environmental fee of 300 pesos per person per  
person yeah per person and after that the shuttle 
here condo driver I thought it was free but no you  
have to pay 250 per person again so anyway I think 
it's around the same price as tricycle so it's not  
that much of a big difference and just now just 
now we fly and our plane don't have conditions so  
we don't have icons so it was so hard they even 
say they even say we approach in advance that  
your aircraft's gonna be really hot but in the as2 
it could be cooler but it was so hot just now it  
was a small flight as well it's only 19 rows so 
the flight was going like like this so a bit uh  
scary anyway our minivani is here so um let's 
head out onto it and unless I go to the hotel
you're nervous no I'm nervous of course I'm 
nervous it's okay don't worry my family is  
very nice I think last few few years 
I've become in in introvert yeah don't  
worry just uh tell them some Russian 
words and they'll be so happy okay
okay all right so well welcome to coron 
luckily here I have icon yeah luckily he  
have aircon right how does this work okay 
ah like this so the egg one doesn't go away
what does that mean yeah it's a normal transport 
Transportation like we don't we have buses but  
usually we use gazelka minivans these are called 
minivans yeah yeah it's like a Russian Japanese
with the aircon version
oh never mind around like 15 15 pesos 
15 pesos is around the same price right
I'm so excited to meet my father and my brother  
yeah speaking of uh while we're waiting for 
other passengers honestly I'm gonna talk about  
some background stories so I haven't actually met 
that uh met up with my father for the last five  
years just because coronavirus at the start and 
then after that it was just oh wait before that  
was two years not mad not meeting him and after 
there was coronavirus like in total five years I  
haven't seen it already only uh video call and 
my brother I met him seven months ago so yeah
that's you um yeah it's going to be quite 
interesting for Alina amazing to see how  
they different or the same be family with brother 
how like they behave yeah My Brother Talks a lot  
just heads up my brother is going to talk to you 
a lot okay it helped me improve my yeah exactly  
um because Alina has been saying my English is 
so basic so yeah now I understand everything but  
I think on the drivers yeah
he's waiting for other passengers to think so 
uh yeah I think here in Plano one they don't  
speak Tagalog so they speak a different language 
actually so yeah maybe they'll understand but  
um they don't speak Tagalog here I believe 
because I know around the Philippines there  
are so many different languages I don't know what 
they called here the language palawanis I don't  
know let's anyway let's try to learn some new 
words today and uh something that's similar to it  
okay hello yes hello how are you yes

before we head up maybe um we can go

uh the hill but yeah there's a hill there and 
apparently if you're when you're up there you can  
never see the whole town um it's like one of those 
looks like a chocolate Hill what they call it yeah  
yeah okay yeah get some rest first we'll get back 
to you later yeah I need um yeah maybe maybe we

that's why he's at sunrise [Laughter]
okay a lot of choices there in the town right so 
we've got Thai you've got Spanish and you also  
have even the Korean barbecue as well there's a 
lot of choices in town so go get something grab  
something uh what did you eat we had local food 
uh the local food yeah yeah the seed the seafood
seafood lunch and we also had some sort of pork 
dish pork dish oh actually hold on he ordered a  
squid stuffed grits oh okay barbecue which is 
quite nice very Tender Is it yes it is yeah so  
actually like it very much so we had our lunch 
so one you know one thing that's just going to  
actually grab something to eat first yeah maybe 
and then after we can hit the beach I think you  
want to go to beach ready now the beach is not 
that close to here what is it I think yeah so  
I think you better off is uh get something 
to eat first and then go up the hill and  
see sunset or something oh yeah that sounds 
good yeah then we're gonna go incredibly get  
something afterwards you're just gonna rest a bit 
here yes okay all right yeah long await holiday
all right yes so uh that's uh my family 
guys that's my father very true and my  
brother day three looks so similar like a 
Brothers yeah my father looks very young oh  
so yeah yeah my father 13. not like how old 
is he let's say he's close to 60. yeah let's  
say he's got 60 I don't want to review 
the exacts yeah it's really crazy yeah  
he's uh that's why when he says like oh we're 
Three Brothers we were actually agrees [Music]
yeah this kind of reminds me of uh the local areas 
oh like the islands that I went to Thailand it's  
very natural with fresh air everywhere that's what 
I like finally away from whatever the smoke yeah  
not complaining but Manila it's uh can be quite 
polluted sometimes yeah but anyway let's uh go  
and find a restaurant here and uh from why my 
father said oh this is a petty petty diving flag  
diving yeah Petty diving flag no idea 
Petty diving you know you know when you  
get a certificate for diving you come to 
like one of these places to get the center  
yeah be fine okay in the next few days 
we may be yeah I think so together I  
won't be scared yeah all right let's 
find food I don't know if this side
let's look on Google Map to see what food options 
are there I don't know why but Alina's phone  
actually has better signal than mine even though 
we're using the same plan yeah everywhere like  
this not fair yeah yeah okay anyway where are 
the restaurant options they say there is like  
Thai restaurant Korean barbecue everywhere ask 
your father which way he going oh yeah let me  
ask him let's go back yeah for this trip I 
intentionally brought my uh water slippers  
away from our normal Center they said 
this is which one oh is it this is
great yeah let's see more I think many people 
like so famous I don't see a tourist where is the  
tourists it's good that we are not in a tourist 
area for me I don't like going to tourist area I  
like going to the beach and open path and uh yeah 
I like going to local places I know I mean this  
is a hotel straight I think anyway we're in the 
main town so yeah it looks so modern and simple  
and it's cheap yeah it's at a good price I would 
say I wouldn't say it's cheaper it's a good price
all right so we begin on a hunt to find some 
food here in the Philippines in Corona I mean  
and if we go up the hill apparently we are 
just a couple minutes away from the main  
street in coron town so I believe this is 
it and I'm going to my father they've got  
different things to eat but now it's around 
four o'clock so ideally we don't want to eat  
a lot so we're just gonna eat something small 
my favorite restaurant and dogs chicken yes
fine you're fine
you're okay don't worry
okay it's more a bit more developed than uh just 
now I think they say has more things I think go
it's around small street oh cover your ears 
guys this is uh whoa It's smoke Construction  
there are lots of um tricycle is around too 
but a tricycles looks a bit different this  
looks like one of those are Armored Cars you know 
what I mean I'm a cast that goes to bang and take  
money it's also one of those but modified from 
open the back inside oh actually do we have money  
to buy food yeah we do we still have yeah so you 
have some a couple hundred pesos yeah we forgot
it's okay to be alone
see many tricycles but they 
look so different all of them
oh wow bigger bigger the tricycle is 
a custom yeah custom they try to make  
it something special yeah I think they can 
choose their own colors you know like when you  
it's like when you're in a game when you're 
in a computer game and you can choose choose  
your character and choose your like different 
colors yeah the chocolate colors here look very  
different and see there is this one smaller I 
think hello hello all right what else is there  
I think this is going to get a quick bite so maybe 
like a cafe if you want coffee yeah there's a cafe  
here we can get some Bakery if you want oh 
let's walk around yeah walk around and see
yeah so this is the main coron town and 
you can see lots of tour companies over  
here as well motored by Grand so I 
wonder how much it is for one bike  
uh it doesn't say a price four hours 12 
hours 24 hours so it's got 20 hours it's  
not going today interesting something that uh 
usually in other countries according to days  
and even in other places yeah but I don't 
I don't I don't think we'll be traveling  
around with waterfire to be honest I won 
I know you won but uh yeah but I think  
because we're there four of us and my 
brother they don't drive other bikes  
so very likely they'll take tricycle go find a 
drive drive right your father can drive no can I  
yeah it's not very common to drive a 
motorbike in Hong Kong Australia yeah
super it's a very scared of music I'm telling you 
copyright copyright all right so after walking  
around the streets for another like 15 or 20 
some minutes we just haven't found any lots  
of a good Cafe options or restaurants around 
here I think even though it's a rather tourist  
town here there's not enough um like I guess like 
restaurants or facilities around here even though  
we've got like chicken manok um but uh not now 
not now we were thinking to get something like  
very small like a snack kind of thing um I guess 
like there are restaurants here but there's not  
enough variety but uh there is McDonald's yeah um 
I wanna even I wanna eat Jollibee hot dog yeah if  
they have one yeah they say having a McDonald in 
your area usually it means it's a symbol for like  
your area it's very developed last time when we're 
on our way to uh Pico de oroco our friend uh told  
us that last time yeah I've got McDonald's 
that means this is a very developed town  
yeah let's see what they have actually we have 
never had McDonald's in the Philippines so this  
might be our first reaction of McDonald's as 
well yeah all right anyway let's head right  
in and see what's uh in Philippines 
McDonald's oh through dry fruit throw
Helena cannot pronounce it Justin 
cannot cannot pronounce dressed with you  
no one can no one can Russia there is 
true today all right let's Head Right In  
McDonald's yeah so many people inside yeah I 
think I'll be down for a burger or something yeah
all right ladies first okay
oh so many people in there  
oh it's a nice aircon okay outside or 
super all right let's uh hello hello
all right um let's see what's on the menu so 
whoa we're here in McDonald's in Philippines  
they always have a rise actually they always 
have a horizon very possible meal so uh it's  
like Jolly spaghetti but like uh chick fried 
chicken with spaghetti with tomato sauce  
and they've got the same thing as for mushroom 
pepper steak one thing is different though is the  
um the top the chicken fillet with uh looks like 
corn corn sauce I don't know what that is but it's  
like a sauce and sauce but of course we're gonna 
end it with the McFlurry later so I'm not sure if  
you get the stomach for it I think I think I will 
eat apple pie yeah they they want to go to dinner
and later I think we're gonna try to like I'm 
gonna spend some family time with them later  
so maybe we'll drink like a cup of beer 
and we're gonna try the first impression  
of San Miguel or something so I think it's 
gonna be quite interesting beer yeah only in  
the Philippines I think I think in I'm gonna 
have to but uh anyway yeah let's try to order  
food I don't think I put apple pie will be a 
lot different here so um all right all right
yeah I actually only ordered the Apple 
five I think apple pie in general should  
be somewhat similar to other country 
so there won't be a lot of deviations
not oily so it means um it's 
freshly fried so it's nice not to  
um no what's that word when um the 
chips get very soggy soggy that's a word
and right here we've got a cheeseburger so um 
let's um see first impression our cheeseburger
Yep looks very expanded
meat plants inside and there's 
ketchup but please go to Russia
fine
it's your everyday sitting in 
toilet I Don't Wanna Be recover
y yeah
[Music]
this is Sprite it's more like a water than 
Sprite I don't feel like a gas the bubbles inside
I agree it's very diluted it's not a lot 
of soda inside chips fries were good I  
think it's like very freshly fried you can 
taste it it's not soggy at all right now on  
to the main start of our today's dish you can 
see inside there is some chopped onions some  
pickle tomato sauce so yeah it looks like a 
very standard cheeseburger I guess [Music]
exactly the same no surprise yeah no surprises  
they're all onion not bad all right so after 
McDonald's just then I think to be honest the  
impression of McDonald it's more or less the same 
as other countries apart from the fried chicken  
and rice and those other fishes as well it's quite 
interesting and full disclaimer I would have tried  
a fried chicken but I didn't uh just because of my 
stomach issue I don't want to risk it anyway after  
McDonald's we came back to the hotel which is just 
going to take some rest because we're so tired and  
later the rest and charging our phone and later 
we're gonna go to somewhere maybe interesting  
place yeah maybe we'll go and grab dinner later 
okay let's go private boat tour USA tomorrow  
Private Island yep oh how many you said I 
saw in your message he said six islands six  
islands six islands and there are more 
places to go tomorrow how much uh 3500  
um for the whole group just for the boat yeah and 
then um there's every island there is actually  
a tax or something that we have to pay like 
150 yeah usually there is one yeah so that's  
um so that works out quite well I mean if you 
go around six islands then we have to pay 600  
something per person something for the whole 
group yeah maybe that's my person yeah that's a  
per person so the 3500 is for the boats right yep 
for the whole boat and then on top then we have we  
have to rent out the alcaya oh okay so we will tow 
for Kaya to uh by the vote to the destination and  
then go around and then we can actually jump on 
the kayak and kind of like that's nice yeah yeah  
okay tomorrow yeah let's do it so what happened 
is that it's actually we start at seven o'clock  
um the guy the tour guide will actually come and 
pick us up and we go to market to buy something  
so that he can cook on the boat for us oh all 
right he cooks yes wow and uh no actually there's  
a there's a there's a chef owner in the boat and 
they you cook for us wow and he will and then the  
tour guide will take us to the island okay around 
yeah so then we finish the day around 4 P.M back  
in hotel that sounds cool to you yeah sounds 
good sounds good to you guys yeah that's good  
then I actually attacked him now yeah let's do it 
that uh pick us up at seven o'clock in the hotel  
uh on his van and take us to the market and 
go shopping yeah sounds good it's gonna be  
a fun day tomorrow yeah it sounds like it so 
it's gonna be a full-on full fully packed uh  
boat trip tomorrow so uh we're gonna be like 
so burnt the whole day Under the Sun yeah it's  
gonna be complete Sunburn and these two they're 
actually doing another boat till after Quran from  
Coronado it's got [ __ ] called a top Expedition 
I'm sure you guys have heard about it before but  
I think they're gonna do it themselves and we'll 
meet them back in El Nido after a while so it's  
gonna be a lot of road trip boat trip for the two 
of them yeah I hope I don't get any seasick and  
hopefully it's not too choppy all right see you 
guys at dinner all right see you later all right  
so now it's around sunset time so it's time to uh 
grab dinner so apparently just then on this side  
there is a uh there's a coron town the main town 
with lots of food options we missed that just then  
we didn't see it but apparently there is a huge 
variety of options like Korean barbecue and even  
so maybe we can get that later yeah but anyway 
this is my father I'm hungry yeah it's okay  
didn't you just eat a lot I thought you ate 
like a three portions of seafood just now yeah  
yeah tell you the cheaper platter that 
we had was full of miniature craft and  
miniature together oh so it's also it's mini 
size yeah uh crap even the crap because I  
didn't get much of the crap at all right what's 
this size only oh no okay yeah right how much  
did you pay for the craft uh was it worth it 
how much did we pay eight for your 800 pesos
the car was one of a doggy oh excuse me yeah
yeah I think the park is about 800 pesos 800 pesos 
yeah obviously we did not paying enough to get the  
diesel yeah I think it's rather tourist areas here 
so from what we observed just and everything was  
quite quite a lot yeah compared to other places 
yeah I think for motorbikes usually it's uh for  
a whole day it should be around 300 400 pesos 
when we're in Cebu we saw that price but here  
it's 300 pesos for one hour one to four hour okay 
yeah so and then the whole day is around like
[Music]
wow that's so good yeah wow so good price
you can pay more than 15 pesos about 15 
pesos so good it's a good price anyway  
this is my brother Jason yeah he flew all the 
way in from Melbourne and uh he uh took a red  
eye flight is that mean it's a last night 
he didn't sleep much so he's definitely  
three hours I think he was in Singapore 
last night ah do you go to Hawker Center
uh what do you guys think do we look alike
and uh what do you think of his accent is it a 
very Australian I don't know you tell me I think  
so I think the the real test is when you talk to 
Alina if she understands it means it's Australian
blue all the way in from Melbourne and my father 
flew from Hong Kong so my family is all around  
you're well respect it looks exactly the same 
like a brother yeah my father looks really young
to finding my neck just have a 
good metabolism family so skinny  
okay everyone so young yeah my 
father looks so uh so so young
welcome to Asia how's your impression of Quran 
so far [Music] your first time seeing tricycles
during my previous trip oh yeah and I think this 
trip will actually get to try try to try to ride  
on them yeah that could be cool because the last 
time we went here was actually in Cebu it's our  
our whole family second time right together 
in the Philippines welcome to the family
yeah the new member new baby yeah
yeah we walked down I think we walk up 
to here just then and we just gave up  
yeah are you so look at me this will be 30 
years of him later 30 years 30 years yeah
yeah
I think in the comments people will say 
you're very young maybe you look like  
Max like 30 h40 Max Steel 40 maybe 
50 feet away he's actually 29 guys  
we are Brothers Three Brothers yeah 
it looks like it and a little sister
yeah I think uh in in the Philippines the one 
thing you can try later maybe it's coconut  
they call it Buco here which 
means young coconut okay buco  
yeah yeah it's like a smoke opener but they said 
mostly and drinking here so hectic as uh as a  
night just now huh no we actually didn't come 
that far I think there's a lot of tourist stuff
oh oh wait no we did oh look at that speaker yeah
we're going so fast wait copyright copyright
I'll walk like this the film is so fast yeah  
I think that's a impression of most foreigners 
when I first came to the Philippines it's the fact  
that they need to cover the nose because you guys 
may not know what to say in the Philippines and  
um because they're just lots of Vehicles like 
tricycles and motorbikes and everywhere we  
feel here so fresh that's true yeah after 
living in Manila this cannot be compared
yeah we just got some fruits here we got like 
two oranges and two mangoes did you try for  
190 190 okay so oh two orange two mangoes that's 
good yeah I think it's okay yeah it's okay yeah  
oh so I was dying for some advisements here 
how was uh how was the fruits here uh more or  
less the same well we've only had one meal hmm 
what's up it was good yeah I know a bit small  
yeah I don't know if Corona Oneida is famous for 
seafood but if we had a chance I think tomorrow  
we're gonna go on a boat trip we got a decision 
to make so are we doing Korea tonight or are  
we doing Spanish I think let's do Spanish maybe 
okay yeah change my mind let's do Spanish today  
just because my stomach has been having some 
issue with meat Spanish rice will be nice
oh yeah we walked past this just now 
but we uh walked away goodbye [Music]  
I think there is not a lot of Spanish 
options inside for what we saw this then yeah  
yeah I had a look on Google yeah it doesn't 
look very Spanish it doesn't look very Spanish
thank you now you understand when I first 
came to Philippines why focused so much
yeah Chicken manok on the side of the road 
hello hello oh yeah that's pork belly yeah  
it's called liambo I think so we see liamfo 
olympo yeah and this is chicken okay manuk  
and you see them grilling this is my memory in 
Cebu uh yeah the only thing I remember it's like  
a chicken rolling on the South Street 
and my mouth is watering already yeah  
so good it's okay plenty of chances 
we can eat this later I think we can  
just one night buy chicken and 
then come back and eat nightmare
I think it'll be good idea come back here why 
is this woman holding a spoon because I want to  
teach you Asian Asian weapon and and uh Asian 
weapon yeah I see you guys three three of you  
guys reactions like put chicken like like this 
like this like a dog in the street yeah exactly  
now you know it runs in the family we love 
chicken yeah wow I feel like I haven't uh I  
was thinking we might go out there wait okay oh
