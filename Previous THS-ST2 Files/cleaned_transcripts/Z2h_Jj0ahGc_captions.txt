Hey everybody, it is Dave coming to 
you from Los Angeles, Ontario airport
so this is a very exciting day for 
me because it is the day that I  
secretly am flying to Manila to surprise my 
Filipina girlfriend in time for her birthday
so my girlfriend Abby thinks that I will be coming  
to Manila next week and she's all 
excited to meet me at the airport
but I'm going to have to let her 
down a little bit and come a bit  
early and surprise her and catch her reaction
I don't think she'll mind I think she'll 
be very happy actually, let's hope
so Abby my girlfriend and I have not seen 
each other in person for about 1 year now 
and we've been long distance for that long
just been video chatting a lot 
so yeah we're both very 
ready to see each other again
she keeps telling me how excited she is and that 
that she wished I was coming earlier than I was
so yeah this will be her birthday present to 
be like yeah you got your wish, I came early
all right but uh yeah enough chatting to 
the camera right now, let's do the thing
so I actually started today's 
journey at the Seattle Airport  
and I was going to start my vlog there but 
it it kind of got crazy there for a minute
so I decided to start it here in this airport,  
Los Angeles Ontario where it's uh 
much quieter and uh much less busy
which brings me to say I really appreciate 
international flights to Asia now flying  
out of LA Ontario because I like this 
airport a whole lot better than I like LAX
so because this is such a long journey I think 
it's going to be 20 plus hours 20 to 25 hours  
I don't even know it I'm just trying not 
to think about how long it's going to be
but because this is going to be 
such a long flight day I had to  
come up with an excuse for Abby 
to be out of cell phone range
so what I told her is that me and 
my friend George were going camping  
off grid and that I wouldn't be able 
to contact her for the next 24 hours
so she shouldn't be expecting any 
messages from me while I am in the air
somehow I made a rookie mistake 
and ended up in the middle seat
this is going to be a really long flight
for you, Abby
all right so here I am in the final 
transfer point for my flight to Manila
this is the Taipei international 
airport, it's a really nice one
but it is humid in here I 
can't do a thing with my hair
and I wish it was easier to get from point to  
point because this is a very 
long terminal to walk down
anyway so I have a couple hours layover, why 
don't I tell you about how Abby and I met
so, as I said before, it was last 
year and I was working for a tech  
startup that wanted to open up an office in Manila
and they chose me to manage that project and sent 
me to Manila, so I lived there for about 5 months
and in the meantime I joined 
a gym and Abby also happened  
to be a member of that gym, so that is how we met
Abby saw me first at the gym. 
I was on the treadmill and she  
thought I was really fast, 
so she nicknamed me Flash
that's how we met
she might have a slightly different story about it  
but maybe I'll let her tell her 
side of that once I get there
so after we met at the gym we just started 
dating, saw each other a couple times a week
you know we were both working we'd 
meet up in the evenings and weekends,  
so yeah it just grew from there
it turned into a purely long-distance relationship 
because I had to fly back to the States to do  
other work and it's been about a year since 
we've seen each other, so it is about time
all right let's hop on the flight to Manila
all right, finally. after so many hours of travel, 
I lost count, I made it to Manila. Merry Christmas
so next plan of action is to get to my hotel
oh my gosh, I am so happy to finally be in 
my hotel room, I cannot wait to take a shower
but first let's go over the game plan
it has just turned afternoon here in Manila I 
will not be surprising Abby until this evening
and the reason for that is because 
she has an exam coming up later  
this afternoon that if she passes will 
hopefully advance her career a little bit
so instead of surprising her before hand and 
making her mind go everywhere I want her to  
focus on that first and then surprise 
her and hopefully make her really happy
so I've got some time to shower 
and rest a little bit and *sniff* 
whew, make myself smell better
all right, the time is approaching 
to go surprise my girlfriend Abby
so I decided to go with the shirt that Abby 
gave me for my birthday she says it would do  
well in the Philippines because it's nice and 
cooling, and so far I'm in agreement with her
one thing I'll do when I approach the place is  
wear this hat to try to cover my 
face because they do have CCTV.
if she decides to look at the CCTV before opening  
the door uh that might ruin the 
surprise a little bit so yeah
and to finish it off by smelling good 
I'm going to wear this cologne by Versace
this is Abby's favorite to smell 
on me, she absolutely loves it
all right, let's go surprise the girlfriend
so what I told Abby is that I am getting 
a gift delivered to her at at her home,  
so this is what she's expecting,
she's not expecting me though
all right, the Grab just dropped me off and I'm 
at her place and I'm going to go knock, here we go
she's expecting a knock so there's that
Hello mum sir, delivery
she's coming she's coming
hi *gasp*
happy birthday.
*speechless*
