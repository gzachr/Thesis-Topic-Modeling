- Everyone, I've been
waiting for this episode.
So we are here in LA.
We are going to meet up with
Chef Charles of Ma'am Sir.
Interesting fact, his
first Filipino pop-up,
was my first Filipino pop-up.
That dinner was my first time experiencing
Filipino food in a new way.
I think it kind of eventually
lead to this show.
Maybe, I don't know.
So I think that LA has the most exciting
Filipino food scene in the U.S.
And Chef Charles played
a huge role in that.
- [Francesca] What are we cooking today?
- We're cooking a couple of things.
Our longganisa burger and
our shrimp and uni lumpia.
- For a Filipino American,
like a longganisa burger?
Hell yeah.
- Yes, in the Philippines
they have these chori burgers.
The ratio of chorizo to
mayonnaise is like fifty fifty.
- Whoa.
- And it's the best thing to eat
when your drunk on the beach.
I knew that this would
be the perfect venue,
to put that burger in.
The longganisa in the
Philippines is a cured sausage.
Salt, sugar, pepper.
With mine I put garlic,
and the color is red.
It's a mixcure of annatto and beets.
So it gives you this reddish color.
- Hmm.
- For the chopped up garlic we
blanche it a couple of times.
- [Francesca] And what's
the point of that?
- [Charles] We're just
trying to get that beautiful,
slightly pungent flavor of the garlic.
That flavors the whole thing.
You want to mix it yourself?
(sighs)
All you need to remember
is go one direction.
Yeah, just mix it all together.
And once it's mixed you
just go one direction.
- Okay, so like this?
- Yes, you really want to mix it, mix it.
And that's how you get a nice
elasticity to this patty.
Since you were going this
way, I'm going to go this way.
So this is my direction, okay?
I just want to show you the
agitation that you need to do.
So this is it, we're
going to let this cure
for about two days.
And I have something ready.
A five ounce scoop.
This is a very high in sugar patty.
- Diabetes runs in my family.
(both laughing)
I can't keep doing this
show for that much longer.
What kind of buns do you use?
- [Charles] King's Hawaiian.
- [Francesca] Yeah.
- [Charles] This is garlic aioli.
The biggest thing is like a big heap.
- [Francesca] Oh my god.
- Of this achara
- [Charles] Achara is a vegetable pickle.
Primarily shredded papaya.
It's kind of like our
version of sauerkraut.
Germans have sauerkraut, we have achara.
- Wow.
Take that Prime Time.
- [Charles] Cheers.
- [Francesca] Cheers.
That's what's up.
Oh my god, it's so good.
This is really well balanced.
So is this LA food or Filipino food?
- At this point it's LA food.
The true core of what we're
making is Filipino but
it's influenced by what's around us.
The great burger culture of In-N-Out,
the great produce of the market,
farms of central California.
I'm Filipino, I grew up there.
But I can't speak for the country.
Like you can't go there
and have this food.
Especially this, this
is here, it's not there.
Filipinos specifically are so
connected to their childhood
growing up that if it
doesn't taste like that,
they are like "ugh".
- It sucks.
- And I understand.
- I think one great talking
point on that is your lumpia.
- Yoooo
- You put uni on top.
- So when it first opened
the name of our lumpia
was "lumpia Shanghai".
But then everyone was like
"This is not lumpia Shanghai."
People were getting
offended because again,
lumpia Shanghai is a connotation
of these little things
that you buy, by the hundreds
why is there uni here?
If I'm gonna to call something,
it has to be what it is.
So two weeks later we
changed the name to "lumpia".
I learned a lot from that.
From those two weeks.
- So can you show me
how to make your lumpia?
- Yes, of course.
Chef Derrick.
See, he's shy.
- I'm always the man behind the man.
- Wow.
- [Charles] Alright
Chef, we got two minutes.
- Two minutes?
Hey Siri, set two minute timer.
Okay so this is the lumpia.
Peeled and de-veined shrimp.
Some of the liquids,
fresh squeezed kalamansi, cherry vinegar,
a little bit of sesame
oil, dark soy sauce.
I'm gonna finish that with
sugar, salt, and black pepper.
And for us it's always
the shrimp uni mousse.
It's just gonna be a
little bit of egg white
and that's what is gonna give
us the mousse, the volume.
Just to keep it very very light.
- All them titos watching us
are like, "shrimp mousse?"
- [Derrick] Lardo, so it's cured pork fat.
And some green onions.
We finish it with uni.
- [Charles] One of the
things we use all the time,
that's very abundant here is uni.
In the Philippines we have sea urchin
but it's never this beautiful.
This is the other thing
that's not very traditional.
In plain sight it looks
like lumpia wrapper, right?
- Yeah.
- But it's actually feuilles de brick,
it's North African French.
Feels very much like the lumpia-
- [Francesca] Like a lumpia.
- [Charles] Like a popiah wrapper.
It's more porus, lighter,
it feels more luxurious.
The secret to a lumpia is
actually the multiple layers
of wrapper you have before
you get to the filling.
You just put a small amount,
and it's the layer,
after layer, after layer.
After that we freeze it.
It just helps it set a little bit,
and fry a little bit better.
So we fry this at three-fifty for about
two and a half minutes.
- [Francesca] Wow.
- [Charles] Just a little bit of chives,
just a little bit of freshness.
And then they get a little bit of vinegar.
- Of course they do.
- So this is our lumpia,
on top garnished with fresh
sea urchin from Santa Barba.
Fresh wedge of lime
and some spicy vinegar.
And then dip it now.
- Yes sir.
Oh my god.
- So we do it like that so people will see
the importance of acid in our food.
Because it's good as it is but
with the vinegar on that bite
with all those components takes it all
to a different level.
You kind of go in ebbs and
flows on one plate.
It's like a symphony,
it has to be a symphony.
It's not just your putting
it because your mom made it.
- That was awesome.
That was a great experience.
Within that ten seconds,
those two bites, mind blowing.
My first experience eating
Filipino food like this
was at your first pop-up.
It was really cool, plated beautifully.
I was like, "what the hell".
I was growing up, never
having eaten it that way.
I can kind of like, myself
went through a process
of "oh this is what
Filipino food could be".
- It could be possible.
- [Francesca] What I love about LA,
it has the largest Filipino
population in the U.S
The spectrum of Filipino
restaurants is so cool
because you have a
little bit of everything.
You have the mom and pop,
like turo turo style.
You have chains like Max's
and then you have your
restaurant which is just like
a different take on Filipino food.
There's not other city that
compares to that, in the U.S.
- [Charles] There's
something for everyone.
- [Francesca] Yeah.
- [Charles] My perspective
as restaurateur,
is not to put up a museum.
Because oftentimes when
people go to Filipino
restaurants they expect artifacts.
They expect history.
They expect what they had growing up.
We curate things for your experience.
So we are not museums, we
are not artifact keepers.
If we just do another restaurant,
what we all grew up eating,
then how does that improve us?
Every culture is accommodating.
Every culture is loving.
So what makes us unique?
It's everybody working here.
We just want to accept
people, take care of people,
and nourish people, everyday.
Putting forth that Filipino spirit.
