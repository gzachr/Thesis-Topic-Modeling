Welcome to the Philippines.
We're visiting an orphanage in the Philippines
and we're bring you along to show you something culturally different
and interesting.
Well, hello there.
These kids can be quite friendly.
This is where they keep the really young kids
and I think we should let them get back to sleep.
Hello.
And here, we're visiting some of the kids that are a little bit older.

Travis
What's your name?
Eugene
What's your name?
They're all quite friendly and welcoming.

We're having a little presentation
for the kids.
Mother cautioned Little Red Riding Hood
not to stop by the road and talk to strangers.
He's having me read his book to him.
Bye bye

at this orphanage.
