need to get out of this area i don't know 
what's going on there's no way in london  
as nice as this it's just 
a really nice chilled area
good morning everyone welcome back to manila 
today is our first full day here in the city  
we did have sneak peek yesterday so we are 
super excited today to check out what other  
things manila has to offer we've got a few 
stocks planned so if you are new around  
here please hit subscribe we really appreciate 
that so let's head to our first stop of the day
this many skyscrapers in manila the 
high rise building skylight like the  
skyline here is insane it literally 
stretches from all the way like here
all the way across to there 
and there's loads behind  
us i just didn't think it was like i 
knew there was going to be high rises but  
not to the scale that there is 
definitely surprised about that  
this could be the summer okay so we've made 
it towards the bgc area which is bon peachell  
from facio global city and it's definitely 
the porsche area i guess of manila which we  
already kind of knew i think yeah massive really 
modern high-rise buildings everywhere seems to be  
very wealthy we've seen a lot of 
expensive cars driving around two of them  
expensive cars big houses big skyscrapers 
lots of security everywhere um yeah definitely  
a fancier bit we've just come out of the american 
cemetery and memorial uh unfortunately you're not  
allowed to film in there which is a bit cut in 
because it would be cool to show just how big  
that place actually is so there's 17 000 graves of 
americans that were killed here during world war  
ii and there's also 36 000 names of people 
that were missing during the world war ii  
so you can just imagine how big the ground must 
be to have that many graves i thought it would  
be like a little bit eerie which is what you'd 
i guess presume the cemetery to be like but it  
was actually really peaceful like all the graves 
they're all they're all just white white crosses  
and they're all in like big lines and it was so 
quiet in there you could just see the birds tubing  
i think the only thing i can compare it to is the 
white crosses that you see in the washington dc  
um sort of area where they have the same sort of 
thing i guess we were discussing on the way to the  
memorial that it just doesn't feel like we're in 
manila at the moment so yeah the the difference in  
the area so you've got the passe area then you've 
got the mccarthy area and we walk through to get  
you which we are going to go back to and then this 
area here the bgc area it just seems like another  
another city yeah it does it's like as soon as 
you as soon as you pass the beach you see that i
yeah like everything seems to be 
maintained perfectly here like oh yeah  
there's no there's no cracks in the 
slabs on the pavement the grass is  
all cut nicely there's no rubbish anywhere 
it's literally like kept so well oh yeah  
i've said this once or maybe 
a couple of times today but i  
can't believe how more done this place actually is  
so we've made it to the fornication as i 
say thank you bona france your high street  
it's really really cool you've 
got like this outdoor area  
in the middle and then you've just got shops 
either side it's really cool it's awesome  
there's definitely an american influence 
here there's a tgi fridays we've passed a  
few american shops already there seems to be 
another like shopping mall in there as well  
they just love shopping don't they yeah it is 
i think it is known as like the shopping city  
like i don't know pgc in general or if it's 
just like manila almost it's just known for  
its shopping yeah i think it must be vanilla 
because there's just so many shops here yeah  
um so many shopping malls 
as well they're everywhere  
but yeah this is a really really nice area 
it's lovely it's really relaxed as well  
first impressions it's really nice here 
bgc is a really nice a nice area it is
i think if you say anywhere that i'd want 
to live in manila it would probably be  
the vgc area what do think agree 
it's a really really nice yeah you
area and i think it's got a bit of everything  
so you've got like the green space and then 
you've got the shops and the restaurants  
obviously we don't know how much it is to actually 
live here i'd imagine it would be quite expensive  
just from locking around and like walking around 
the area we are gonna leave this area yeah
stay here stay here forever we're gonna 
leave this area we're gonna head back to  
mccarty and check that out because we didn't 
really see much of it yesterday so i guess  
no this would be our proper first 
impressions of it yeah we've got a night  
hopefully it's all fun i think it is uh a 
nice little lunch stuff i've just spotted what
there seems to be such an american influence 
here there's so many americans there was also  
dunkin donuts yesterday what was that yeah 
in the shopping mall yeah yeah we caved it  
happened we got the crispy crabs the people 
are so friendly here i know you're so nice  
as soon as we walked in he was like good morning 
sir good morning ma'am okay how can i help how are  
you today i think i've known to start yesterday as 
well seems to be a very big thing about um helping  
like service yeah like we were in the supermarket 
and people were like packing the bags for us  
and we only had a couple of things um so 
yeah like i don't know if that's just like  
the retail industry and the hospitality 
industry sort of doing it i would say  
that but then even like the security guards 
and things with perhaps just walking on the  
street they're like come on in so yeah people 
are just really friendly yeah they're lovely  
okay we were just discussing now 
there is nowhere we can compare to  
city-wise which is as nice as this like there's 
nowhere in london as nice as this area nowhere  
near i haven't been to new york so i can't 
really go back but i haven't seen anywhere  
as nice as this in any city or any country that 
i've been to in terms of like a city they've done  
it both so well so you've got the green space 
and then you've got the big high-rise buildings  
and they just put it together and it works 
so well and they've kept it clean there's  
high security here there's no rubbish there's 
the grass is well maintained they've got these  
really nice palm trees and there's bins everywhere 
there's it's just everything's like everything's  
spot on yes yeah right we need to get out of 
this area because we'll never leave otherwise  
so we're gonna head to mccarthy 
check up there get some lunch i think
we've seen this jollibee everywhere um let us know 
if we should try it i think it's like a big thing  
isn't it yeah i think i've seen a lot of people 
like having it online and things so is it like  
their version of maybe like a mcdonald's maybe i 
don't know i've seen this sounds like spaghetti  
or something yeah which is strange that they saw 
spaghetti in a fast food restaurant but i mean  
it was worth trying let us know 
down below and let us know i guess  
what to try in jollibee yeah i think we'll 
definitely try it but let us know what to get
we just went to the mccarthy area now it has got 
similar vibes to the bgc but not as maybe like  
high end so we are heading to what looks like 
a little like outdoor food store market kind  
of thing yeah they've got like the palm trees in 
the middle of the roads and they've got like the  
skyscraper buildings here so it's definitely a 
nice area especially the spot that we're in now  
greenbelt is where we were yesterday 
and i think we're just heading this
way right the market that we were going to go 
to is not open until 5 p.m and we can't wait  
that long it's about half one now i think so we 
decided to pick up some chicken from like a hole  
in the wall 24 chicken no idea if it's popular or 
not but there was a few people there where we went  
but it was just cool it was just pouring the water 
so yeah we're just going to eat these on the way  
and head to our next stop so we'll pick it up 
where we get there guys we have made it through  
the next stop of the day this is manila bay walk 
now a little bay walk is probably more famous for  
the mall of asia which is just down that way but 
we're gonna be heading this way into old town so  
the bay walk is actually quite long i'll just show 
you now it goes stretches all the way up here and  
the mall is down this way the big mall 
which we're gonna check out tomorrow  
but for today it's a long walk down here so we're 
going to chill out for baby yeah the sun is just  
coming too it hasn't really been out today and 
then we're going to head to the old town the hotel  
looks really cool totally different vibes i guess 
to what we've seen yeah what we've seen so far
and i'll show what's going on here but they've 
got loads of sand and it looks like they're  
shipping it in from the ship they might be 
making like maybe like a man-made beach i  
don't know that's my guess is that a new thing 
or is that an old thing that they're redoing  
i don't know they're pretty cool but 
there's a beach in manila that's pretty sick
we're just coming into the intramurals now 
we just read a sign that says it dates back  
to the 1500s this area and there's a lot 
of spanish influence so i think we'll be  
able to see that in the buildings they 
might look a bit european a bit yeah um  
yeah we're gonna walk down here check it 
out there's supposed to be a couple of like  
landmarks to check out the area 
so let's see what we come across
guys we've come to the main basilica in the 
old town and there's definitely like a european  
especially like a spanish portuguese sort 
of like a lisbon um seville feel i guess to  
this neighborhood here you could tell by 
the buildings and obviously the basilica  
we've got a statue of king charles iv which 
is the king of spain or was the king of spain  
um and yeah it's just a really nice chilled 
area totally different to any of the other  
neighborhoods it's it's mad the the sort 
of difference between the bgc area the  
mccarty area the passe area the and then the 
instrument what's it called the instruments
the intramurals area yeah but yeah  
super cool to check out all the different 
areas in one day it just makes you feel like  
you're just moving into different cities i guess 
rather than just being in different neighborhoods  
the bay we've already seen is like lisbon but 
this street reminds me of antalya and turkey with  
the cobbled streets and you've got the balconies 
it just really reminds me of europe as you said
we've come down to the last stop of our day today 
before we head back and it's called rizzo park  
now the reason we've come here is one is a 
nice green space area here near the uh bay  
but they also have a fountain water show 
every day at r5 i'm really excited fantasy  
lights and music and what's 
going on it's free free chat
and on that note i think we're going to end 
it here that's our first date in manila over  
really really impressive manila 
uh i think we've had a really fun  
jam-packed full day if you're new around you  
please hit subscribe give us thumbs up if you 
enjoyed it we'll see you again in the next one you
