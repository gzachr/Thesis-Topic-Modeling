hi
guys welcome back to my channel today
we're gonna cook lunch a filipino dish
uh this is a stir-fried sitau or
stir-fried
uh long-yard beans or others call it
snake beans
this is very good we filipinos love this
um
just put any kinds of meat what you want
seafoods will do also
i really love this food especially if
it's so fresh the vegetable is so fresh
and fortunately i only have frozen ones
but anyway it's still going to be tasty
and hopefully happy
we'll still like it so but first you
have to watch how i plant these
vegetables from start to finish
so watch it guys life of the acital and
then
i will cook the food later okay i'm
gonna get it from the
um brother-in-law's freezer because
i don't have enough space last summer on
my fridge
so i put most of the frozen vegetables
at my brother's fridge
i'm gonna cook lunch for a hubby
[Music]
so
[Music]
so
oh
okay
[Music]
hi guys good morning i am here at the
garden
i'm gonna put hay
on my sitau or snake beans
because summer is very hot
and i don't want them to be watered
every day because it's a bit far this
garden from us
so that's why i'm going to be putting
hay in order to contain the
wetness of the soil
luckily we have hay also so
some people are putting plastics and
other are using papers but
others also are using hay so i'm going
to use hay
to do like this under the plants
and at the same time the grass also will
not grow
this is a nice way to cover it
so that the
liquid or the water will not above it
easily
you have to put the hay
all right i just harvested few of them
like maybe four or three this one
because some of them are really that
young and
even this one are still young maybe it
needs two more days
this one and then but this is good
enough for my pack bit
this one
just to help them out help them out
like that this one sun
and i need to tie in like this
so that it will not reach the ground
because
i just want to help them like that
like so until they mature
clock
