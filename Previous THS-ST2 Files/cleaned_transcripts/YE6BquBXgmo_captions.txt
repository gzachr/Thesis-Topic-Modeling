hello beautiful people we have a 
private boat trip booked for tomorrow  
where we're going to show you the paradise of 
el nido from the sky the sea and below the sea  
and we've also accepted a challenge from 
one of our subscribers called champ champ  
who's challenged us to try the loot for 
the very first time who's it going to be me  
pornelli thanks champ but first things first 
we are going to take you to the local market  
and walk the streets of united town proper and 
yes it's called a town proper oh my god this is so  
heavy can you please have one of these i see 
these cracklings by the fruit stands and i'm  
so curious to find out what they are what a 
lovely lady she said it's a cassava cracker  
and they fry it but she couldn't explain very 
well in english how exactly do they make it
it's very crispy and sweet  
we came to the local market for the view and 
the vibes everything seems to be dancing to  
a soundtrack here loving it there's so many 
friendly vendors here selling fascinating work  
and one of them has just called me to 
show me what he has he has a huge squid
what a great little market i love markets for 
me they're the place where you can get a real  
view of the location we're gonna head into town 
now you can get a tricycle for like 50 pesos  
but we're gonna take a walk so we don't 
miss out on these little market stores  
there's some cool merch you can find here from 
flip-flops and t-shirts to magnets for your fridge
i've just lifted my hands and i saw 
that i have some sort of a reaction  
to the jackfruit i don't have 
any allergies or intolerances  
but i'm sure this will go soon a 
bit of salt water and you'll be fine  
after a short 10 minute walk we arrived 
downtown united has this cozy charm  
that's preserved by the locals and it 
feels like time has stopped years ago
this place smells like home it's one of the places 
in town known for the view and the mediterranean  
cuisine they also have happy hour now that is 
a restaurant with a view wow that's a cool hat  
makes me dream of our vietnam trip let me know 
if it looks good on me staying in town proper is  
a good option for you if you want everything in 
one place there's small booty hostels and great  
luxury hotels and the food in here is so amazing 
in the world but we're gonna talk food later  
but first i want to grab a beer we've been looking 
at this place as we walk past it's a ukrainian  
nano brewery they do craft fair ipa you're thirsty 
apologies for the loud music but at least you  
get to feel the cool vibes in here it's such a 
unique place we're going to show you around in  
a minute but they have some cool craft beer it's 
brewed for the tropical climates but some of them  
are just like beer cocktail with brownie this is 
insane i'm not sure if i'm gonna go for that one  
but i'm definitely gonna try some cool craft 
beer i've gone for the sunny wheat it's bright  
and fresh and it's good nice hoppy days guys if 
you like craft beer this is the place to come  
but now it's time to eat just walk along the side 
streets and you find spicy indian japanese sushi  
artisan gelato and good old filipino specialities 
there's booty cresturans right next to the humble  
hole in the woody there's all sorts of food to 
sweeten your mood here now this place is known to  
be the best pizza place in united they serve brick 
oven pizzas and one of the top flavors here is  
bacon truffle hope it's available my god 
that is absolutely delicious craft beer  
and truffle all in the same night wow i think 
that's probably the best 1200 pesos we spent  
so far i walked past this gelato place on the 
way to the pizza restaurant i thought i'd get  
one afterwards but i just don't want to take 
the taste of that pizza right whoa there might  
be something that might destroy it oh yeah okay 
cham-cham it's pollute time but who's gonna do it
yeah of course it's going to be me let's do it  
these corners for the brave souls if you're 
looking for authentic fear [ __ ] the street  
food you've got to come find this balloon stand 
for those of you who don't know balut is a boiled  
fertilized duck egg this one is 16 days old am

yolk i did try the yellow part first  
okay this is okay i need to add more 
salt it's it's time to try the chick now
to my surprise this is actually tasty 
the challenge is never complete if i  
don't finish it i have to finish it oh 
something a bit crunchy we just have the  
white part left now this is very hard almost 
like a dry bubble gum this kind of texture
that was quite of an experience and if you 
ask me if i'm going to eat balloon again  
i would say 50 50. i did like 50 of it but the 
white part was a little bit too hard for me it's  
been a long day today guys we are gonna grab one 
of these cute little tricycles it's only 50 pesos  
home and we're gonna see in the morning 
hello what's up filipinos welcome to el nido
today is gonna be a very special day we've 
just met dennis he's our tour guide today  
and he's taking us to paradise there's so 
many boats leaving today i don't know he's  
even going to get this boat out he's kind of 
just pushing boats out of the way and moving  
strings to try and get there i'm so glad 
we decided to go for a private boat today
oh
i haven't done this for a while let's 
see if we still got it still got it
the second stop is big lagoon 
and i i'm so looking forward to  
see it it's inside the rocks so we're gonna have 
to rent kayaks it's 350 pesos for all four of us  
and we're gonna go kayak inside the 
water is so clear we're just going  
through this first page when it opens up into 
the bigger bit i can just see the bigger bit  
now and you can also see where the water 
changes color where it finally goes deep
it's just beautiful so beautiful i'm 
gonna say that a lot today i'm sorry  
we're just entering the mangroves and 
if you have watched our videos you  
know that we love mangroves and you 
know the story about the mangroves
okay
we just arrived the chimney so we have our 
own little private beach and they're going  
to set up lunch on the beach we have lunch 
included in the boat race and the best part  
of it is being cooked on board look at this 
piece it was enjoying nature this morning
we have our lunch we have 
some mussels pros we have  
fresh fish we have a salad from 
cucumbers and a virgin and some chicken  
i'm looking forward to this one right on 
the beach but the best part about it is  
that there's local boats men pulling up with 
cases full of cold beer how are you gonna be
okay this is our fourth stop now i mean 
the lagoon was incredible as you know  
great lunch by the way but probably this 
is gonna be my favorite spot because as you  
know by now with me i prefer life under the 
water snorkelling time let's go underwater
so that was our fourth stop like i said we're now 
going to head off to i think it was our last stop  
which is the secret lagoon i guess 
that means i can't see where it is  
okay guys i'm going to attempt my first 
ever backflip this should be fun to watch  
everyone's watching me now a little bit nervous
balance
hey guys i'm not sure if you could hear me um 
it's a bit noisy here but we're just about to swim  
underneath what i'm underneath the limestone to 
go into another lagoon which is the secret lagoon  
let's feel the queue so try and get here when 
it's quiet this place is absolutely breathtaking
thank you for being with us on board and join 
us in the next one as we get to explore quran
