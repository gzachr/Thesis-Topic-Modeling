Hello to you Rafał Baran from SzukającPrzygody.pl
and I invite you to another quarantine report in Dumaguete, Philippines
today is Tuesday April 28
and I have the opportunity to record a new episode for you
because it has changed a bit in Dumaguete when it comes to quarantine
passes and other things, as you can see, I am still here
on our terrace above
but in a moment as soon as I finish things in the garden
I'm taking you to the mountains with you somewhere
show you some views, something different, drive a bit around the city
because finally I have my desire
my longed-for pass
this pass authorizes me to leave today
on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays, between
7am and 6pm, it's not like that anymore
I have to queue to get a pass for a specific day
now these passes, one such pass
was spent on the whole apartment
or me, Christine, Emilia
aunt, her brother we have one pass
for the whole family
and we have to use it
these passes will most likely be valid until
April 30, so
in fact for the next two days
they were valid for the last week, but I didn't record it before because it didn't make sense
really
from what I know today, after April 30
the situation in Dumaguete is getting a little loose
namely Dumaguete remained
classified as a place where
low-risk place when it comes to Coronavirus
it is due to the fact that it is not present
active cases throughout
Negros Oriental
they still do tests every day, send them to Cebu
and these tests are coming back negative
the point is that throughout Dumaguete, Negros Oriental
there were only 4 cases of the virus crown from what
the media report, at least the ones in Dumaguete
two people died, one person
I don't know what happened to her at all
not at all
it wasn't said what happened to her
I think she was taken to Cebu and
one person has recovered
and as of today there are no other completely cases
that's why Dumaguete was classified as "low risk"
and most likely on April 30, as they promised, they will open
they will basically open everything in Dumaguete and you won't have to have passes
you'll be able to go shopping normally
I don't know if restaurants and bars will open
I know that tourism will definitely be blocked
for probably another month
but this is how it looks, I don't want to prolong it
well, but you would probably be interested as ever
the situation is in the Philippines, well
it is uninteresting only in a few places
which are classified as very dangerous, i.e. Manila, Cebu and
part of Davao, from what I know, which is basically the 3 largest cities
in the Philippines, because basically there
only these cases grow elsewhere
they grow, but very, very slowly or not at all
so we hope they finally unlock all of this on the 30th
and we will be able to go somewhere with Emilia
and now I invite you to the rest
section
 
 
okay, i managed to escape
I'm on a pass, I went to the areas of Valencia
I am exactly on the west side now
Valencia, the city
I'm about 2 or 3 kilometers away
but as you saw in the earlier video
it's basically all the time from my home
towards the mountains and I arrive to such a quiet place
I like this place
it's so climatic
over the bridge you just crossed
there is a nice river, the views are even cool
but there is silence and this is the most important thing, it is far from this city
about 8 kilometers
so as soon as I have free time I try to come here
we also usually go with Emilia and Christine every week
or even twice a week in the areas of this Valencia
but now all restaurants and such places
tourist are closed, so we don't even have much where to go
and you still need passes, unfortunately
to leave the house, so we can't do the two or the three of us
get out together, for that matter,
Valencia is the place where
lives a lot of expats
why? because it's a mountain town
and here the temperature is always a few degrees lower
than in the city center
it is also much quieter, there is more greenery
and higher humidity, but not like that
in a negative sense, more in a positive sense
because of this humidity there is a lot of greenery here
and this is what foreigners like more
if they want to go shopping, then just eat down
towards Dumaguete and are already in a normal shopping center
ultimately I'm planning to move here sometime
buy a piece of land and build something
something your own or possibly rent
we will see everything as ours
plans will roll out
well, we live in the center today, so
I can only dream of it
I also wanted to record this episode for you more
quiet place, not like it's always on my terrace at the top
where are the dogs, renovations
and of course traffic
because I know it can just bore you
that's why I went here
because I also wanted to take a gentle break from all this
and also record something for you
also tell about the future of the channel
about the future of the blog, because a lot will change now
Today I also have a good opportunity to inform you about it
what will change on the blog
I have to tell you something, last month
there was a great craze on my blog
very, very many people sent me a private message
or email
asking for all kinds of businesses in the Philippines
for help in arranging a visa
or just such advice
already very specific when it comes to opening
your business here, it's not about spending the holidays
or any such simply questions
what's the weather, it's more about writing it down really
specific things already
I wrote very often
that I just don't have time for it, because writing such a one
a business plan for someone explaining everyone
especially the exact things he must do
step by step it is time consuming
and you have to understand it, on the other hand
I have the impression that some people do this
how to say it is a bit different
which shocked me, because if someone is writing to me
that he wants some concrete
an idea on how to earn in the Philippines
with what budget and where to give it exactly
I
I expect something in return
because this is my private time
which I can spend looking after my daughter either
just playing with her or even going silly shopping
and I spend this time explaining it to him
and he doesn't like it, that I expect something in return
so it scares me a little bit
I will be honest with you, I make a blog for you
 
and it gives me great pleasure that I can explain to you how
it all works in the Philippines
but if there are people who, despite the fact that I record these videos
writes articles in which
everything is very matter-of-fact and specific
they still have trouble understanding some things
then at some point
I will have to demand some payment for it
 
I don't want it to work that way either
Of course, the blog is for those who pay
because it will never be, I mean more that I have to
finally do something like that
my time that I spend and explain to people who
want to make money or save this money here in the Philippines
I have to somehow translate to my private time
which I just don't have at the moment
so either I'm sitting on IT projects
or I'm sitting on projects that I just write for you
that's why
with heartache
listen, I'm at the stage of setting up
Patronite
but this Patronite is not that I expect
from you, from those people who are watching my support channel
because I do it, as I say, for FUN
it gives me great pleasure
I am able to help you
and that I help you
while there are people who need this help
much more
and this Patronite is addressed to them
if they want to be in some private group
where I throw a business idea
how to invest money in the Philippines or
I explain the situation, for example with
what is dangerous now and what is safe
then they must
invest something in it
and at this point I have to invest my time
it seems to me that such a Patronite addressed to these people
who will benefit from it anyway
is the perfect solution
I don't direct it to the ordinary
say viewers or readers of this channel
because it's just for you
for free and I like to share with you
this knowledge, I like to share our private life with you
or just talking about what's going on in the Philippines
well what it looks like here, but it is directed at those
people who actually
think specifically about the Philippines
and I hope you don't get it wrong
this Patronite and this money
which I can possibly collect some
only and exclusively will contribute to the fact that the channel will develop
and I already have some plans for the future
namely as you probably see at this moment
I only record myself
but if there is any influence on this Patronite
even say 500 zlotys
in total monthly
then I will be able to spend this money for some Filipino
who will have a monthly payment
will have extra food from me
and his task will be
to ride with me
and just record, help me record
all these episodes or sometimes sometimes
explain if I can't get along, that is, I will
able to get to other interesting places
I will be able to give you more
You will record these episodes, because it will simply go faster
but most importantly this Filipino will have a job
and not just work, because I will try to take such a person
which has not been in contact with recording before
so he'll get some kind of work
I will teach him step by step how to operate the camera, how to record
what exactly to record, what elements interest me
even if he does it well
and he wants to continue learning, I don't see a problem,
to even show him how to assemble these materials
that he would find such a job for the future
using Adobe Premier Pro
and editing videos
Well, I've already rested for an hour
I listened to the sound of water
forest, or basically a jungle, because here the jungle is
not forest
and I have to go, I have to go now
grocery store, at the market
and do some shopping
I will go there with a camera, of course
so I hope I can get in there and see what it looks like
from the side of such a public market
there are the cheapest vegetables and fruits in Dumaguete
so I'll show you what I bought and for how much
see you in a moment
before I went to the market I wanted to draw your attention to you
for one small thing
we are in a place where people meet
and of course, as it happens in the Philippines
there is no trash can
and everything is scattered here
it is simply a massacre in Asia
as you can see bottles and even returnable
because those big bottles, those after Red Horsie
those after San Miguel are all returnable
it is 2, 5 or sometimes even 10 Pesos
they don't even want to pay it back and there is no money here
a grandmother would pass by
Five times a week through this area and she would already collect 100 Pesos
well, I can see here at least from 40 Pesos
and 40 Pesos is a pretty good meal
but as you can see, rubbish is just everywhere, there is little written about it
I will want to record a completely separate episode about it
what does it look like in the Philippines
because it's worth mentioning and teaching Filipinos
anyway, we used to do it
I don't know if it brought any results
but plastic is thundering here
ok let's go
TABO SA PAO is a small market near the airport in Dumaguete
by the local considered the cheapest and you probably will not find about it
information in no guide, this place is only visited by people who live
in the area
prices at this market deviate significantly from those offered
in supermarkets
for example, mango at the Robinson shopping center costs 260 Pesos per kilo
and here only 100
by buying at this market you support small farmers who cover long distances every day
to be able to sell in the city
Christine, she was preparing before leaving home
me a long list, which included such products as:
carrots, tomatoes, garlic, spinach, ginger, cucumbers
and even Ampalaya, which is very healthy by the way
of course, I found all these products here and came back
with full nets, the price I had to pay for it all
is 210 pesos, which translates more or less into
17 Polish zlotys
unfortunately, but I can't assess
is it a lot compared to Polish prices
I leave it to you
while looking at the Filipino realities, it really wasn't enough
I found something interesting at the market for the first time this year
I saw Dragon Fruit for sale at 250 Peso per kilo
I bought 2 pieces and I will try to record another episode for you
basically I finished my shopping and returned home on my scooter
Hey are you still there
I would like to inform you that on your left
the page you see the 2 most interesting videos from my channel
and below the SUBSCRIBE button if you liked this video
leave your thumbs up and remember that I'm recording
every few days, so see you in the next episode
