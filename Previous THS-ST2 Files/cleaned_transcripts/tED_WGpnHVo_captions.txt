Today, we're going to talk about
 
i know, there's a lot who are unfamiliar with this and me also
confuse or
not familiar in parallel parking
but everyday i do it,
and everyday i drove
then i became familiar with it
and got 100% in parallel parking.
And now, I'm going to teach
on how to do parallel parking in the right way
And Now,
fasten your seat-belt
 
This is the easiest way
or technique
in parallel parking.
Check this out!!
I will recommend to align the
side mirror
for the start.
More people telling that its better to allign
the back bumper with your car's back bumper instead of side mirror?
and THAT'S TRUE! but if you park your
car in the car who's smaller or bigger than your car
by aligning the side mirror, the back bumper
will be aligned also.
That's why i tell you this, my fellow OFW is
that, if you align your side mirror
instead of back bumper, is that because
we sit near the wheels and we can actually see
the mirror instead of the back bumper
and even the well experienced
driver have a hard time  aligning
the back bumper
Now, the question is, it this technique
is effective to all the time? The answers is
YES but need some adjustment
In this technique, we have two
reference point to consider
to determine the distance
when we maneuver. First,
aligning your side mirror in the side mirror
in other car beside you
and SECOND is aligning the plate
in your car's WINDOW
Actually, you can use either of the two.
but it want to use the first technique,
For example, if your car is longer
than other's car, instead of
aligning both side mirror, you can forward
a little and if your car is
smaller, you align you side mirror
backward.
After, One whole right turn maneuver
return, parallel to the plate
in the center of your window, then
maneuver whole to the left
back up, until you reach parking the parking spot
If you choose the second technique, you choose as reference
point,
Start to align
any size of the car but be sure
the space is enough. Maneuver whole
to the right, then back up.
If you car is longer, align the plate
near the right side of your window.
If you car is small,
in the left side of your window
then one whole maneuver to the left, back up
until you straight the parking.
Either of the two technique,
the side mirror or the  back plate,
always look for your reference point
that will feel you comfortable and
use it afterwards in parking parallel.
Example, if you are comfortable in the
reference point
in the window button, towards the plate
of others car, or
the handle of the door. Either ways
that make you comfortable, then do it.
See, we have another lesson learned.
the PARALLEL PARKING. I hope
you can apply this in your everyday driving.
And to those whose just starting,
i hope you learned something from me.
