some filipino budget meals for those who  
are new to pinoy planet in my garden i cook 
filipino dishes such as adobo sinigang sisig  
and filipino desserts but this time my family 
and i will go on a one-week vacation in  
center parcs center parks is a well-known 
vacation park here in the netherlands where  
you can do lots of activities such as swimming 
sports it's kind of like a bungalow park  
and there are some restaurants and shops 
it's really nice for a family just for  
uh for a couple of days you know or a week even 
the park that we will be going to is called  
de eemhof i thought it would be nice for you 
to see a vacation park here in the netherlands  
sige let's check it out sige let's check it 
out Pogi's gonna stay home for one week oh no
pogi we gonna miss you bye
i already have some ingredients 
here that i will bring to  
the center part including chicharon baboy and 
some more we are almost there malapit na tayo  
this is centerparcs de eemhof check-in okay 
let's go to check-in only tree's but maganda
let's go
we can take a boat right here on the lake the park 
is very peaceful very relaxing and quiet also and  
i have to say it's really well maintained so i'm 
gonna show you around a little bit more uh the  
buildings are so nice architecture almost doesn't 
feel like i'm in the netherlands but uh anyway i  
will be cooking palabok later in the meantime i'll 
show you a little bit more of these center parks  
our house is here let's have a 
look inside so it's pretty nice  
here you have the toilet and here is the kitchen 
small kitchen here's a fridge and there's some  
utensils pots and pans so you can do cooking here 
there's an oven and sleeping room number one table  
sleeping room number two the living room 
can make a fire so we brought some prutas  
including my favorite one papaya and here is 
outside so let's have a look let's open this door
this is the view and there's a forest 
where we can relax in the nature sounds  
and there's the tv so that's pretty much 
it for the house so now i'm gonna go to  
the supermarket they have a nice supermarket 
where we can buy uh some ingredients for the  
uh palabok because i want to make palabuk one 
or two ingredients but let's check it out okay  
so since it's a filipino budget meal the 
challenge is to stay below 75 pesos per head  
we need some spring onions we're going to 
make a recipe of panlasang pinoy which i saw  
but i'm gonna tweak it a little bit adjust 
it based on the ingredients that we have
i got the last spring onions for 
sure we're gonna need some coffee
we're ready now with the ingredients we're not 
going to cook yet because i really feel like  
going for a swim and my son has been waiting 
the whole day for going to the swimming pool  
and apparently the swimming pool here 
is one of the nicest in the netherlands
now that was lots of fun in the swimming pool 
so let's start cooking magluluto tayo i want  
to make palabok so let's have a look at the 
ingredients i'm filling this pot with water  
so this brings us to the first ingredient uh 
this is vermicelli it's uh it's not like pancit  
bihon but almost same i think because 
it's not made from rice but from wheat  
but it's very cheap it's um actually 
1 euro 25 which is approximately  
73 pesos okay 73 philippine pesos but this 
will be a good for at least three persons
the nice thing is that we only need to boil this 
for three minutes okay so i'm adding these noodles  
three minutes long so just stirring it 
a little bit i wonder for what price you  
can make a filipino budget mew can you 
stay below 70 pesos per person maybe 50  
or even 30 40 pesos per person that would 
be amazing let me know in the comments okay  
because i i'm really curious to how cheap you 
can actually make your filipino budget meal  
and together we can do the challenge 
to make it as cheap as possible
we'll remove the hot water 
the noodles look really good  
so that's the first step for our palabok we 
will be using two cloves of garlic and one onion  
we'll make a atsuette water i'm adding some 
atsuette to this boiling water it will give  
the noodles the real pinoy color diba about 20 
ml of mantika it's already smelling good yummy  
now we will add the giniling na baboy okay
this is a combination of baboy and baka 
giniling so two pieces of ground beef  
just for demonstration i'm using 300 grams 
because one package is 300 grams it would be syang  
but actually we will only use 200 grams 
for this recipe of course you can adjust  
it because this is the most expensive part of 
the dish so you could for example add 50 grams  
per person 75 grams per person depending on your 
budget okay so you can um of course put a little  
bit less because it's going to be saucy it's still 
going to be nice at this stage i'll be adding some  
paminta just a little bit of paminta okay and also 
i see you can use a chicken stock of course but i  
think it's gonna be more expensive i'm just gonna 
stick with about let's say one teaspoon of salt
now it's time to add some 
cornstarch okay i'm gonna  
first start with one tablespoon of cornstarch
we're going to add our atsueta 
seed water okay simple lang guys
set up it becomes a little bit 
sticky no looks very delicious  
we'll add some lemon juice to this spring 
onions eat look i boiled these for seven minutes  
and some chicharron baboy so i'll add a 
little bit of chicharron baboy on top of this
this is my first ever palabok 
so ready to eat let's try it
yummy tastes really good and with the lemon juice 
and the chicharron it's really nice combination  
i hope we were able to stay below 75 pesos per 
person but i think we did because actually we  
were able to um to use the noodles you know it's 
actually not for four person i thought it was for  
three but it's enough for four persons and also 
the meat the 300 grams of meat that i use can be  
for four persons so uh it's a nice uh filipino 
budget meal i think uh if you have some  
some other ideas let me know but um i'll 
see you at the tennis court okay hope you  
liked this video thanks a lot for watching let me 
know in the comments which filipino budget meal i  
should be cooking next okay looking forward 
to seeing you again maraming salamat po bye
