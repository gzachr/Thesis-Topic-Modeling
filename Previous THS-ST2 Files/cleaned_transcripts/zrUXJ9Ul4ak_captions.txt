Good morning!
Or: 
Maayong Buntag!
What's up?
It's pool time!
Today I can't be exposed to the sun...
Look at this...
I'm sunburnt...
Even using SPF50 sunscreen...
and using SPF100 in my face...
with UVA60.
It's unbelievably hot...
Love...
Yes?
Stop that love...
I'm working love...
I'm a hard working man!
They are really good!
Today was another chill day...
We just enjoyed the resort pool...
Look! We're already arriving at South Palms...
We checked out from Amorita...
And we're heading to another resort.
It's close to Amorita.
Btw, Im feeling a bit better...
But I've my nose obstructed.
And being here feeling like that isn't the coolest thing...
So we asked our driver to stop at the Pharmacy.
We only paid 9 euros for 3 boxes of Strepsils...
Paracetamol...
Aloe vera, alcohol...
and a mucolytic box.
Only 9 euros!
Now we're chilling the rest of the afternoon...
But at South Palms.
Dani, you wake up and have the Beach right in front you...
This room isn't that big...
But look at this view...
Amazing!
We're right in front of the beach.
Did you think I would stop recording?
Make fun of me as long as you want... It won't stop me!
Today we're with a driver/guide from Bisayang Travelista...
To get to know Bohol's best spots...
Not sure if we're going to see all of them because I'm still feeling a bit sick...
But this one we couldn't miss:
The Chocolate Hills!
One of the fun facts he shared with us is that if we count them...
They are 1268 hills.
I asked him why they were called Chocolate Hills...
and He said that it's because they get fully brown during summer time.
Now, if we notice...
There's a lot of green so I would say they're...
Mint Chocolate Hills?!
Bohol is also known for the Tarsier.
These lovely creatures!
They are small primates...
that only eat insects.
Here, in this semi-wild environment... at night, when they are active because they are resting now...
The place is light up to attract insects so they can eat.
They don't survive in captivity...
because they hurt each other and themselves...
Another fact that Jojo also shared...
Is that they have a 360º head moveability...
180º to one side and 180º to the other.
Who would guess, right?
A bridge like this, bamboo made...
Before the 2º World War...
Would be now a touristic spot.
It's a bit shaky, right?
Are you feeling it?
Are you afraid?
Not quite...
How's the experience, Indiana Jones?
Cute!
There's no reason to feel fear while walking around...
But what really makes me curious about this...
Is to picture that by the 2º World War...
Local people used this to carry stuff around...
So they could cross from one side to another...
This was somewhat of a shortcut...
To avoid main roads.
And a few minutes ago we saw a dog super relaxed crossing by...
What is this stuff here?
Don't know... I also saw that...
And I took it to eat...
Really?
Yeah...
Looks like Aloe Vera...
By the looks of it...
Might be good...
I'm off sync...
