- So, thank you guys
for joining us today.
So, first of all,
what country are you from?
- Brazil. Thanks for having me.
- I'm from Scotland.
- I'm from England.
- I'm from India.
- I'm from the Philippines.
- Australia.
- We actually asked our viewers
to audition to be on the show,
and we're excited to have people
from six different countries
for this language-themed episode
that we're doing today.
So, we are having a lot
of fun doing this with our fans
from all over.
And to those watching,
if you wanna find out about auditions,
subscribe to our newsletter.
The links to that will be below.
So, for this episode,
you guys are going to try
and pronounce the hardest words
from the other person's country.
- Oh. (laughs)
- That's gonna be bad.
- (FBE) For round one,
Megan, the first Hindi word
will be here on the screen,
and we're gonna see
if you can pronounce this.
Starting off easy.
- Okay.
Um...
'Ack-cha'?
- (chuckles) Sorry.
- No? (laughs)
- Oh, I don't even know
where to begin with that.
It seems like it would make
an 's' type of sound.
Or maybe like a 'th'
like 'kah-bess-uh, dup'?
- 'Soos-mar-yo-sep' maybe?
- I think you did okay. Yeah. Nice.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
- I would say it's pretty fair.
It's not that bad. I could get
what she was trying to say.
- The beginning of the word is okay.
Only the last part is a little wrong.
'Ka-bess-ah-doo-rah'.
- Oh, wow.
- 'Kah-bess-ah,' okay.
'Doo-rah.' Strong.
- It's like an expression.
'Sus' is like Jesus.
And then 'Mari,'
Mary, Joseph.
Like, if you're angry
or something, you just say that,
I guess. (laughs) I feel like
more of the older people say it.
- Cabeça-dura is a person
who is very hard to--
let me say you have an idea.
I say, "Let's go to the that place.
It's the right place."
You say, "No, it's that one,"
and you keep doing, you know,
"It's that one."
Everyone know this one is the right.
You are a cabeça-dura.
- So, actually, it's--
okay, so the word itself means good,
but it can have a lot of meanings.
Like, for example, if, you know,
I explain something, and you go,
"Oh, okay, cool."
So, in India, you can just go,
(speaks Hindi),
like "achcha,"
so it's just a very blanket term
for good or okay or understood,
stuff like that.
- (FBE) Marielli, it's gonna
be your turn.
So, here is the Australian slang word
that we have for you.
- 'Ah-kah-dah-kah'?
Or is it like--
do you say like, 'ch,'
like 'ah-cha-dah-cha'
or something? (laughs)
- 'Gly-kit'.
'Gly-kit.'
'Glah-kit.' (laughs)
- Is it 'nak-erd'?
'Nak-erd,' right?
- Yup. (laughs)
- I'm not totally sure
I even know what this word is.
I don't think I know this word.
- It's apparently an adjective
used to describe a stupid,
foolish, thoughtless
person or an action.
- I've never heard that.
Looking at it,
I would maybe say 'glay-kit.'
- 'Ah-kah-dah-kah.'
- Yeah.
- What is that?
- You know AC/DC? Band?
- Oh. Yeah.
- Yeah. It's that.
- Why?
- I think.
- (laughs) You make it longer.
- Why not?
- So, it just means like
you're basically just really tired.
Like, you're just so tired,
you're knackered. (chuckles)
- I used to watch
the Graham Norton show
quite a lot when I was younger.
Other than that,
the English in India is pretty--
pronunciation is more borderline,
I would say, British than American.
So, I guess that's why
it kind of helps.
Plus, a lot of us here in India
grew up reading Harry Potter
and stuff, so we're kind of familiar
with these words.
- (FBE) For round two,
these are words that you feel
are the hardest words
to pronounce in your country,
which you sent us earlier.
So, we're gonna put them to the test.
So, Anna, this is the word
that Dieggo chose as his country's
hardest word.
So, let's give it a go.
- (laughs)
- (chuckles) There is no way
I can say that.
- Oh, okay.
- Oof.
- Holy...
- (laughs)
- 'Naka-kap-bag'-- I don't know.
'Naka-kap-bag-bag-aga-baguette'?
I don't know.
- (laughs)
- That was pretty poor.
- Oh, god. I wanna say it.
Like 'Prath-mop-pa-char.'
- I don't mean to be mean,
but not that good. (laughs)
- No, I didn't feel
like I did that good.
- (laughs)
- Totally-- I've lost it. No.
'Oh-torring-no-laring-gol-oh-gee-sta.'
- Yeah. She did
pretty good actually.
It's 'oh-to-hee-no-
la-ringo-lo-jee-sta.'
(laughs)
- Wow.
- It's a doctor who
see the ear issues.
- 'Na-kaka-pag-pa-bag-abag.''
Oh my gosh. I had to--
I had to practice this.
Honestly, I don't remember
what it means. Oh my gosh.
I'm such a bad Filipino. (chuckles)
'Na-kaka-pag-pa-bag-abag.'
- So, from what I'm aware of,
it goes 'pra-ta-mop-char,'
which basically means first aid.
But it's not a very common word,
and a lot of Indians
have trouble pronouncing it.
And I think a lot of Indians
don't even know
what the word even was.
- I follow the--
'donner'? 'Downer'?
'Downer' or 'donner'? (chuckles)
- Wow. Okay.
It's some sort of phobia. Okay.
- 'Hippo-poto-monstrous-
kwik-allee-oh-pho-bee-ah'?
- Onomatopoeia. (chuckles)
- Yeah.
- It's the-- oh my gosh. Hmm.
I don't know the--
it's what we studied
in English class.
- It's 'donner.'
- 'Donner'!
(claps) Woo-hoo!
- It means to go for a stroll
or a walk.
- Yeah, I think she did--
I don't think even I could
say that to be fair. (laughs)
- The only thing that I can get
is that it's some sort of phobia,
but that's kind of it.
I'm really not sure.
- I think it's the phobia
of really long words. Is that's right?
- Wow. Okay.
- (FBE) You're correct.
So, time for our last round.
So we went to Google,
and we searched for the hardest words
in each of your countries.
And each of you will take a shot
at your own country's word.
We're not language experts,
so we're gonna let Google Translate
do the pronunciation for us.
- Yeah. Let's go for it.
- 'Awk-tah-muk-tee'?
I don't think I've seen that.
- It's a town in Scotland.
- Oh.
- Yeah, I thought it would be.
It's one of those words
that I look at
and I really struggle with.
(chuckles) I just really struggle.
'Wuss-ter-shir.'
I think that's how you say it.
(chuckles)
- 'Kur-nul.'
- (FBE) You got that correct.
- Yeah, that's easy.
- Like Colonel Sanders.
- Not really. It's just--
You just sort of...
- Like when you get KFC.
- I think it's all the words together.
You've got the C,
and then you've got that 'er'
before the 'shire.'
I really struggle. It's almost like
a little tongue twister to me.
I find it easier
actually looking at the word.
If I'm trying to think
about saying it without seeing it,
I struggle to say it. (chuckles)
- Oh my gosh.
I saw this! I saw this.
- 'Pina-ka'--
'pina-ka-naka-pag-papa-gah-bag.'
(speaking gibberish)
Again, again, again.
'Pina-ka-naka-pag-papa-bag-ah-bag,
dum-dah-min.' (chuckles)
- 'Pin-ah-kun-kapa-pag-bag-un,
dum-dah-min.'
- (laughs)
- I know what it is,
but I don't know how
to pronounce it. (chuckles)
'Pee-neel-muh-ootra-
mee-kro-sko-pee-oh-soo-
loo-hoo-kun-yon-tee-ko.'
(laughs)
- 'Noo-mo-ultra-microscopic'...
The end, I don't really know.
(chuckles)
- Oh, okay. I think it goes
'kin-kar-tav-yuh-vee-moo.'
I think that's the pronunciation.
- I'm not even gonna try. (laughs)
Honest, I would not succeed in that.
- It's just the 'nakakapagpapabagab'
but with feelings. Or am I wrong?
(laughs) I don't know.
- So, here's how Google Translate
says that it's pronounced.
So, let's give it a listen.
- (computer) 'Pina-ka-na-kapag-
papa-bagabag-dam-damin.'
- I feel like even she had
a hard time saying that. (laughs)
- (computer) 'Kin-kar-ta-vya-vee-moo.'
- I would say I was close enough.
Maybe not the way my grandmother
would have liked it,
but close enough.
- It's strange how everyone
is so different with words.
You look at it,
and you think it sounds one way,
and it's completely not what you
expect it to be. (chuckles)
- Even if I speak Filipino
and stuff, I have a hard time
saying a lot of the words.
I even forgot the meaning
of the word I gave.
Like, my gosh.
- Being from India,
I've always been--
I've come across quite a lot
of languages, because India itself
has like 22 official languages,
English included.
And I grew up trying to learn
a lot of these languages.
It's always really intrigued me
how different certain languages
sound to the ear,
but a lot of the times
have the same meanings.
- Before we let you guys go,
based on this experience,
do you guys have any advice
for maybe somebody looking
at different languages as barriers
rather than bridges?
- I don't know. I've never like--
if you're planning on going
to different countries,
then research it,
try and learn stuff
before you go.
Look into it more.
- Some people think, like,
"Oh, my language is more superior"
or something, and I think
with this experience and how--
if you travel around the world,
you realize that there's so many
really beautiful languages.
- See, it's very tough
when you start,
but once you come across, you know,
content in that language,
and you try to read stuff,
converse in that language,
you realize that it's
a pretty great thing,
because you've come across
this entire new culture
and ideas and thoughts.
- You just appreciate a lot more,
like, the culture of other people
and yeah, how they express themselves.
- Thanks for letting me
represent Australia on FBE.
- Which of these hardest words
were your favorite to learn?
Let us know in the comments.
- Thanks for watching. Paalam!
- Hey, everyone. Lauren,
producer here at FBE.
Thank you guys so much for watching
this international episode.
What other countries
should we try this with next?
Let us know in the comments
and maybe we'll do it next time.
Bye, everyone!
