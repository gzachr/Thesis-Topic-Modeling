let's eat isn't it amazing
wow
[Music]
hello everybody and welcome back to my
channel it's me again your girl
diana and guys today is another vlog
today
is tuesday it's 10 41
august 3. so um
without further ado guys let's start
cooking because
um chris told me that he has uh here's
some errands to do today so
this needs to be quick thinking last
night that i'm going to do
uh some what they call it
mungos guys mongoose or hmong beans but
i don't have mung beans guys that's why
i decided you know what let me just do
some bistik or this
is a filipino style beef steak
the difference is with a beef steak like
your normal beef sticks like european
you don't really put
soya sauce in it but in the philippines
we like to put soya sauce that's why
it's called
steak so we have some beef here this is
what we bought yesterday i'm just going
to
add some salt and
[Music]
oh god i'm pepper out of pepper guys so
we just put everything in
and we need some
okay sorry guys we need some soya sauce
it would have been nice if i could
marinate this one for at least an hour
but uh we don't have time today guys so
i'm just going to
mix everything in and then cook them
directly
so what else i have here some powder
this one
is um garlic powder
and no i'm gonna put this oyster sauce
later
also going to put our garlic
and onion so we don't have much
ingredients for this guys we will only
need
steak or beef beef steak so
that's how they look like and
some broccoli and of course guys this is
just optional i have here some
bell pepper i have yellow and green bell
pepper so i want to add some but
you don't have to and this one is just
the hard part of the broccoli and of
course your garlic
and your um your onions that's it guys
nothing more so let me just mix this all
up
what time are you going out then
and of course guys for the sauce i'm
just going to add
some beef beef bouillon you can have you
can add
beef cubes you can have beef stock
whatever you have in your kitchen if you
don't have one you don't need to
it's optional and i want the sauce to be
a little bit thick so i have here some
cornstarch
this one's optional too if you don't
want your sauce to be thick then you
don't have to end
some some sourness i
am going to add a dash of
lemon extract that's it easy so
let's go
[Music]
gonna eat then um the lunch later
instead
because he couldn't make it guys he
couldn't make it his
time constrained and i told him you know
what i'm just eating later
you can um have some sandwich with you
and
that's it so our food is almost done i'm
just gonna put a splash of our
lemon extract look at that guys
wow yummy let's eat
padding that's my lunch
so this is just the first um what do you
call it
first round so of course i have my rice
i place it in the very bottom guys and
the sauce on top
so let's eat let's try this one how it
tastes like
mmm
the meat is really tender i cook the
meat first
for around four now
not really 40 minutes that's too long
now 25 30 minutes guys
and it's really really tender now i hope
you try this at home
it's very easy of course you don't have
to put all the um vegetables you know if
you or not
if you're not the type of person who
likes to eat a lot of vegetables but i'm
just doing it extra because um
you know it's it's healthier i even cook
some potatoes for chris because of
course he prefers potatoes rather than
rice so he can eat that later
um i can put it in the microwave once
he's home or i don't know maybe later
tonight he's gonna eat it
uh i'll ask him but that's basically it
for our recipe for today
we still need to make the mango float
later
our list is here guys of course i did it
yesterday it's here
this is here so we need to go to
the m to buy my my powder my matcha
powder
the mango float crackers and
the mango float no put mango float
crackers the uh graham no the butter
cookies
and some whipped cream because i don't
have whipped cream anymore
grab it
guys while we are waiting i'm just gonna
do some
slight editing i'm not gonna wait for
space to arrive guys i'm just going to
the supermarket i'm gonna buy the stuff
that we need for our dessert or mango
float for later
and then by the time chris arrives we
can
have someone go float because we need to
chill it first as you can see
this drink is very diluted supposed to
be
like green green and color not really
green like
a little bit darker than this but this
is just
it turned out to be pastel green let me
taste how it tastes like
it tastes like soy milk with a bit of um
with a bit of tea i'm watching
netflix by the way and this is the
title the cushion fun customer
i'm not really sure if it's showing also
in the philippines
and now on i'm going to show it to you
[Music]
one customer so i'm now on
orgasex so while i'm editing
i'm watching at the same time
multitasking
and drinking cheers go buy some crackers
so
in my list i only have three things in
my list
i hope i go out with three and not five
this is the problem every time every
time i go inside
the uh the grocery store
i only need one thing and then when i go
out i have five things already
guys let's do this as i mentioned
we only need three things three things
and what's
inside here guys in my
shopping bag it's a total of five things
so first things first look what i found
this is what we're gonna use later for
our um
our mango float it's very cute and the
good thing about this one guys it's it's
glass
i have a lot of container at home but
they're made with plastic and i like it
to be glass i've never had something
like this so
and it has a lid on that's cute a dog i
have something like this guys but
without a lid on
so this is something different so i
bought one and that cost me around
four euro 45
and i bought our of course our butter
cookies or in german we call it butter
cakes
and um this one's original this one's
good
but i found this one too
[Music]
uh this one's less sugar 30 less sugar
and i wanted to try this one but um
i'm not really sure if they taste good
guys that's why i
i bought also this one in case
this one doesn't taste any good so
we'll see how they taste like and
and the last no there's last two this
one's my
whipping cream and i am using the ones
with less
sugar not less sugar less fat 30
less fat and this one we don't have it
guys we don't have
um pepper anymore so that's why i bought
them
so that's it now we are ready to get
home
and start making our no bake dessert
we're now back in the kitchen and let me
just drink some water
so let's start with assembling our
no-bake dessert i tell you guys if you
haven't made mango float in the past
it's so easy never go wrong with mango
float you know there's not
it's unlike baking guys you don't have
to measure anything you just have to
uh get some mangoes put some cream on
top
with a little bit of condensed milk and
to layer everything you need some
cookies uh ideally in the philippines we
use
grahams but since i don't have grahams
with me
i can order it online guys but i don't
want to order extra
because it's it's expensive and and here
in germany we use this one that's
we call it butter butter cakes or butter
cookies
and they taste more or less the same and
they're really good
they're good for uh when you know when
you have kids with you
and you just want to have some snacks
together with your kids then
get this one this is really good so okay
uh our mangoes they're ripe they're
sweet
and i've already sliced it
so we don't have to do that part anymore
uh in the video so that's already done
and
of course our container here it is guys
the
ones we just bought and i already uh
washed
and dried them so now let's mix
everything
so in here i'm using some
chilled cream heavy cream just make sure
that your cream is really chilled
because it's easier to whip
and i have here some condensed milk so
you don't
have to use the entire bottle for this
so it depends
how sweet you like your mango float but
in this case
i'm not also sure how much i'm just
going to taste it
to taste my cream and if they need some
more sweetness then i'll add more
and if they don't then i know maybe just
use the half
sorry
come on
we're done oh in case you're wondering
what this is this
is a cream stabilizer so here in germany
um they have this cream stabilizer
because they usually
you know when they bake cakes they um
like using
uh whipping cream uh and the problem
with whipping cream guys they met they
tend to mark that's why
they have this one they put they
incorporate this on
their whipped cream so it stays
so this is what i just used and i use
one and a half of the packet because one
one of this uh is to 200 grams of cream
and i'm not really sure how much
cream i used i think i think 400
but i didn't finish the entire packet so
that's
uh that's it but you don't need to use
this one guys if if you don't have
this um stabilizer then you don't have
to
the flavor it doesn't change anything
it's just that with a stabilizer
see it stabilizes your cream it doesn't
move
that's why i really like using it
so what we're gonna do now guys is just
to assemble everything
and
i'm not really sure what what kind of
uh cookies i'm going to use either the
original or the
less sugar but i want to taste it i
think this one is
yeah this one's the 30 less sugar
mmm
is good
[Music]
the original this one's original
with normal sugar content
tastes the same really
the same more
bro
i therefore conclude that if you're
living in germany
and you don't know which crackers to get
just get this um the price is the same
although you get more of these i think
see guys this is a little bit thicker
this one's a little bit skinnier
but if you don't want the extra sugar
then get this instead
so they taste the same i tell you so we
start with the cookies first
there we go
[Applause]
this is already broken oh no
[Music]
i love the cream
or should i start no you know what guys
let me start with this
let me start with my mangoes point
layer everything
look how thick that cream is
i know
hmm
hmm
hmm
um
there you go oh my god look at that
isn't it amazing wow look at the layers
of course you can do more layers if you
want to but
since my container is really not that
deep so i only made i think
i think around two
only two guys so that's it i still have
one more container here my plastic
container
[Music]
here
daddy
so
um
but in case you're wondering what this
is this is actually a pureed mangoes
guys wait you know what let me just put
the rest here
there you go
now they're ready to chill
right this is home but it's not gonna
stay
so long as it's just gonna end so as you
can see i already
put some potatoes in here
chris is injured he was pushing the uh
he was pushing the
the what you call it the van guys and
then the wheel caught his leg
[Applause]
is it broken or is it still intact
does it look a little bit like a lion
guys because this didn't there's some
hairstyle exclusive
style porgy you can professionalism it's
in this choice
different from the back it's actually
not that bad
style i hope this is ready honey
i hope this is not falling apart because
we need to chill it for
uh

be firm
