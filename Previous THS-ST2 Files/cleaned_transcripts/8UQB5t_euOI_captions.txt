Today we're making the most classic
Filipino dish....Pork Adobo.  Here are the
ingredients.  Pork belly, garlic, bay leaves,
soy sauce, vinegar,
and whole peppercorns.  Let's start with the
pork belly.  We're gonna fry these until
they turn golden brown and crispy.
When they're ready push all the meat to
the side so we can remove some of the
excess oil.  Now we can saute the garlic.
Give it a mix.
Add the whole peppercorns.
Then the bay leaves.  Then add the vinegar
and wait a couple of minutes before
mixing.  Then we'll add the soy sauce. Make
sure to only use Filipino brand soy
sauce and vinegar if you're looking for
the authentic Filipino adobo taste.
Add 2 cups of water.  When it boils reduce
the heat to medium-low.  Let this simmer
for 30 minutes or until the meat is
tender and the sauce is to your liking.
Some like their adobo dry and some like
them saucy.  I like my adobo just right in
between.  This is perfect and ready.  The
signature dish of the Philippines.....Pork
Adobo.  Enjoy!  Thank you for watching.
