all right so it looks like we're just
going to wait for everybody else some of
them have already showed up I'm just
walking around to see if we can find
others but in the meantime I want you to
meet the two other Filipino bloggers
here in Amsterdam in the Netherlands
hi guys welcome to another episode of
pinay mom's blogs where we share about
the things we do and the places we see
here in Amsterdam and beyond and today
our episode is a bit different I'm about
to go to the city centre and on my way
there I'll show you around
common touristy landmarks along my way
so probably for example damrak royal
palace the flower market and maybe a few
houseboats on the canals I'm going there
today to meet up with more filipino
vloggers from the netherlands because
we're like we're all over the country
and this afternoon's a bit special
because the meet up will be here on my
home turf in amsterdam it's a bit chilly
out here today 3 degrees and very cloudy
but I'll still take the opportunity to
show you around the city ok so join me
there
to get to the city center from our
neighborhood I need to take a subway
train known here as the Metro commuters
here require a public transport pass
that can be used in buses trams and
metros you can purchase by the hour or
by the day or you can have a monthly
subscription where you can top off your
cards as needed just like mine
hi guys I'm back I just arrived here in
Central Station and I'm gonna go walk towards
the front where the meeting
place is gonna be at
I'm gonna go look for Dunkin Donuts and
that's we're gonna meet so see you in a bit
this is going to be my second meet and greet with the filipino vloggers my first one
was held in the Hague and we all had a
great time we had a lot of fun we also
got to know each other sharing our
experiences about vlogging but now since
I'm a bit early I'm just going to go
around and do some window shopping first
the Amsterdam Central Station is the
biggest transfer spot for trams trains
and buses here in the Netherlands it's
also a major international railway hub
so you can imagine it's got to have some
nice shops inside the train station for
locals and tourists alike
okay guys so I'm here in the meeting
area apparently it's not "Ijpassage" but "Amstelpassage"
my bad sorry and there is
Dunkin Donuts can you see it all right
