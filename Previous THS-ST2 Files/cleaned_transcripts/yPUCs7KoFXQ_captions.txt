last time I reacted the video of SB19 from wish107.5
since then I kinda into them
so this time I will react the video of SB19 music video "GO UP"
filipino version of korean Idol, or Japanese Idol like ARASHI
they kinda like mix of their culture but its original filipino pop
its interesting 
I like their fashion and makeup so lets watch it
drone shot na
 they looks like Johnny's of japan idol 
I like the edit which is same position transition 
well yeah they really not look like filipino 
 last time when I posted video of SB19, viewers told me their pure filipinos  
 I got full of energy, positive vibes from them 
still its morning now, its so good to hear from the start of your day
I feel like I wanna go shopping so hard right now cuz of their song lol
well, I still feel like they are not pure filipinos 
just maybe because of their make up, 
I have been to PH a lot of times but I never seen those of filipinos yet
SB19 is famous now so maybe filipino people will make up too, and they try to look like them 
just maybe already a lot of people do a make up and stuff like SB19
same as Japan, you know there is a category of people 
like, skateboarder look, idol look, otaku look...etc
maybe its new for filipino, like SB19 idol look
 its sucks i cant go to PH now but when Corona is over, around 2021 or 2022
but when i go there again i would love to see SB19 look filipino boys!
its gonna be fun!
 okay, this time I watched the video of SB19
next time I wanna watch more great artist video so please leave a comment around here
