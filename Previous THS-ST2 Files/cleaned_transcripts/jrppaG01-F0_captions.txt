hello guys
today i'm gonna try something new in my
channel for the very first time
i talked a lot about slovak food stuff
about slovakia but in this video
i'm gonna share with you for the first
time something filipino
a lot of you have requested me to do
this for quite a while now and i'm not
really sure why i never done it so far
so anyways today i decided to share with
you guys one of my most
favorite street food in the philippines
and it's called
lugao this is really famous
in the philippines so you will find a
lot of variation of the recipe over the
internet but today what i'm going to
share with you
is i think the best combination for me
this
is usually eaten for breakfast by
filipinos but to be honest i like it so
much
that i can eat it any time of the day
i'm not gonna go over with all the
ingredients that i will be using for
today but i will leave it in the screen
right now so you can check it out also
i will put the all the ingredients in
the step-by-step process in the
description below so if you want to try
it as well you can go ahead and check it
out later
now let's start cooking and i promise
you it's going to be super
easy and super yummy so welcome to our
kitchen we are in the old house today so
nothing fancy
really so we're gonna start by sauteing
the garlic the onion
and the ginger this is the basic
foundation
of filipino cuisine majority of the
dishes that we do
is that we start by sauteing the garlic
onion
and ginger and chili just put the garlic
let's also put the onion
and the ginger
so now that the onion garlic and ginger
cooked we're just gonna add our chicken
i use chicken thai because this is my
favorite part of the chicken but you can
use whatever um part of the chicken you
like some people like to put it there
the wing part
the leg part but today i'm using chicken
time in the philippines we go crazy
what we put in dugout and that is the
best thing about lugao i would say
because it's so versatile that you can
put whatever
meat or part of the meat that you like
some people
put there some heart
of the pig or a cow some food
stomach or the intestine i really like
it by the way
it's kind of weird i know but i like it
i think it's good combination as well
i know that you guys slovaks are very
well familiar with that because
you're using it in zabiyat as well oh
and i have a video about that if you
haven't seen it i'll leave the link in
the description below
also some people like to put there some
tongue of the pig or the cow and some
people
also put some eyes on
the pig or cow i'm not sure but
i i know that it's so gross hearing it
but a lot of people in the philippines
really like it i never tried it because
it's too much for me but maybe you guys
will like it
who knows so we're just gonna keep on
cooking the chickens
and don't forget to add
salt so that our chicken will be tasty
you really don't have to overcook this
chicken because we're gonna cook it with
the rice
you can skip meat if you don't like it
and the luga will still be very good
but today my husband is a vegan and i'm
gonna make him
try this let's see if he's gonna try it
so now that the chicken
is i think ready we're gonna add
water now
i put water but if you have a chicken
broth vegetable broth that would be a
lot
better and after adding the water we're
gonna add
the rice so we're just gonna add this
rice i washed it
twice with water some people don't like
washing their rice but i do
and this rice is a sticky rice
today i use a sticky rice but if you
cannot find any sticky rice at all it's
perfectly fine you can use just normal
rice in your house
but the recipe the original recipe calls
for sticky rice but
to be honest um it would just be a
difference of thickness your if you use
thicker eyes
your luga will be a lot thicker which is
really nice but if you use a normal rice
it's totally fine i've tried it many
times before and i'm totally
satisfied with the result because in the
philippines you know sticky rice we call
it malakit
it's much more expensive like double the
price of the normal rice
so what people do is that they put a
little bit of sticky rice and then
add more of the normal rice and it works
totally fine
so if you don't have sticky rice just
use a normal rice that's totally fine
so now that everything is there we're
just going to leave this to cook the
rice
and the chicken more and don't forget to
occasionally
stir it so that the rice will not settle
at the bottom and also stick to the pan
all right guys so our lugo is looking
very nice it's time to season it with
salt
just put some salt there it depends on
how
much salty you want your nougat to be
and
we're also going to add my favorite
ground
pepper also you can add fish
sauce if you have but i don't have it
here but in the philippines it's very
common that we add it in our
dishes it has a very nice umami taste
so let's just hear this and i'm still
gonna keep on cooking it for a couple of
minutes until my chicken is
tender
[Music]
all right guys our lugo is ready
um let's try to garnish it and make it
fancy
so my husband will eat it
smelling so good
all right so the way we garnish it is
that
we add some spring onion
on top you can use a scallion if you
like i tried it before as well and it's
nice and the best thing
is adding toasted or roasted garlic
it's very crispy which add more texture
to our lugo
and we're going to add also slice of
boiled egg there
looking so nice and also i'm gonna add
more
um spring onion
so this is my logo and if i'm in the
philippines i am normally adding
calamansi there and a dash of pepper but
i don't have my calamansi
here in europe so we can use
um lemon but it tastes a bit different
so i will just
skip it kalamazoo is normally this small
um green lemon but the taste is so
much better i hope you guys can try it
so
this is our final product
that is my luca looks so beautiful
and i think if you guys ask me
although in the philippines there are a
lot of variation what you can pair with
lugo but for my
opinion the best to pair with lugao
is what we call tokua
baboy tokua means tofu
this is tofu and baboi means
pig so basically this is part of the
uh pig the tender one we call it in
filipino liempo but i don't know what is
it
in belly yeah belly belly this part is
the belly of the pink
you just fry it and
very filipino that is authentic and
distinguishable
for us is paring everything almost all
the fried and grilled and stuff like
that
dishes is that having and soy sauce with
uh
i i like mine with um vinegar on it
and i put also some onion fresh onion on
it
and it's really really tasty so
this one is paired and you eat it with
alugo all right guys it's tasting time
i'm so excited i
missed this so much i never i haven't
cook it in europe for
ever since i came here so this is the
first time again that i am
trying lugow and i'm so excited
i want to taste it first before i make
my husband try it to make sure that i
will not disappoint myself
so let's try
my mouth is watering i feel so excited
um
guys this is just exactly how i imagine
it should be
it's so tasty and the garlic and the
spring onion adds so
much so much flavor into it so good now
when we try the chocolate baby what we
usually do is just dip
it like this with soy sauce
put some onion there and look at this
eat it
so crispy and
the the combination of the soyuz vinegar
and onion is
so the best this is really typical
filipino
sauce sometimes if it's me i would add
more chili there i have there
but now i didn't add it because i'm
gonna make my husband try this
so i hope she will like it now let's go
ask him to try it
try it it's a bit um hot so be careful
do you like it also try the chicken
there's a chicken inside
good good good extra egg
try it with the egg my mother-in-law is
in the house
so i'm gonna make her try my lugo and
see if she will like it
[Laughter]
[Music]
nobody
[Music]
um
[Laughter]
yeah small trivia about lugo is that in
the philippines
you may hear it in three ways there is
goto there is aroscaldo there is
luca but for me they are totally the
same but the difference
the main difference is what kind of meat
or what part of the meat you add there
so for example today we use chicken so
it's called aroscaldo and for goto
normally they add they're the beef
tribes
and lugao is just plain rice
salt and water and then that's it and
aristotle is actually spanish word
but this one is original in china
it's inspired by the dish called kanji
you guys may recognize it
but spanish they have problem
pronouncing the word so they say aros
but for us filipino we call it lugao and
i remember back when i was
studying i used to eat it a lot because
it's so cheap and i save a lot of money
from my allowance
so i would say it's a food for
poor people but totally totally so
delicious
all right guys the logo is approved by
my slovak family i am pretty sure that
my family and friends in the philippines
will be so thrilled to know that my
slovak family here like
lugao so tell me guys what to think of
lugo
and if you are going to try it as well
i'm really excited to know what is your
opinion about this dish
