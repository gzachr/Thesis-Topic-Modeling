hey what's up Chad here so many of you
have probably heard of this incredible
place in Manila the Venice Grand Canal
mall it's really quite impressive the
way they recreated a little piece of
Venice Italy and made it the focal point
of this high-end mall it's such a cool
place to come to dine do some shopping
or just walk around and take in the
scenery and then of course you have the
famous BGC right next door a massive
business and lifestyle District it's
super impressive with its modern
architecture Lush Landscaping all the
parks and endless dining and shopping
these areas in particular are often
called the bubbles within Manila and are
quite different than the majority of
Manila so I've been staying in a
neighborhood called Tembo in Makati City
directly across the highway from BGC and
I want to take you on a little walk and
talk to check it out and just see what
it's like outside the BGC bubble
hey what's up guys all right this
that is BGC over there I'm walking
against the grain here on the wrong side
of the road that I want to show you all
right
so this highway right here divides BGC
and Pembo Makati neighborhood that I'm
staying in so all the amazingness of BGC
is literally it starts right there we
got SM aura mall right there
and then you cross the road and it's a
little different over here
very different in terms of like the
modern high-end fancy money money
but this is more typical around the
Philippines I like it I'm staying in
here you can walk out you got wet and
dry markets and yeah there's a lot more
people it's not
modern fancy
but um you know what like I didn't come
to the Philippines for that people are
super nice here
there's lots of good food options you
come out and you grab produce or you
grab some fish go home cook it up
I like that I really like that that's
what I got used to so far in the last
few months
and uh kind of like being here and I can
just pop over the highway and
see whenever I want to
but it's yeah
you know a little more hustle a little
more bustle
people are coming back from work it's
about 5 p.m right now
so the crowds are starting to
pick up
pretty much busy all the day throughout
the day but it definitely gets super
busy around this time
[Applause]
so we got lots of different stuff dried
fish
lots of lots of fish options
produce
different vibe over here this is outside
the bubble
get your rice
we got little Salon shops
man you literally are right on the edge
of where cars and motorbikes are coming
through you got to watch your heels for
sure
all right this guy here Cooks milk fish
right here on the barbecue we've eaten
this many times so good we ate it the
other day thank you
I've eaten yeah this this place is
pretty good too these guys are super
nice what they got today they often have
like Pompano and
do they have here oh they do have some
Pompano there

primarily eating milk fish for the last
while

the way home from work
Rose is shopping for something here
what do we checking here
a nail file oh shoot yeah
girl problems eh
guys walk and talk I'm gonna do a bunch
of these where I wherever I go in the
Philippines
try to make it feel as raw and natural
as can be as if you're just kind of
cruising the streets here
whether it be to just see what it's like
in another
City or island or part of the world or
if it's something you want to see to
determine if it's where you want to go
like if you come to BGC could you
come and stay in a place like this you
know
the place that we're staying at is right
off of this Main Street you literally
just walk out the door and you're kind
of in the middle of this I love it but
it might not be everyone's thing so
videos like this can kind of give you a
feel for what your options are and just
experience something unique
definitely all of this is just great
experience for me for sure
love the reggae music
all right we just got our laundry and we
just went off the main street here where
I was just walking and this is where the
apartment is
kind of in the back in an Alleyway it's
a sort of a compound multiple it's a few
apartments she airbnbs a couple out and
the family lives here too and they got
some they got the guard dogs right here
hey buddy toffee hey buddy oh it's the
friendliest dog ever anybody this guy
welcomes us every time we come home eh
that's where we're staying for
20 bucks you can actually see the high
rises back there that's an EGC literally
10 minutes and you're in the BGC bubble
loving that part of the Metro Manila
which is obviously phenomenal so we did
not plan for this so it's a mess Rose is
frantically trying to tidy up
actually you know what
I have footage that I took the other day
I'm going to cut to that
and that'll show you the apartment when
it's more clean all right this is what
you get in a little neighborhood across
the highway from b g c so you get a
little mini fridge a little eating area
everything you need for cooking nothing
fancy you got the one burner you got the
microwave makes some pretty decent meals
though you got all your pots and pans
you got your rice maker you got your
sink pretty decent bathroom
you get a separate bedroom in here it's
pretty cute you know I don't even use
that word cute but it's cute a little
paint on the brick behind the bed you
got a TV cable internet
closet
I mean guys for a budget apartment
actually you know what before we wrap
this up let's go get some dinner milk
fish and veggies this is kind of where
we started
came down from up there BGC

something like that wait three six bucks
six seven bucks 300 and we're gonna have
extra guys that's it thanks for watching
hope you enjoyed it walk and talk in
Pembo Makati Manila if you come to this
area I highly recommend if you want to
save a few bucks and experience
something a little bit more authentic in
my opinion
come to Pembo Makati across the street
from BGC and you'll love both sides both
sides of the Philippines which is both
amazing
