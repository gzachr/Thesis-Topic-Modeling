Hello.
Well, hello.
Manila?
Hi. Oh my God. Look at you.
I'm Manila Luzan.
I am a creative little kid
from the Midwest
whose creativity
was too big for Minnesota.
So I moved to New York City.
Oh, I'm so happy you're here.
Now is that a nursing bra?
Well, I thought they
looked like rivets.
So I went for a submarine
look for my torpedoes.
You don't have boyfriend?
I don't. I'm single.
Oh, I have brother.
You should hook up with him.
You should marry.
Immigration. Lots of money.
