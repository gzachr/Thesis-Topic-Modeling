when the sun goes down and the band won't 
play i'll always remember us this is
hello there emerson here again
the song today  
let's see if i remember that hair is on the sky
burning in your eyes
you look at me and baby want wanna catch on fire 
it's buried in my stone like california cold
you found the light in me that i couldn't
every time we say goodbye  
when the sun goes down and the band won't play  
we don't know how to ride but then 
we try but all i really know is
part of me that you will never die
so when i'm more choked up 
and i'll give her the words  
when the sun goes down and
i don't wanna be just a memory baby
every time we say goodbye baby
i'll always remember
