super excited today since we'll be trying muslim 
food for the first time yeah so you might be  
wondering why we're trying muscle food huge 
population of zane wanga or mindanao is munlo yeah  
so why wouldn't we try their food so we're really 
excited it's food we've never actually tried  
so we're super excited to try it and we 
heard it spicy so we can't turn that down yes
good morning and we're here at our first stop  
which is where a lot of people will 
come in the mornings and have some
special sauce you can get a mix of meats 
we got chicken we have liver and kidney  
grill which is the best yes not fried for real and 
then underneath the sausage i think there's one  
right yeah right and potatoes 
what's gonna grab you is beautiful
well i'm eating that first all right let's just 
try it i'm gonna go with what's familiar to me  
and that's the chicken
so we're going up the spice meter from
very spicy and it's not even like 
our spice it's really just not spicy
barbecue curry which is actually good by 
the way the sauce is great it's just not  
especially very expensive our driver was 
telling us that people will have saute  
in the morning because it's so spicy so as much  
as warm throughout the day i think we just 
walked in here thinking like super spicy
it's true that's all that's the only thing 
if we had no heard nothing about it there  
would have been no second thought on any of 
it is good that's all it really matters we  
were thinking we'd be coming in and walking 
out where our faces and sweat and our tongues
okay check check that box 
okay i see why people get this  
quick easy that is actually 
really good easy to eat
so not too far from the sun probably like a 10 
minute less than 10 minute walk we made our way  
over to this restaurant that is well known 
for the spicy noodle on top of the noodles  
is this fried egg and what makes it spicy 
is this delicious hot sauce or sauce  
that we're gonna pour over the noodles 
and then we'll taste it for you all right
the active taste this is one of those foods
i think it's even hotter afterwards 
it just lingers it doesn't linger
and it was this moment he realized he asked 
for spicy and got exactly what he asked for  
he's crying internally and the opportunity 
is noodle 75 pesos so it's good for two  
people which is a pretty good deal unless 
you haven't eaten all day and then one no  
get it get your own get your recipes sure 
but guys let's stop at spicy put a lot
oh i'm sweating i'm sweating
so if you're in the city center stop by here 
right and that'll be disappointing especially  
like spicy stuff if you don't have a whole 
selection of everything else for your trash so  
very very careful we're gonna finish this and then 
we're gonna go somewhere else so yeah all right  
guys so it's raining a little bit this morning 
just came out of nowhere you know what let's just  
rent a car but we're not just going to rent a car 
we're going to rent a car with a driver which is  
very rare for us however we googled it we found 
this car rental right there guys dc car rental  
we'll put the link below so you can find it but 
it's very easy to get to we can't leave zamboanga  
without trying all the tasty foods so let's go 
ahead get the ball rolling and eat our hearts out
all right guys as you can see there's no 
shortage of food on this table right now  
and we'll let you know the names of 
them as we taste a little bit of them  
but first we got this special soup that will 
happen it's actually beef cooking the charcoal  
so that's why it's the black color you've never 
had it so we're going to try it for the first time
wow i don't know what chocolate supposed to 
taste like what would i do tastes like a spice
it's the right amount of spices
the beak is so tender the broth 
is so flavorful like this is legit  
some of the best the broth alone 
is good i don't even need to be
it's a perfect amount of spice not too spicy  
just right it's just right but we all know 
what happens when we have too much charcoal
yeah in america how much is it it's expensive
oh my god
you need to close your legs 
because she's literally coming out  
you're not going to be able to have kids okay oh 
my god i'm scared to try this jiggly it's good
it's like liquid fat almost oh
oh there's a lot in here still
it like melts in your mouth it's like butter 
literally like liquid fat like it tastes  
i don't know why people fight over it yeah 
that's the first time we've ever had bone marrow  
in the u.s like that would be a fish that you 
order bone marrow already off to a good start  
make sure the watercress okay and it's like a 
curry sauce i think it's good the buttercream  
is actually good so is it great but i think i 
would like it it's more on the sweet side than  
uh spicy stuff i agree i get like a hint of peanut 
butter let's try this i'm gonna try the fish cake
however i'm a huge fan of falafels this i like 
because it tastes fresh you could talk to carriage  
that hasn't been frozen like it's like just 
hot and it's like cooked this is so far
what
it's the food i've been 
looking for in terms of spice  
like it's it's perfectly sweet we 
like spicier food this is legitimately
you probably heard us talk about how we miss spies  
and how we're always searching for 
this fight we found it we found it
no the beef was on the sweeter side  
however compared with the price it's actually 
really really good and it's spicy and actually  
that's why the spicy things yeah i agree with 
another punch we're going to try the chicken
i feel like everything we've 
had so far has been like a  
like a party in our mouth and the chicken's kind 
of like uh the cops are coming so we can't stop
we gotta go i guess after eating everything 
else which had that spice in it i expected that  
from hot sauce but but it does serve a purpose 
because when you know either group of people  
not everybody's gonna want the 
spicy foods so that's a good
here get on instagram do your thing 
we just suggested the sample platter  
try it all while you're here because that way you 
can learn and see what you like and if you like it  
order even more exactly and now that we got done 
trying the sample pattern it's time for the turks  
that was 19 of the entire platter guys that had 
four people we didn't want to share with them  
with our friends but we did all right 
guys it's like a crate all right
it's very familiar and it just realized what it 
was what is it so growing up my mom loved almond  
joy candy bars i hated them like eating them is 
that coconut taste it has the same texture to  
it you can taste it it almost has like a have 
you ever had omg no never if you know you know  
otherwise it's just very coconutty it's 
got a good like grit texture to it it's  
very good actually and the outside is so spongy 
and airy so it doesn't really feel like you should  
have any gut eating on kennedy's i don't know how 
the outside is airy what does that even mean tell  
the world what hairy means all right now we're 
gonna do the banana it's a coconut sauce all right
that sauce i don't even need the banana right 
you can eat that spoonful oh my gosh double dip
well it's just him it's mine take it away well 
why are you excited this one reminds supposedly  
at home it's like a tamale it's wrapped 
in this corn husk and once you open it up
okay the sweet corn is really good
if you guys can see huh there's 
bits of sweet corn inside
do you have any left over
this is good all right one more one more if any 
of you guys know will is an ube connoisseur over  
here it's like all and we just found out 
the coding of this snack is all too big
anyway i like this one even more  
than the crate than the other one 
the ube aftertaste is really good
we might have to get some of these to go yeah 
it looks really good that's good all right
so i walked away liking way more than we thought 
we would we have no idea about the muslim foods  
or desserts we will come back so if any 
of you are visiting someone's city and  
you're looking for some spices in life or 
just some mushroom food come here but also  
like look at the footage we're about to 
show you right look at the outdoor scenery  
it's like it's an entire mood we'll catch 
you at the next good stop there we go here  
all right guys no in singapore city is going to be 
complete without visiting this infamous out of our  
seafood restaurant this restaurant is well known 
for his karacha also known as deepsea crab garage
but they're known for the deep sea crab along 
with their all of our sauce yeah so we're  
excited to try it we've people have been raving 
about it so we need to try for ourselves we're  
here where we should be and patrick star also 
known as keystar this is wrapping by the way um  
it's exciting all right guys look at that those 
are some crabs they real good in the scene  
patrick was just honestly joe for peace star 
was not a joke but it's actually mr grabs  
patrick he's like he said 
this isn't about you please  
like let your dad have some time do you mind 
the sauce that you see above the koracha  
is the special sauce we were talking about 
earlier and we'll get a whiff of it how is it  
it smells good it has a lot of different 
smells in here so should we try that first yes
boy that's gonna be good with the crab i already 
know it it just melts in your tongue like it  
just easily goes down it's liquid so this is 
no imitation wrap we'll just put it that way  
if you've never had actual crab 
please go try it i don't care  
where from just please try natural 
crap this is a messy meal i mean
i'm just like applesauce all over me and i'm 
even mad it's not spicy but it's not sweet  
no because it's actually really right 
in the middle perfect today be prepared  
don't wear white you will get it all over here  
that's like weird enough the meat's 
really good like i'm not even exaggerating  
so i'm sure we told you guys already but willa 
and i when we first got to the philippines we were  
very adventurous to seafood and ever since we've 
been making friends here they've been like showing  
us the best places to try food yeah it's kind of 
way more comfortable with it the good thing about  
having friends that live or have lived in the 
areas you visit especially in a foreign country  
is that they are going to push you out of your 
comfort zone yeah and show you things that you  
would never try anywhere else and that's that's 
that's the best part of the entire experience  
we've had that we've been pushed out of our 
comfort zone for things he would never try
ah that's a good one
there's no shortage of meat in 
the female crabs or karachas
we have i don't even know how color our hands 
are now let's just say they're extremely messy  
it gets our silver fruit it's very very very good 
but we've eaten so much today everywhere we've  
been i think we need to call the day absolutely 
like when you find yourself in someone the city  
be sure to try out all these foods that we have 
the privilege of trying because it will throw your  
taste buds taste buds in the loop it'll be great 
especially if you're traveling in the philippines
so this has been some of the best we've 
had so we've been here actually even before  
that quite honestly this could be some of 
the best we've had period totally i agree  
so thank you for watching be sure to like
