hey you guys welcome back to the channel my name 
is Killermcnight accompanied by Queen Taylor and  
as you might know Queen Taylor is 52 weeks 
54 weeks pregnant um so we're kind of trying  
to do different things with the channel and 
this video actually came as a recommendation  
and through a conversation I had with Mike 
from regeneration Nation TV we're starting  
here with Filipino drinking etiquette I think 
that's fun I think it's fun too you ready to  
get into this I am all right I'm excited let's 
hop on over the video and let's get it started  
Cal drinking is a vital part of Philippine 
culture from the smallest birthday parties  
to Big Town fiestas Filipinos just can't seem to 
get together without having a few drinks on the  
table however believe it or not amidst the chaos 
lies an age old order welcome to Philippines 101  
and this is Philippine drinking at kid does 
he sound like he's um speaking in Australian  
abroad down down that was a terrible I'm 
so sorry now that we managed to offend
everyone following the opening of the bottle 
the tangero also called the Gunner and one of  
the distinctive characters of the drinking culture 
in the Philippines assumes an important role now  
prior to the commencement of the festivities 
a small portion of the intoxicating liquid is  
poured into the cap then subsequently emptied 
onto the ground this ceremonial offering to  
the spirits is considered essential for a safe 
and devil free s yeah I think like Americans  
have a thing it's not really something that's like 
typical or standard but you know it's like people  
sometimes at a party or like oh like pouring out 
for the homies and like just drop a little but  
it's not like a I said it's not standard and it's 
not like necessarily before you drink or anything  
but I've heard of certain Su superstitions 
Superstition Superstition superstitions that  
sounded weird superstitions I've heard of certain 
superstitions where people do things like to ward  
off evil spirits and stuff like that so that was 
really interesting and I'm glad he explained it  
cuz when I was like why is he pouring it out the 
Tango pours the drink every time measuring the  
liquor by eye the participants are not given 
individual glasses this is in accordance with  
the tradition of tag which means a show of 
trust camaraderie and in these days a United  
willingness to enter in a CO Russian Roulette 
as drink Russian Roulette common glass in a  
round robin sequence I was literally about to say 
that's how Co starts that's how starts that's how  
Co started oh that's so funny that he mentioned 
that it is frowned upon to take a past but when  
a drinker is excessively intoxicated a substitute 
from within the group must consume the sh in the  
drinker's place without affecting his or her own 
turn to maintain the sequence wow it is customary  
post consumption to return the shot glass to 
the center of the table or hand it directly to  
the tangero to be refilled for the next Drinker 
the composition of every drinking session varies  
however it is important to familiarize oneself 
with these characters has to be aware of their  
characteristics the Drunken Master a legend gifted 
with immunity from inebriation usually left with  
the task of cleaning up after all is said and 
done The Walking Dead this creature's will to  
stay conscious despite consuming overwhelming 
amount of alcohol is commendable and allows it  
to continuously engage that is me albe it 
from a half dead state The Escape Artist  
capable of sudden disappearances it leaves 
unnoticed bringing with it its share of the  
bill the werewolf the usual Catalyst of trouble 
it turns aggro and overconfident with every shot  
the concert queen or King a frustrated vocalist 
this creature bards the karaoke machine and its  
quest for validation the Sleeping Beauty with its 
low tolerance for alcohol this creature lacks the  
ability to stay conscious with its introduction in 
its bloodstream because it is immobilized early on  
in the session the Sleeping Beauty is the primary 
target for embarrassing photos and unwarranted  
facial Doodles the runner the one task with the 
acquisition and Logistics of essential supplies  
to perpetuate the drinking session such as ice 
and booze one privilege of the runner is that  
it is is able to choose the food it likes to be 
consumed by the group along with the alcohol and  
it's so funny that they broke down cuz I think 
no matter what culture you're in there's those  
people you know the werewolf which I think Mike's 
the werewolf by the way I'm wondering what do you  
guys consider yourselves down in the comments let 
us know you're definitely Sleeping Beauty yeah I  
would say out of all that it's funny because I 
was actually Anna sent me a video the other day  
she sent it to us and the girls um there's like 
four of us that are really good friends and it's  
this group of five girl friends it was on Tik 
Tok and it's like they're all out drinking and  
it's like oh which one are you and it's got like 
the one that goes to the gym after no matter what  
the one that's like the emotional one the one that 
smashes on food there's like all these different  
ones and she's like which one do you guys think 
you are so we were kind of planning that out and  
so I was laughing at that and I'm I'm definitely 
the emotional Drinker I think but yeah it's been  
almost 9 months since I've had any alcohol so 
I think at this point I definitely would be the  
sleeper for sure and I'm definitely The Walking 
Dead that like hit the nail I could drink so  
much and enough alcohol that you think I should 
be dead but I'm still awake like still ready to  
drink definitely like zombie State still drinking 
like yeah that described you to a tea yeah it was  
perfect you see for Filipinos no drinking session 
is complete without the accompaniment of food  
usually of the greasy and fatty variety is called 
buan and it comes from the filipino word bulot  
meaning to pick up so now it is acceptable for 
drinkers to grab small bites in bit delicious too  
this is to remove the bitterness from the alcohol 
as well as prolong intoxication as the food is  
hoped to slow down the alcohol from entering 
the bloodstream it is unacceptable however to  
consume the pollutant with rice as it is meant 
to be shared and not to be hoarded and treated  
like a meal in the event that grease or fat is 
unavailable inexpensive nuts and chips are usually  
the viable Alternatives including some born out of 
creative Ingenuity like the tuna and Cano cracker
combo I've seen this from French
restaurants sh up
disgusting the other thing that was really 
interesting was like the food concept MH you  
would think that like here in America you would 
think like that's a common like they set it up  
they were like we're not doing this without the 
food and it was like a part of their drinking  
experience we really don't like uh it's not 
an typical thing I'm definitely like a if I  
get drunk or am getting drunk I'm like I 
want snacks but it's not like a yeah not  
like a standard thing that's like we've got to 
incorporate this into it and then you have a  
bunch of like drunken people trying to figure 
out how to get food it's like you should have  
planned this better we should have had or derves 
or finger food like they had and it it was very  
like greasy and fatty foods and I'm like that 
is so smart that is incredibly ingenious so  
yeah help soak it up comp or compe in Japanese 
the Filipino way of saying cheese the clinking  
of glasses and the partaking of a shared 
beverage containing every participant's DNA  
is meant to honor old friendships celebrate 
new ones and in certain situations possibly  
avert oneself from being violated with a 
sharp piece of metal designed to break up
ice this was a very fun video yeah it was it 
was fun like to learn about but then he also  
like presented everything in a very fun and funny 
way as well that made it like more interesting so  
you guys let us know down in the comments how 
accurate is this by the way like Filipinos how  
like accurate would you say that this is cuz 
I always like I want to watch like things of  
America or like I'm always worried about like 
seeing like those top 10 uh most beautiful  
places in America and I'm like no they suck yeah 
you know that's the hard part about I'm really  
excited to get into some cultural type stuff 
but it's like obviously videos we're watching  
and reacting to to or things like that but 
not stuff that we have personal knowledge of  
so what to us might be like oh these are like 
the 10 most beautiful places to see you like  
wherever it's from if you're if you live there

something particular for like your group of  
people like your friends group your family group 
or say if we were to visit the Philippines and you  
know we met some locals out somewhere if they 
would be like hey come on and like we would be

inclusive to your group of people or how does  
that work yeah if that makes sense questions I 
I'm leaving this video with more questions than
