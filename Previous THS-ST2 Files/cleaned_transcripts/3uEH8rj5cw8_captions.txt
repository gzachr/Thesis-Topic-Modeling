You know, a lot of people talk about Siargao
like it's the next Bali.
There are similarities.
There's the palm trees,
there's the jungles, there's the beaches.
But, you know,
having been to both places,
I don't think these islands
are that much similar to each other.
And after spending the last
six weeks here,
I think I like Siargao
a lot more than I like Bali.
So in this video, I'm going to show you
some of the highlights of Siargao
and some of the cool things you can do.
So it's 11:30 a.m.
right now
and I'm on the very south
eastern edge of Siargao
in this neighborhood called Catangnan,
where I've been
for the last six weeks almost,
while I've been editing
all these videos from Manila.
But today, for the first time,
I'm actually going to leave this area
and try to explore
like a bit more of the island.
Before that,
I want to show you guys
my favorite part
about this neighborhood.
Hello
Hello Scoobs.
Did I wake you up?
As cute as those puppies are now,
I swear, they were like
literally a third of the size
when I came here six weeks ago.
They're so cute.
What happens when you party
for 24 hours straight.
See that?
Next to the sign.
- I own the place. Okay?
Oh, you have like 2 helmets?
Okay people,
everyone wear your helmets
because I had to save this guy
from the hospital
last time someone wasn't wearing a helmet.
- Skateboard helmets though.
I mean, that's better than nothing.
Better than a concussion.
We're going to go to the river now.
Internet says it's 30 degrees,
but it feels like 36 degrees.
Definitely feels like it.
Btw this is Roel. He’s a videographer,
makes cool videos.
So check out his Instagram too.
So right now, we're in the Masin River
in the middle of Siargao,
the iconic river with the palm trees.
And you can take a canoe ride here.
I don't know if we have time for that
because we're trying to go somewhere else,
but there is a diving platform
that we want to make the most out of.
Going for a jump, but after this cookie.
It's my turn.
That was fun.
I hit the bottom.
It's not that deep
because I went straight in, and like my foot
hit the bottom.
- You’re from YouTube right?
Yeah
- Oh my God!
(Photographer mentions pictures)
Is someone taking your picture? Okay
- Can we take a picture later?
Yeah, yeah. For sure.
Oh my god!
- You think it’s going to hold?
I don't know if it’s going to hold (our weight).
- It will, it will.
I think you’ll have to jump that way.
-Ready?
3 2 1..
- Woohoo
-I did hit the ground.
-With my back.
Yeah.
Did you do a cannon-ball last time?
-Yeah, that's better.
Yeah.
We didn't get on the boat
because we don't have a lot of time,
and we need to get to this
other really cool spot.
We left our scooter here.
And they were nice enough to cover the seat.
because it gets so hot in the sun.
So we're at these rock pools
that are supposed to be pretty cool
at low tide.
Let's see how it is.
We’re almost there.
It's like 3:30 p.m..
And honestly,
it's like so much nicer
that it's a little bit cooler
because, you know, like
it's a beautiful island, but,
you can't really enjoy it
if you're sweating all the time
and if you're hungover like I am
because I went out
yesterday like an idiot.
So we're at the wave
pools or the rock pools by the ocean
with the waves.
So when we were walking over here,
all we saw was like green algae
like this, which is not that pretty,
but the pool itself
looks really nice and blue,
and it's important
to come here at low tide.
Otherwise, if we come here at high tide,
everything's under water
and it's not that cool.
I think what's really cool here
is that these waves are coming
and crashing
right on the edge of the rock pool.
So you probably don't
want to go for a swim anywhere
past this.
Okay, 
I'm going in.
There's no way
my sandals
are going to stay on during a backflip.
Ohhh
Yeah this is probably gonna be like pretty painful.
Got some little baby scratches.
I don't even know when this happened.
That was a lot of fun.
When I did the backflip,
one of my flip flops,
like flew 20 or 30 foot away.
I don't know how that happened.
Looks like Roel
found a nice hot tub over there.
Looking sexy in the.. (laughter)
- Hello ladies.
That was pretty cool.
But now we got to head back
because we don't want
to be driving a scooter when it gets dark
because that's how accidents happen.
Okay,
so we're back in Catangnan on the beach
where we started the video.
But now I'm going to go to this surf
spot right over there,
which is like a very famous
international surf spot called Cloud9.
So that right there was Cloud9,
which is formerly like a WSL (World Surf League)
professional break.
And it's not too big today.
So those are not like the biggest waves you see there.
It can be like, double overhead, 
it can be massive over there, but not today.
So basically for the last six weeks
I've been here,
I've been like surfing a lot.
I wish I could show
you guys a video of that,
but I don't have a GoPro floatie
backdoor for my GoPro so
I don't have the balls to go out there
with the GoPro and lose it while
trying to film myself surfing.
You know it feels pretty surreal because today
is my last day in Siargao
because I'm going to
another island tomorrow
and I think I just saw my last sunset
in Siargao for a long, long time.
I don't know when I'm coming back,
but I hope to come back.
This island is so much fun.
It's a really pretty island
and everyone knows there's like a lots
of pretty islands in the Philippines.
Some would say there
probably even prettier
ones like up north in El Nido.
But there's just so much to do here.
There's like,
you can surf,
but even if you don't surf,
there's just
a good vibe about this place.
The people are so chill.
There's tons of nightlife
and stuff to do at night.
So I've been going out a lot
for the last six weeks
with friends
that I've made
over the last couple of weeks
and also the travelers
that come to Siargao are like a different..
a bit different
from like your average
Southeast Asian backpacker.
It's like more slow
travelers, people taking it easy.
There have been a lot of people
that I've known that have been here
for like six weeks,
the same time as I have been
and are all like leaving soon as well.
I go out here
and I don't just go out
with like other backpackers,
which is
often what I find myself
doing in a lot of other Asian countries.
I go out here with the locals,
like I've become really good friends
with a lot of the locals
and we all go out together
and it's just like such a good vibe.
Here's like a glimpse of the nightlife
of Siargao for like everything else
that happens
when the cameras are not rolling.
It's a fun place.
