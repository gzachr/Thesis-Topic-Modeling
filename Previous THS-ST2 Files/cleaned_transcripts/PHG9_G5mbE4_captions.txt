Hi, friends welcome back to my channel my name 
is Amit and you're watching Indian Reacts. Today  
we are going to react to an interesting video 
and the title of the video is Mumbai vs manila  
we already compared many videos of Mumbai with 
Jakarta and Mumbai with Kuala Lumpur now it's  
time to compare Mumbai with Manila if you all 
know manila is the capital city of Philippines  
and Mumbai is the economical capital of India  
so without wasting much of the time we are going 
to start this video but before that as always  
I am going to thank few of my subscribers who 
are continuously supporting me so thank you all  
this video is provided by the ASEAN section I'll 
provide the link in the description you can go  
and watch more about it so without 
wasting much of the time let's start
Mumbai vs Manila Philippines and India
the Asian section
okay so start with Mumbai India wow nice 
Mumbai is the economical capital and its GDP is  
1.2 billion dollars so it's a very rich country 
it's a very rich place for it this is the marine  
beach and that is one cadet stadium that 
you are able to see this is Mumbai Bandra
MAIDAN

this is one of the famous 
temples in Mumbai of lord Ganesha  
these are the slums of Mumbai this is 
SHIVSENA BHAVAN more in news nowadays
wow see the latest updates of Mumbai  
the highways and the expressway they just fly 
over this is our very famous flyover of Mumbai  
drone shots are quite beautiful if we 
have a night view then it's very awesome
that is a stadium that one of the famous stadiums
that is  
Bollywood is from Mumbai so if you ever 
watched a movie that is from India in  
Hindi language then it's a Bollywood movie 
now the night views wow see the beachside
early morning
the video quality is not that good but it's very 
awesome to watch this is a gate of INDIA a temple
nice
so this is Mumbai and it's very awesome 
now I think yeah we are going to manila  
The Philippines the capital of 
The Philippines so let's watch
nice
which tower is this let me know in the 
comment section so I can know about this more
nice okay
great green yeah manila is also looking like a 
city in India that stadium surpassed skyscrapers  
I think there are fewer skyscrapers as compared 
to Mumbai in manila but it's beautiful there are  
so many churches here because Christianity 
is the main religion that we have in manila
wow this park is awesome what a view
these roads are like GTA Vice city 
if you ever played that game nice
go cool
this is a mall
wow what is this is some 
five-star property or what is this
still in construction manila is 
looking a little clean as compared to  
Mumbai oh nice PRIYANKA Chopra is there
that is some cinema hall a 
movie theater very nice glow wow
the video of manila is quite clean wow 
very awesome night how they decorate their  
buildings the trump tower so the trump tower 
's actually okay this is the end of this video  
I was talking about going and subscribing to this 
channel comment subscribe to my channel also I was  
talking about the trump tower so trump tower is 
from the former president of america donald trump  
he's a very one of the very big businessman 
in this sector so they have many residents in  
building a different part of the world so trump 
towers are managed by donald trump and his wife  
only okay coming to our video my views are 
like mumbai is more uh developed as compared  
to manila but manila is more clean so there are 
good skyscrapers in mumbai but the sky scrappers  
of manila are looking more beautiful because 
they decorate it they maintain it very well and  
yeah most of the manila and most of Mumbai are 
similar so that's why I always used to say like  
The Philippines basically manila is looking more like 
of my home towns like Mumbai like Delhi in India  
and that's why there is not much difference the 
difference is the way of living the languages and  
the standard of people that we have but both are 
very awesome countries and both have very awesome  
cities uh okay so i think uh this is from my side 
to this video let me know uh some other videos you  
want me to react on i have also reacted to one 
of the video of philippines versus indonesia  
i have also reacted versus manila so there are a 
lot many videos coming forward for philippines so
