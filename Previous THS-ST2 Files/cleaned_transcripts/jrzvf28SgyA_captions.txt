Hey, Everybody.
I am in El Nido, Palawan in the Philippines
One of the most beautiful places in the world
We have some sun today
Going to some of these beautiful islands with the limestone karsts
and the clear blue water
Really excited. Let's go check it out
Island hopping is one of the top things to do in El Nido
because there are dozens of islands in the immediate area
And it is the best way to see the scenic spots around Palawan
which has been repeatedly crowned
The World's Most Beautiful Island
You can choose from several different tours that all go to different islands
So we've stopped at this cliff face
and there's apparently a beach that's behind this big old wall here
I'm excited to check this out
Right now, we're at our lunch spot
I can't remember a time where I had a view this good for lunch
The water here looks amazing for snorkeling
I think there's a dropoff, like in Finding Nemo
I don't know. I'm gonna go check it out
I'm gonna go touch the butt
NEMO!!!
Nemo, ahahaha... I don't get it
They're cooking food on the boat for us
Food boat delivery
salsa boats
One of the coolest things we did was visit Secret Beach
where we had to swim through a hole in the rock wall to get to it
Wow. Just WOW
We're at our last stop for the day. Time to go snorkeling
Hopefully this is even better than the last one
Looks like rain's coming
Emma, what'd you think?
It was awesome
How was it?
S*** was dooope
Dope
