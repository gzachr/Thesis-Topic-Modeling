Jack tour and I'm currently traveling around the

best tips and tricks to how to travel as well  
as taking you on my Adventures so you can be 
right beside me and experience the fun times  
we have together okay so today's video is the 
top 10 things to do and visit when you go to  
the Philippines so I just spent one whole month 
in the Philippines I literally extended my Visa  
out to the very last day I left on my passport 
because I loved it that much there is so much  
to do in the Philippines and we're going to 
dive deep into that so yeah strap yourselves  
in for this one grab a beer grab a tea because 
we're about to dive deep into some knowledge  
about the Philippines and just have a whole 
lot of fun where I can run you guys through  
what to expect and most importantly what to 
do when you're here in the Philippines so as  
you may tell this will be my last video for 
the Philippines my next video I'll be flying  
from Manila all the way to Osaka Japan so I'm 
super excited to show you guys Japan and show  
you everything around there but there's one 
disclaimer I just want to mention before I  
move on with the rest of the video now there is a 
little bit of talk in the vlogger world the travel  
vlogging world that Filipinos subscribe to your 
channel but when you leave the Philippines they  
don't watch and I was thinking Hmm it sort of 
does make sense because I have seen it before  
but I reckon the Filipinos who have subscribed 
to my channel are pretty loyal people I see you  
guys all in the comments and liking the videos so 
I was thinking I want to challenge you guys don't  
be like the rest and continue to watch my next 
travel Series in Japan and as well you can go to  
Japan you do have a passport you if you don't you 
can get a passport or if you can't afford it live  
your travels through me and come to Japan with me 
so yeah I just want to say please stick around if  
you're from the Philippines so the Philippines why 
should you go well the Philippines is made up of 7  
000 plus islands with one of the fastest growing 
populations there is a lot to see and do with  
Crystal Clear Blue Waters blue lagoons white sandy 
beaches coconut trees relaxation and lovely people  
that I might add speak very good English so it's 
a dream travel destination it is definitely a must  
to come to the Philippines so let's dive deep 
now with number one of what you should do when  
you arrive in the Philippines well chances are 
you're going to be arriving in Manila Manila is  
the biggest and capital city of the Philippines 
and when you get there you will be thinking Hmm  
how do I best spend my time here I you maybe 
have two or three days in Manila before you go  
to the next Island so here's my tips for Manila so 
I recommend going to Fort San Diego this fort is a  
amazing built up fort with a lot of deep history 
I believe it's only 100 pesos to enter which is  
about two dollars so it's definitely worth it I 
would definitely go in the morning before the heat  
structure and as well it's actually quite quiet 
in the morning so if you go around 9 or 10 a.m you  
should be beating the crowds and the tour buses 
that end up there at around lunchtime or in the  
afternoon explore around Fort Santiago I won't 
get too much into detail of the history of the  
place I won't spoil that for you or if you want 
it spoiled I'll leave the video where I went there  
up here up next I would be going to to Manila 
Cathedral this is our amazing old Cathedral Church  
built in the 1500s go in there and experience 
the peace and tranquility and view all of the  
amazing old architecture also there's a hot tip 
there's a cafe that does the best milkshakes and  
iced coffee right next to that so if you're in 
the hot sun that's a good place to escape it's  
also air conditioned as well which is quite nice 
and next to there there's a park as well which you  
can chill out after you've done a little bit of 
exploring next up I recommend going to razel park  
this is one of the main parks in Manila and it is 
lovely free to enter walk around you can grab an  
ice cream you can go and check out the Chinese 
Garden and you can also look at the memorial  
of the guards as well so yeah it's a really 
nice place full of information full of History  
definitely check out razel Park so if you arrive 
on Friday that's your Saturday done but on Sunday  
you might sort of want to get some food experience 
some more local Vibes maybe try out a market so  
that's when Lynn gaspi Sunday market comes in 
this market is a great local market with selling  
local handmade knickknacks it sells food and sells 
lechon which is like a roasted pig on a spit it is  
amazing you should definitely try that also a lot 
of Filipino desserts and other things as well by  
the way everything I mentioned in this video will 
be linked in the description all in order all set  
out nicely so you could pretty much copy and paste 
this and make this your itinerary for when you go  
to the Philippines that afternoon or maybe even on 
the Monday you can go to Venice Grand Canal Mall  
oh my gosh this mall is amazing they're pretty 
much built it on the idea of Venice it has a blue  
canal running through it with a lot of high-end 
shopping malls and also your local western Comfort  
Foods so if you're missing home already you can 
have your TGI Fridays or your Guzman Gomez or
or American barbecue or something like that 
because it has everything you need and it's  
also a really cool place to take some selfies and 
beans who doesn't want to be in Venice right radio  
so your time's up in Manila and you're ready 
to go to your first island in the Philippines  
so you're thinking where should I go first Cebu 
Bohol boracaya well I recommend you go to Quran  
this is probably the first island that makes 
sense to go to First Quran is a amazing Place  
filled with things to do but there's not as many 
tourists as you would expect that's why Corona  
is first on my list because you can dive into the 
Filipino culture talk to locals do fun activities  
but not be crowded with other Western tourists 
there will be other Filipino tourists there but  
hey sometimes you just want to get away from 
your own kind and Quran is the best place to  
do that so what do I recommend for right well 
if you want a really nice place to stay with a  
affordable room and quite a big room I might 
add then I recommend you should go to coron  
Gateway Hotel Suites this is where we stayed at 
we got a massive room for 15 US dollars each per  
night which came with a massive jacuzzi tub so 
I definitely recommend checking out them so on  
your first day what you want to do is maybe rent 
a motorbike or even get a taxi tricycle and go to  
these two places the hot springs and Cabo Beach 
so the hot springs is a great place to relax it's  
a natural Hot Springs with different hot spring 
baths and you'll see me here for the next hour  
saltwater Hot Springs extremely hot so make sure 
you've got no sunburn otherwise you'll start to  
peel and yeah just relax in the hot springs you 
can buy a nice cold drink and you can be there for  
as long as you want so that's 200 pesos to enter 
but that covers you for the whole day and yeah you  
can really relax and just chill out at the hot 
springs after that I recommend taking the taxi  
or your motorbike about 20 minutes off the road 
to Cabo Beach when we went there we had the whole  
Beach to ourselves and it was just amazing they 
have little bamboo Bungalows and huts on the side  
and they also have a lady there selling snacks now 
this was just 50 pesos to enter which is about a  
little bit over one dollar to enter and yeah it is 
definitely worth it as we were leaving there were  
people showing up but I think chances are when you 
go you'll probably be the only ones to yourself  
because you actually have to drive through a local 
Village to get to it so it's a really cool it's  
experience getting there radio so it's day two 
on Quran I recommend you should be island hopping  
the best way to do this is going to the local tour 
agencies around the island and just booking here's  
the one that we used and they were great and they 
also gave us a really good price so I recommend  
checking those guys out but once you get on a tour 
there's a few different tools you can do to a to  
a b and there's also a shipwreck tour as well we 
went on the Shipwreck tour because we're also able  
to see these shipwrecks but also Islands as well 
and we did snorkeling so it's a win-win you sort  
of got a little bit of everything which I reckon 
is the best way best bang for your buck I think if  
you do tour A or B they're quite similar the first 
thing we did is we went snorkeling in this amazing  
coral reef with all of these rainbow fish the 
water was so clear and we were the only ones there  
that's the thing I love about Quran is there's 
very few tourists Wayne less boats the only other  
boat that was with us was actually a scuba diving 
boat not even a tourism boat so yeah really cool  
and then we went to pass Island where we were the 
only ones there normally that island is extremely  
busy but guys if you go now there's not that many 
people there so I recommend booking your tickets  
to the Philippines soon before it goes busy again 
so that was number three with the island hopping  
in Quran in the Palawan sleep better anytime 
anywhere with meant to sleep thank you man to  
sleep for partnering up with my video when men 
asleep reached out to me I thought it would only  
make sense to do a sponsorship with them as I've 
been using their product for the past two months  
it has been a game changer for me their masks 
are 100 blackout for a deeper sleep don't you  
just hate it when you get a sleep mask and they 
don't even black out the light like what's even  
the point well the Mana slate mask does adjust 
that and blacks out all light they are also zero  
pressure as well and very soft on the eyelids and 
very spacious my favorite though is the Manta cool  
mask which comes in a separate pack which you 
can add on to your manta sleep mask via Velcro  
this allows you to keep cool and calm in humid 
environments for example on a non-air-conditioned  
train for all you budget Travelers out there thank 
you man to sleep for sponsoring this video so that  
brings me to number four which is El Nido El 
Nido is undoubtedly one of the most amazing  
and popular tourist spots in the Philippines with 
amazing white sand beaches turquoise Waters and a  
whole lot of fun this place is practically Built 
For Tourists and it is a great place to be for  
at least five days they have amazing restaurants 
they're very also into the hippie and like vegan  
and sort of Health Vibes as well so you can go to 
a lot of Health shops a lot of vegan places a lot  
of surf stores it's a little bit like barley to be 
honest it sort of has that Vibe now you might be  
thinking great more island hopping in El Nido well 
in actual fact I I didn't actually do it because  
when I went there was thousands of boats in the 
main Port of El Nido and I thought no I don't want  
to Island hop and pay all that money with everyone 
else so I thought what does El Nido itself have  
to offer so we did a few things while we're in 
El Nido and there's a lot of things you can do  
rather than just island hopping number one is the 
canopy walk this is a great walk that goes all the  
way to the top so you can see all over El Nido 
it's really amazing and I definitely recommend  
checking that one out as well we went to a lot of 
different beaches on the island we explored sat  
under some coconut trees just relaxed because if 
you're on holiday you should relax every now and  
then it shouldn't always be go go and rush rush 
rush you have to relax when you're on holiday it's  
and as well I recommend checking out the shopping 
in El Nido it's great there's a lot of vendors  
selling different things shirts slides flip-flops 
backpacks anything that you need they have in El  
Nido and it's actually reasonably priced I 
definitely recommend finally a restaurant in  
El Nido that I recommend is bundington seafood 
restaurant here I got garlic prawns on the beach  
and they were to die for I ate that with some 
rice and sunk down a red horse beer which by  
the way you have to try out the red horse beer 
quite strong but pretty good so yeah I ate that  
and that was beautiful they also had crab there 
as well so it's a great place and I recommend  
checking out so number five so you've done El 
Nido where to next some people would either fly  
from the El Nido airport to Boracay or get ferry 
to Boracay now we opted not to go to Boracay why  
you might think well we actually decided to 
go to Cebu instead after going to two Sandy  
Tropical Islands we thought if we go to Boracay 
that's another white sandy beach Island it is  
great but let's try and experience a little bit 
more of the Philippines so we decided to go to  
Cebu radio so because you're in Cebu City Cebu 
isn't really famous for its surrounding beaches  
but what they are famous for is their historical 
landmarks and waterfalls so that's what you should  
be doing when you go to Cebu so first I recommend 
checking out some of their churches in the city  
center there hasn't been a place where I've 
seen statues of this detail as these churches  
have a lot of history behind them so I recommend 
going there reading the parks spending your time  
walking through and just experiencing the churches 
there it has a lot of history to offer they also  
have another Fort called Fort San Pedro which is a 
great Fort as well it's a lot more maintained and  
a lot more intact than Fort Santiago and it's in a 
lovely Park area as well also have a extremely old  
ancestral house which is one of the oldest houses 
in the Philippines not gonna lie it's a little  
bit creepy but it's definitely worth checking 
out the entry fee for that is only 100 pesos  
which is just over two dollars so on your second 
or third day in Cebu City I recommend checking  
out the talonist temple this is a peaceful and 
amazing Temple to go to with Rich colors and  
really nice architecture however the employees 
there aren't the most friendly but if you can  
get by that and wear your mask because they 
require you to even wear your mask outside don't  
get me started on that but anyway that's their 
rules so walk around with your mask on try not  
to take photos in the shrine because they won't 
let they won't allow you to do that but photos  
of the building and photos of the city you can 
do and yeah it's really good it's free to enter  
um not that far out from the city and yeah it's 
a pretty nice experience if you can get over the  
rude I'll say rude the rude stuff there so yeah 
once you finish that though I recommend going to  
Tops This is a place probably half an hour from 
the taiwanus temple on a motorbike and you can  
go all the way up to Tops and see a massive view 
of the city you pretty much can see the whole city  
from there and there they have a lovely restaurant 
with some reasonably priced food as well a little  
bit more expensive than your straight food but 
hey that's fine to pay with the view that you get  
from there definitely recommend checking out tops 
after that another half an hour drive to little  
Amsterdam Garden where you can get some amazing 
Instagram photos in the hands of God and also  
walk around the garden it's a little bit touristy 
but once you can get past that it is a great place  
to be and it's pretty fun as well if you have kids 
great place to take the kids finally on that day I  
recommend spending another 20 minute drive going 
back into the City and on the way back you should  
stop at Berlin Falls this is a great place to get 
your waterfall fix now most people would say Jack  
why don't you go to the main Falls well I'll get 
to that in a second so these Falls are great they  
have about four different levels and they have a 
guide as well that you can get for 200 pesos which  
is about five dollars and the guide will take you 
all through the village make sure you're going the  
right way and look after you while you're at the 
waterfall make sure you don't drown and once and  
once you're done he'll walk you back so next up 
the following day I recommend going south of the  
island in Cebu and going cantoneering I didn't do 
this myself but fellow YouTubers Owen and Ashland  
did that and I'll put up some of their footage 
now as you can see it is a amazing Vibe jumping  
off waterfalls into the blue crystal clear 
water it is great unfortunately I didn't get  
enough time to go myself but I reached out to 
these guys and said hey can I use your footage  
and they said sure thing if you guys remember I 
actually linked up with these guys in Malaysia  
so check out their Channel if you want to see 
more travel videos so because you're already  
South you may as well head down to oslob there 
you can swim with whale sharks how cool is that  
so my friends also swam with whale sharks you get 
a paddle boat out not that far from the shore and  
you can swim with whale sharks and by the looks 
of it it is an amazing experience so I definitely  
recommend checking out that as well if you're 
in Cebu and if you have the time so from Cebu  
I recommend getting a three hour ferry ride 
all the way to bowhole Bohol is a lovely place  
and known for its Chocolate Hills and a little 
alien looking monkey called the tarzier both of  
these attractions are what make Bohol famous but 
there's also a few more things that make Bohol  
really special and that would be the hinanodon 
cave this is a blue water underground cave  
where you can come in go through a cave and 
experience a amazing Blue Water Lagoon so Bohol  
offers a range of really nice restaurants 
and hotels the area I recommend staying in  
is actually right near the airport in the Hang 
Lego part of the island there I stayed in hotel  
Sebastian this was a lovely place not sponsored 
by the way I just really like the hotel for the  
money that I paid for massive room nice shower you 
couldn't ask for more it's very Central so yeah I  
recommend staying that area of the island it gives 
you the best way to rent motorbikes get a massage  
go to the beach and just organize everything from 
that area there's also a lot of other Travelers  
in that area so you can meet up and make some 
friends while you're there as well so finally  
number 10 is davo City I'm probably saying that 
wrong people say it a few different ways but  
davo city is the second biggest city in the whole 
country of the Philippines and it is a great place  
to end your trip sort some things out if you're 
going to another country it's also great for  
digital Nomads as well so if you're like myself 
and you work online or you work on the computer  
Dave O is a really good place to just sit down 
do some work there's also really good Wi-Fi and  
it's less busy than Manila and the food it's a lot 
cheaper than Manila as well so davo City there's  
obviously some activities you can do there as well 
that's a great place to end your trip you can fly  
out there to your next country or you fly back to 
Manila and fly to your next country from there but  
I do have two more bonus tips for you guys because 
we are all about bonus tips on this channel giving  
you guys the best information so what are your 
bonus tips number one is to try Jollibee Jollibee  
is super famous in the Philippines and it is 
a interesting fast food it's mixed between  
McDonald's or KFC but you couldn't even compare 
it to them it's famous for its succulent chicken  
joy and also the Jollibee spaghetti if you go to 
some fancier restaurants they actually have Jolly  
Bots which is a robot that delivers you food so 
definitely go and check out Jolly B it's a must  
when you're in the Philippines my advice number 
two is if you go into any supermarkets to buy  
some water buy some snacks make sure that you 
break up your big notes your big bills even if  
they say do you have smaller money just say no 
hide it in a different part of your wallet and  
give them the big bills now that might sound a 
little bit mean but when you're buying straight  
food or paying a taxi driver most of the time they 
don't have change and it is a massive problem in  
the Philippines and remember if you're Filipino 
please watch in my next series in Japan don't just  
unsubscribe don't just not watch because guys 
please prove that other travel Vlog is wrong I  
know you're gonna stick around so please stick 
her out guys as always guys keep it real cheers
