[Music] hey friends Mike and Jess here and welcome 
to Regeneration TV and we are continuing with  
something this is another one from the request 
from our last video which is a Filipino drinking  
etiquette 101. this is Filipino Teen Speaks 18 
languages I'm very excited thank you for all  
the positive reception on that video we were 
a little nervous about we were in a different  
type of content but you guys seem to really 
enjoy it my mom called me up she's like that  
was freaking hilarious please do more stuff 
like that we want to do more stuff like that  
was so enjoyable and we love touching and getting 
into different cultures from all around the world  
seeing what other people are doing seeing what 
other people like and just trying new things  
yeah I've lived in Florida my whole life okay 
I have never seen snow I'm very not cultured  
okay so I need your help to be more cultured 
yes and diversified and much appreciated yeah  
and I don't know if we can afford to get out of 
the country anytime soon so this is also another  
little outlet for us somebody did say like just 
come to the Philippines already what the heck  
are you waiting for we would love to do that but 
I will in the meantime we're gonna have to do to  
make do with this getting out of debt first is 
the first priority but you know college debt is  
ridiculous over here okay I know you've heard 
nightmares horror stories about it okay maybe  
one of you should react to the nightmarish uh 
tale of college debt in America nobody wants to  
see that nobody wants to see it it's literally 
a horror movie anyways this is going to be fun  
Filipino Teen Speaks 18 languages what I don't 
know what to expect me either let's get into it
laughs
I'm Marlon and I'm 18 and I'm today 
I'm going to speak in 18 languages  
he has a language for every year that 
he was born that is impressive Tagalog
uh
that's insane though he speaks so 
well as well like I just wonder  
what language your thoughts are in 
at this point you know you could  
just go and just flow it all together 
what language do you think in yeah
the age of six I was taught the English language 
it is a second language of the Philippines and so  
we were taught English the English language here 
in the Philippines in like in the first grade and  
up to college I think so that is why I think 
English is a language that I most comfortable  
speaking with because you know I've studied a 
lot of years I'm fluent in it and I could speak  
with any English speaker in the world learning 
languages wasn't in my mind and it's like it's  
the last thing I could do but at the age of 12 I 
knew I wasn't considered with only two languages  
that's pretty crazy Spanish as well man I 
wonder what led him down this road to learn  
all of these languages at 12 he was not 
content with only speaking two languages  
and that's beautiful he decided on his own that 
he's gonna I need to speak more languages these  
subtitles are auto-generated it looks like 
so they're not going to be like perfect okay  
not going to be perfect but we'll be able 
to get the gist yeah of what he's saying
[Music] um
yeah let's just turn these off this is opening 
it for me I'm like it's Rihanna what I just wanna  
cheese gosh what is YouTube doing yeah
a difference
did he just say he learned over the internet  
I I heard the internet I don't know what he 
said but that's insane if he said that similar
Filipino language is similar to Espanol 
a little bit that's what I heard  
that's what you heard at the end that's what I 
heard you don't know I heard what I heard okay  
let me know if I heard right okay the Filipino 
language is similar to the the Spanish language  
I mean honestly a lot of these languages could 
vimilar because it's like once you I feel like  
once you learn you learn it's kind of like 
they're not all like similar they're not  
like all similar words but I mean especially 
Italian French and Spanish they were talk  
they were taught to us in school like their 
similarities in their words but I don't know  
I don't know I don't know what I mean back in a 
few hundred years ago these different countries  
that were well established went and conquered 
and settled like all over the world and like  
forced their belief systems and their languages 
on other cultures so it wouldn't be surprised  
like surprising for me to learn that there's a 
lot of mixture between the languages like that
what in the world it sounded again like it 
was there's some similarities yeah definitely  
between the languages I heard some words like I 
kind of want to play a game with myself to see  
if I can tell if there's any words I don't 
know any of these languages languages guys  
we need to this is so inspiring this is 
so inspiring that is amazing man Italian
he said he learned it on Facebook 
I'm pretty sure I heard Facebook  
if any I'm not trying to be offensive I promise 
I'm just joking yeah I'm in a bit of a jovial  
mood this evening as well so I'm not trying 
to offend if I offend anybody I apologize just  
joking but I swear he did say I learned it on 
Facebook because you know Italian hello France
and he's doing all this with like sitting 
in a bathtub with a shower curtain behind  
him you don't know that and I heard um 
a rooster I did I wonder if he lives New  
Roland okay we just got done listening 
to Roland yeah you are the reason and  
his chickens were trying to sing with him 
it was beautiful it was awesome beautiful
that's crazy man I watched UFC for a very long 
time they have a lot of international Fighters  
and I will watch like pre-fight post-fight press 
conferences and a lot of them you know they they  
just speak their native language and you have 
to get The Interpreter to interpret it so I've  
I've heard people speak all of these languages 
and his his dialect seems to be so perfect like  
his pronunciation of the words like it seems so 
well it seems so good it's still I yeah as soon as  
he's speaking it it's like you close your eyes and 
you're like somebody who's from that that speaking  
that language comfortably all the 
time is speaking to you like what  
German oh this reminds me Brothers yeah Jess's 
brother actually speaks German yeah I wish she  
was here right now he could tell us how well 
he he speaks it yeah he could tell us that and  
tell us what he's saying I I'm freaked out if 
you have a deep voice and you uh speak German  
I'm freaked out okay it's like watching a horror 
movie it does it does come off very aggressive  
It's a Spooky language yeah especially 
the deeper your voice it is spooky dude is
the lighter your voice the more I'm okay with it 
okay your brother has a bit of a deep voice yeah  
he does and but and some German guys they have 
such deep voices I know you guys know what I'm  
talking about if you hear a very deep voiced guy 
talking German I'm out of there you not you'll  
look around and look for me I'm gone okay hiding 
under her blanket shaking make it stop angles
and you can express more fluent it was the 
weirdest one so far the way that they enunciate  
some words like what in the heck that is crazy 
this is so impressive what did that say Africans
I did not know that was a language that's crazy 
I yeah I haven't heard of that now Afrikaans  
it's my lifting
that is crazy Esperanto I haven't 
heard of that these are we're  
getting into languages that I didn't 
even know existed now this is insane
this is crazy because he's not just saying 
like words just like random words like yeah  
he's speaking to you literally having like 
the conversation he's talking about that  
specific language maybe but he's literally having 
sentences it sounds like he's explaining why or  
how he learned it yeah and what the differences 
are like he's singing or saying this is so crazy  
and so mind-blowing and so inspirational so 
cool what now we're on the Indonesian Gracia
what okay so question for people who are 
multilingual does the because I learned Spanish  
in French but I literally didn't take advantage 
of it in high school I just was like there to  
get the grade and get out of there but like when 
you learn a language is it easier to understand  
it after you learn it or is it easier to learn 
it after you understand it like when somebody  
speaks to you if you can understand what they're 
saying is it easier to learn it after that or is  
it easier to learn it once you've already learned 
the language I've always been curious about that  
or maybe it's different for different people 
but I don't understand the question maybe I'm  
just not meant for being multilingual but 
like so when when you're speaking another  
language to me if I can understand every word 
you're saying before I even know how to speak  
the language back to you would that make it easy 
accessible you can still like learn I don't know  
maybe maybe it's not possible I don't know but 
I'm just like saying like yeah see my brain is  
too small for that question maybe it was a dumb 
question you never know maybe the question was to  
super dumb and now your brain can't process 
it because it's a dumb question I really am  
curious and I would like to know what you guys 
think I try to take Spanish in high school  
they just kicked me out of the classroom like 
sir your tongue it's not shaped correctly you  
could just leave now about Spanish classes I'm 
not gonna try it my tongue she's very adamant  
about my tongue gets swollen when I try just 
it gets beat up in my mouth for some reason
dude I'm so ooh Russian I like it is
dude he can go everywhere he wants in the world 
so that's awesome our friend Adina is from Romania  
is uh and she's a twin which is 
beautiful I like that foreign
how many is this so far I don't know I got 
lost after like three are you kidding me  
oh my goodness I'm just mind-blown 
by all this this kid is incredible
foreign
I want to see a video where he like 
went around to all of these countries  
and just randomly walks up to somebody 
and starts switching between languages  
or something be so fun their faces 
would probably be like Philippines
okay his brain's starting to freeze up 
I'm just kidding dude that sounds like  
the hardest language ever are you kidding me is 
insane I can't that's insane I can't wait what  
did that say I it went to is it a Filipino right 
a Philippine language Philippine yeah yes okay
together
[Music]
so thanks for watching I hope I have said 
the right words and if I have made mistakes  
I'm sorry I'm not really fluent in all of them so 
that's it's just a practice so thank you very much  
thank you thank you that is awesome I've said this 
multiple times in our videos because we will have  
people who will take the time to write in English 
even though it's not their first language and at  
the end they always say I'm sorry my English 
isn't that good and I'm just like you should  
not apologize no that is incredible you should be 
so proud of yourself on our Channel just know you  
don't ever have to apologize for anything like 
that no we are like humbled by your incredible  
talent to be multi-lingual yeah you should be 
so proud of that I I want to be I want to have  
at least bilingual I at least want to learn one 
other language besides English but I just think  
it's so cool and so amazing that you take the 
time to to to like hone those skills yeah of all  
the skills that you can learn in this world like 
I know how to do a few things really well but to  
learn a completely different language and then 
you learn another one and then another one and  
then another one another one another one another 
one another way all the way to 18. who cares if  
you're fluent in all of them why you are freaking 
doing a great job yeah that is amazing that is  
unbelievable that blows my mind because not only 
that like they have all different kinds of like  
styles to save them like I oh my gosh my brain 
would just go I would just be melting I don't know  
because I would try so hard I would think 
about it first of all the overthinking would  
just get me and I'd freeze and everything that 
I was saying but like that was so impressive I  
can't oh that was awesome I've asked I used to 
work a lot of construction and I worked with  
a lot of Spanish speaking people and I was 
just like okay you speak English really well  
what do you thinking what thoughts what are your 
thoughts in you're like well it depends sometimes  
it's easier to think in English sometimes it's 
easier to speak uh to to think in in Spanish it  
depends on the phrase because I guess some 
phrases are like just easier to get out in  
English some are easier to get out in Spanish 
or whatever language you speak so it's just  
like once you learn so many and you do become 
fluent in them like what language do you think  
it's just it's always been a question that I've 
had it on I never even thought to think like that  
question that's an interesting question though 
for sure because it's like thinking is such a  
instantaneous thing so you look over there at 
something you're like oh a red shirt yeah or  
oh this movie trailer's on oh this thing it's 
just like some things like how does that work  
I don't even know my mind is just boggled by this 
whole entire thing yeah now I'm even more confused
