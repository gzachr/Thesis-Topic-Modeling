hi guys welcome to another episode of pinay mom's blogs we are on our way to pick up
our kids from school after which we'll
go straight to the central train
station in Amsterdam and head to
Brussels in Belgium why because we are
taking the Eurostar train to go to london
oh my god it just started to rain but
I'm here to pick up the kids and then
we're gonna go let's see hi Liam are you
ready to go to London yes
hi i'm looking outside like that
welcome to the adventure london (oh my god) yeah the unscheduled train unscheduled train
here it is Liam go sit down my love
So we are here in amsterdam going to brussels but our brussels train cancelled... so we had to improvise (with high speed train) and take another kind of train
ok so guys we are here we are actually sitting next to the exits and the reason why we are sitting here is because this isn't our train
to brussels what actually happened was the brussels train cancelled and so thankfully another train thalys train was able to take us
we had to pay extra of course but atleast we get to brussels on time for our next train ride to london
in order to get to london from amsterdam
there is a quick change onto a direct
Eurostar train from Brussels to London
st. Pancras International and that's
just for about two hours
So guys we are now here in the eurostar
and thankfully we were able to make it
it was such a stressful travel but
thank god we made it hopefully we'll make it on time in london see you there
because Great Britain is not included in
the Schengen area we had to first go
through check-in at the channel terminal
and then we had our identities checked
by both the Belgian and British
authorities and of course they also
checked our luggage the travel by
Eurostar is about three hundred
kilometres per hour through the English
Channel and for a duration of about an
hour forty minutes the travel is quite
smooth actually with comfortable seats
there's an extendable table for a group
of four and they offer a play area on
assigned cabins plus an onboard bar
buffet so you can get something to drink
or eat while you're en route
Hi so we are finally here in london (cheering)
we thought we wouldn't make it on
schedule but thankfully were able
to we had to pay a little bit extra though because
completely full on the other train that we needed to take but finally we're here in london
because we are going to use the public
transport here in London we decided to
use and purchase an oyster card the
Oyster card is a reusable electronic
ticket that is sort of like a credit
card which is topped up from time to
time by the owner with cash and it's used to pay public fares
and once we purchased the oyster cards
that we needed during our stay it was
time to take the tube to our destination
hi guys we finally arrived at our
destination we're so tired we've rented
via Airbnb and we are very happy so far
with our choice of stay we'll see you
again on our next episode of pinay mom's blogs ok? Good night!
