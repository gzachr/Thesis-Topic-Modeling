It's "ber months" already.
Time pass by so fast.
And by the way, advance
Merry Christmas to all of you.
Because as you know, Christmas
starts in the Philippines on September.
As for me, I can already feel
the cool breeze, how about you?
Can you feel it? It slowly feels cold.
In this times, it's good to sip warm soup.
And of course, it's not
just a normal warm soup.
It should be delicious and filling.
That's why I'll start sharing easy to
cook and easy to prepare soup dishes.
That you can easily do in your home.
Like our featured recipe for today,
this is called misua with meatballs.
Or mostly known as Almondigas.
And here are the ingredients
we'll use for our recipe.
Here's the ground pork,
you can use ground chicken,
here's the misua or flower noodles,
here's the patola,
it's so long.
But we'll only use half or less than
half of it because it's a bit too long.
I'll peel it later. The
challenge is in peeling it.
Here's the green onion stalks,
this is an optional ingredient.
I'll use beef broth or beef stock.
But if you don't have this
available, even water works.
Just a add a piece of
pork cube or beef cube.
Here's the onion that I
chopped in small pieces.
All-purpose flour,
garlic, we'll also need a piece of egg,
here's the ground black pepper,
salt and cooking oil.
And here is the list of ingredients
that we'll use for this recipe.
So if you're ready, let's go and start.
The first thing we'll do is the meatballs.
As for the meatballs, it's really easy.
So I have here a ground
pork, just like what I said earlier,
ground chicken or ground beef is okay too.
Not everyone eats pork.
After that, we'll add, this,
half of the onions.
The other half we'll use
it for sauteing. After that,
we'll use the egg, so
a just a piece of egg,
and here's the all-purpose flour,
so the flour and also the
egg will act as the binder.
So that the pork and
onion won't get separated.
I'll season it with ground black pepper.
What we're doing is really simple,
we're just mixing all of the ingredients.
And salt, to give the meatballs flavor.
So that even if we don't mix it in soup,
you can actually make meatballs-
we don't have to mix it in the soup.
There, then we'll just mix it.
What I meant by mixing, is
we'll combine it with the soup.
As for the extra meatballs,
you can fry it or air-fry it,
then dip it in ketchup, that will do.
And speaking of air fry, I'll do it
for this meatballs, once it's ready.
Air-frying the meatballs is optional, we
can just put the raw meatballs in soup and
just let it cook by boiling.
I just want to air fry it because the
outside texture will be so much better.
There.
So how will we know if
the we put enough flour?
If it looks wet, it means
that it needs more flour.
Okay so I'll add more
all-purpose flour here.
I'll put it all.
And once our mixture is
ready, so here as you can see,
It's not that wet, but still
sticky since we added flour.
I'll prepare the
container, because I'll
air-fry it, so here's
the part of the air fryer.
I'll just get water so the
meatballs won't stick to my hands.
I'll just wet my hands first.
And we'll scoop or get some
and eyeball how much I need.
And once our meatballs are ready,
I'll just put it inside my container,
in my air fryer, and
I'll do the same steps.
So it's better if you
have water on the side,
if you think the
meatballs mixture is sticking a bit.
It will slide or mold properly.
It won't stick on your hands.
So I'll just continue these steps.
Until I molded all the mixture.
And after, we'll air fry the
meatballs that I molded.
So that's okay, I molded
all our meat mixture,
so this is the time I should air fry it.
So now, our meatballs are ready.
We've set it in our air fryer in 375F.
Remember, this is not celsius.
So just convert it to
celsius. Eight minutes.
We don't need to cook it long here
because it will cook when we boil it later.
Okay so, I'll just close this,
and I'll air fry it. And for those who want
to use meatballs in other
dishes or just want to eat it,
just air fry it a bit longer to make
sure that it's cooked properly.
Okay so while we're waiting
to air fry the meatballs,
we'll go here to
loofah.
It's so long. So there,
we'll not use all of this.
Even 1/3 of this is enough.
The remaining parts-
we'll use it on other dishes.
So I'll just cut the loofah
that we'll need here.
Just this much. So the
challenge in this loofah,
is in peeling it. So if we're not used to
using knife in peeling loofah for example,
because it's simple, like
this- see? We peeled it.
I still prefer the easiest and fastest
way- we'll use vegetable peeler.
After several days when
you harvested the loofah,
It will slowly become soft, so
when you're using vegetable peeler,
peeling it becomes challenging.
So it's better to use the vegetable
peeler when you just harvested the loofah.
If you want to use knife, use
it, there's no problem at all.
So this is for the beginners like me.
We're using this to make it easier for us.
As time goes on you'll get use to peeling
the vegetable and it will be easier.
So you can use knife,
but as you can see when you use
vegetable peeler it becomes easier.
The loofah is okay, the
next thing we'll do is chop it.
So I'll just chop this loofah,
You can add more, especially if there's
a lot of people who will eat in the house.
So you can finish it all.
To make sure everyone is
full. So there, this is okay.
So I'll set aside this loofah, let's just
wait for the meatballs to get air fried.
After, let's start cooking.
At this point, our meatballs
are ready, so here it is.
It's partially cooked now. We'll
cook it completely later in soup.
I have another thing I want to teach you,
I just remembered after slicing the loofah.
So we'll add a bit more loofah,
just to show you my point.
So, earlier, we used a vegetable peeler,
just to peel the loofah.
Another easy way is to slice the loofah
in short width just like this- about
3-4 inches.
There, we'll just get a
knife and slice it here.
From top to bottom.
See? So it's up to you, this
is one of the easy approach
in slicing the loofah quickly.
Although, the catch here is
there's some that will come along.
But at least, when you're in a hurry,
This is one of the ways that you can use.
So, our loofah is ready, I'll set it aside.
Let's start cooking. I'm
just heating a wok here.
You can, of course, use a cooking pot.
The wok is smoking,
it means that it's ready.
So let's wait for the oil to get
hot and we'll start sauteing.
We'll put the garlic first.
When it comes to the soup, it's
more delicious if the garlic is toasted.
To really taste it better.
So I'll just saute this,
until it starts turning to brown.
So there you go.
I'll get the onion and add it here.
When it comes to the onion, we don't
have preference when it comes to color.
So any color of onion, it will do.
So the meatballs are ready,
it's here in the container.
So we two things we can do,
we can saute the meatballs,
here with the garlic and onion or we can
add it later when we add
the beef broth and it's boiling.
For this purpose, let's try sauteing it.
There, while the onion is getting soft,
So here, we'll saute the meatballs.
And it won't stick to each
other because it's air fried.
So if the meatballs you'll
be using isn't air fried,
I suggest to put it in later.
After adding the beef broth,
the type that's already boiling.
So since we stir fried this,
it won't stick to each other.
So we can saute this, even just
for a while. I'll just get our beef broth.
So just like what I said earlier,
not because beef broth is
what I'm using in our ingredient
list, you can't use others.
So if you don't have beef broth or
beef stock, you can use water instead.
We'll give flavor to it by
adding beef cube or pork cube.
Let's mix it,
I just need to boil it.
So here, at this point,
it's starting to boil.
So I'll lower it down because I'm on
high heat- I'll put it to medium heat.
So let's just boil the meatballs for about
7 minutes to make sure that it's cooked.
And for the flavor of meatballs to stick
and also seasoning we put in the soup,
and for those who want to save, actually,
we can still do this without the meatballs.
Even the simple ingredient like sardines,
So just one can sardines or tomato sauce,
either regular or spicy. It's good.
Let's substitute the
sardines to the meatballs.
And for the other ingredients- just the
same- like the misua, it's budget-friendly.
We have the water, actually, even
if you don't have pork or beef cube,
if we use sardines, because
the sauce is enough for the flavor.
So just add fish sauce to
taste, and it will be okay.
So at this point, I'll just wait
for the meatballs to get cooked.
After, we'll add the loofah
that we sliced earlier.
We're almost done, then, we'll
add the misua and other seasoning,
then it's done. So let's
wait for this to be ready.
So here's our
meatballs. Other than
the loofah, we can
use other alternatives.
For example, bottle gourd
or even chayote can be used.
Just slice it thinly. So for the loofah,
I'm just cooking this for 2 minutes.
It's good to cover the pot
when cooking the loofah.
Now, we'll add the misua.
If you added too much misua, that's okay.
Because if we add a lot of
misua, the liquid will reduce so
we can just add water.
After that, we'll season
it towards the end.
So there's no problem at all, we
can adjust the ingredients easily.
So while it's cooking,
I just want to taste
the meatballs because
I can't wait any longer.
I'll just get one meatball,
there, I'll just taste it.
Just to see if it tastes right, it's still
a bit hot, as you can see it's smoking hot.
Even if it's hot-
It's hot.
Okay.
So our meatballs is okay, and it's cooked.
Our meatballs are properly
cooked, it's just a bit hot.
So we have a lot of improvements
we can do, if you want this to be special.
We can add onion leaves in the mixture,
you can add garlic powder if you want,
but what we did earlier- very
simple but I think it's enough.
I'll just finish this.
The loofah is almost ready
so we'll add the misua.
There. So remember what I said
earlier, that if we add the misua,
and if you added too much,
because when we add
misua, it absorbs liquid.
Okay so we don't need to cover the
wok after adding the misua because,
it cooks quickly.
So usually, I cook this
for about 2 minutes.
Like this, as you can see,
the amount of misua that we added is okay.
It's around 4 ounces.
So for you to be sure if you
want to make the soup delicious,
just add the misua gradually.
But if you put too much, you
can just add water and adjust it.
We have one ingredient that I
didn't mention before for taste.
It's just the fish sauce. The
salt is for the meatballs earlier,
the fish sauce is for the soup.
So if the taste becomes
bland, we'll just add fish sauce.
So if you have toasted
garlic, I know that
there's toasted garlic
available in groceries,
we can add toasted
garlic here, it's delicious.
I'll just season with fish sauce.
And while seasoning,
I'll just lower the heat
and also season with
ground black pepper.
There.
I'll just mix it.
So it's not the last ingredient yet.
Because we'll use an optional ingredient.
When we say optional, you
already know, even without it, it's fine.
And I'm refering to the onion leaves.
Green onions or it's called spring onions.
I'll cut this and lower the heat.
After, we'll chop it.
So it's up to you how big or small
your green onions will be.
So there's still remaining
here, I'll add it later.
Once we're presenting
the dish or almondigas
in a bowl, because that's the
next thing I'll do, I'll transfer it to
small serving bowl and serve.
I'll just add an extra green onion on top,
so if you have toasted garlic
there, you can add it on top.
So that's how simple it is. I'll
transfer it to a serving bowl.
after that, we'll serve it. If you have
other suggestions how to make this tastier,
this misua with meatballs, what do you do?
Please share it in the comments,
so others can learn different ways.
That's good because we do
differently and not the same taste.
We can enjoy possibilities
in cooking this dish.
Okay, I'll transfer it
now. At this point, I
turned off the heat.
We'll just scoop from here
to the serving bowl. With
just this, you can feed a lot.
So the whole family will surely be full.
So guys, this is our almondigas
or misua with meatballs.
Just add extra green onions if you like,
it's simple right? Let's go and eat.
I'll just taste the soup
to know if it's okay.
It's good and delicious.
I can also taste the garlic even
thought we put a bit earlier but overall,
this is okay. So the
fish sauce really helps
to add taste.
Guys, I hope you try our recipe,
if you have any suggestion, feedback or
questions- even just comment, just do so.
And I promise if I have time to notice
you, of course, who am I to ignore?
