we're leaving manila today i felt very
restless the last week
and tired exhausted and
frustrated actually i wanted to show you
the place
but we decided not to
[Music]
here
[Music]
welcome to a huge packing
vlog today because this evening we are
heading out of the city for possibly
a few weeks for quite some time actually
we don't know
how long it is gonna be but it is going
to be a while
as you guys know i am currently doing my
private pilot's license here in the
philippines and i'm in the final stages
of my ground training so
both nelly and i will be relocating to
subic bay for the foreseeable
future so i can finish my training
and in case the lockdown comes here in
manila we'll be
out there in civic bay so i can continue
my flight school i can do
all my exams and i can start the actual
flying training
so today we need to sort out a bunch of
stuff we need to pack
things we have to decide what are we
bringing what are we leaving here
um because we won't be able to tell
exactly how long we're going to be gone
we don't know how the regulations are
going to change so
we need to be better prepared than the
last time where we got stranded in
charge for such a long time
this time it's not so serious because
we're just two hours away from manila
and if
uh lockdowns get extended or laws change
or regulations change we can still come
back home but
yeah for now it looks like we won't be
in manila
for a while of course we will also be
packing up
this little one she doesn't even know
yet but she
is going to be getting ready for a nice
little adventure
peanut really loves to travel she loves
to be in the car she loves to
explore new hotel rooms and places so we
found
a pet friendly accommodation in subic
and peanut is
excited are you excited and this time
i'm going to make sure my plants are
properly watered and safe and
taken care of because i don't want to
come back home see my pla
plants dying so that's going to be a
challenge for me so i need to
water my plants pack and that's it right
yeah just make sure we don't forget
anything number one essential for me
it's my coffee machine this time she is
coming with us
peanut you're only number two essential
[Music]
you're my priority don't bite me please
don't beg
me you're my priority
and we're also packing everything for
peanut
foxy goes into the box peanut
she's in there everything is in here
peanut for you
[Music]
okay we have a jungle situation here yes
we do
but before we hit the road yeah we're
just doing a quick swap test
wobby swabby because with our whoops
with our home kit yeah it's not a
requirement but
you know we have them at home so just be
safe yeah
just in general like every time we head
out either when we're eating out
or doing anything we always have these
at home and do our
home swap tests yeah for peace of mind
for peace of mind
sorry guys for some reason our audio
wasn't working but we
were ready to pack and go and had our
last dinner at home
last home cooked meal while watching
suits and then
we hit the road saying goodbye to the
condo
and off we go
focus our eyes on the journey
stepping into the unknown
waving goodbye to our worry
so we run okay we arrived in
subic bay but unfortunately we cannot
find
our accommodation
it's not showing up in google maps
we have no idea where we have to go
ah okay guys uh
it took us a while to find our airbnb
because because
hello hi because it was not on
google maps and it was also not on waze
and then we had some complications with
the check in
and actually i wanted to show you the
place
but we decided not to an olympia
all and above we need to note that this
is filmed over a week after the clips
you saw earlier on
so i don't want to go too much into
detail um
i just want to point out that it was not
a pleasant airbnb experience um
luckily we found a place that is awesome
so it made up for
the how do you say difficult start
i felt very restless the last week and
tired exhausted and frustrated
but we finally settled into our new
place and i can't wait to show you
a full tour tomorrow mike is getting
some
something from the petrol station
because we're going to cook here we have
a very very cute place
um and yeah that was basically it oh
what's going on here
wait what
[Laughter]

one eternity later we have some good
news as well so mike finished his
full grand training which means he
passed his
last five exams for the ground training
and um
he is now able to do the
uh what is it called simulator training
and hopefully
if the weather clears up he can fly for
the very first time making so much noise
