[Music]
and today we will be
reacting to a very interesting video um
i'm saying that because of the title of
the video that reads
do filipinos speak spanish debunking
myths i know for a fact that a lot of
your
last names are spanish or at least
derived
from spanish and i also know that in
filipino tagalog there are some
spanish words like pero you know what i
mean so
i think this video is going to be very
interesting
but before we start as usual please
consider following me on instagram at
music
game news and also i finished my
last beat i will be introducing it to
you
next week there you go all right without
further ado let's get to it
[Music]
but to be honest a lot of filipinos also
look spanish you know
[Music]
trisha velar
like
[Music]
philippines the philippines was a former
spanish colony
right so how come we don't speak spanish
or
do we prior to colonization the area now
known as the philippines was a group of
islands connected by water
independent advanced socially complex
and ethno-linguistically distinct
communities
ruled by respective tribal leaders
most of the time peacefully coexisted
with each other
i'm so excited because this sounds very
interesting and i like
how she is presenting the subject trade
with neighboring nations to the north
like china japan and taiwan and to the
south like malaysia and indonesia
was commonplace when fernando de
magallanes arrived in 1521
he united all islands into one nation
under the spanish crown and named it las
felipenas after philip ii of spain
from then on the philippines came under
spain's control and spear
of influence slowly but surely for the
next 333 years
that's a long time
the archipelago used to be spain's
primary foothold in asia
due to the philippines unique
geographical location
not only did it become an important base
for the
empire stake in the profitable spice
trade
it was also it's so beautiful i want to
be
there man come on a strategic location
for conducting commerce from
the americas to the far east what else
surprise surprise
most towns and cities also have hispanic
names you've got the obvious ones
towns being named after places within
spain
it's true it's true i never mentioned it
in my videos but yeah i did notice that
the names were very hispanic you know
in towns named after saints
anyone here from novo viscaya nueva is
cordoba at least once to a place
named santa cruz san pablo or san
nicolas
another thing worth mentioning is that
having a hispanic last name
there you go what did i say at the
beginning
or a hispanic sounding last name is a
norm i can bet you that
that is not hispanic top 20 filipino
last names are all
hispanic and orange bautista like the
actor
there you go who is a part
uh filipino jin i can tell you how many
cruces
santos races
that i know if you're from the
philippines but see
she pronounces them uh with a hispanic
accent
filipinos don't leave a comment below on
what do you think is the most common
surname
or in tagalog
see these guys streamline government
processes see those
faces are filipinos like census and tax
collection
and to further strengthen their rule
spanish colonizers
enacted a law making it mandatory for
everyone to adopt a surname
i feel like she is reading from
somewhere
you know uh because she's not looking at
the camera straight like i'm looking at
you like this right
she's looking here like above you know
so she's reading something
and like she's not making any mistakes
which means she's not freestyling she's
definitely reading
there was literally a catalog where
people can choose spanish or local
surnames from
most of the indigenous lowland
population and some
chinese immigrants as well chose to
change their last names to hispanic last
names
probably believing that this change
might benefit them yeah food
things oh yes
the list goes on a double
is a name derived from spanish huh
the most like common and popular
filipino dish right adobo there are
roughly around
4 000 spanish loanwords in tagalog the
most spoken dialect in the country
and roughly around 6 000 in visaya
another widely spoken dialect lots of
words are spelled differently
or bastardized and lots of phrases are
used in a different context these two
dialects in particular
because the regions where it's most
widely spoken
were centers of spanish governance
which are manila and cebu yeah look at
the lights
[Music]
yes almost everyone in the philippines
knows
how to count in spanish up to 100 and
they don't even know it
for example
the way we say the time in the
philippines is also the same
for regency
days of the week and months are also the
same
nosotros
for example
lots of words related to kitchenware or
cooking are also
similar zapatos
uh
and so are things in relation to law and
governance
and then there is chavacano a
spanish-based crayola language
widely spoken in the zamboanga region
brief history
in the hopes of further uniting the
archipelago under christianity and under
their spear of influence
the spaniards established samwanga as a
foothold in the predominantly
muslim wow it's so beautiful from south
a means to communicate was needed
between the locals and the spaniards
in many cases some spaniards will learn
the local language to gain trust
and establish a connection with the
local population but in this case
a grammatically simplified form of a
language used for communication between
two people
not sharing common language was
established this is what you call a
pidgin
which then event she made
a beginner's mistake while
positioning the camera and herself to
film this
video because clearly the light is
behind her
which makes her look very dim you know
she should have
taken the place of the camera and put
the camera where she is
so that the light could be on her uh
that's why you can see the light so
bright behind her you know
eventually turned into chavacana
although spelling of words might differ
it is very similar that a person
speaking
sufficiently an aptly converts to a
spanish-speaking person
during spain's 333 year long rule
spanish was
of course a widely spoken language it
was even officially considered a
national language
alongside english and tagalog until it
officially wasn't
in 1987. after 300 years when i was born
there is a rule you'd think spanish
would be widely spoken about
the country today like it is in most
latin american countries but
no for almost a century now english has
been the country's lingua franca what
happened
first of all the majority of the
indigenous population of the philippines
remained
intact unlike in latin america where the
indigenous population was
wiped out not only by the colonizers but
also by imported diseases furthermore
because of the philippines relative
distance and isolation from the rest of
the spanish colonies
not a lot of spanish people emigrated to
the archipelago
next in terms of literacy and education
during the spanish colonial period as it
is today
it is a privileged excuse only reserved
for those in the upper class of
philippine society
meaning spanish-born immigrants also
known as peninsulares philippine-born
spanish people
also known as insolaris and
half-filipino half-spanish people
also known as mestizos basically
mixed people 30 of the population in the
greater part of colonial rule the
majority
of the population didn't have access to
education
despite developing a public school
system towards the latter part of
colonial rule
yeah but how would you explain that
filipinos can speak english and not
spanish
i mean if they're they don't have access
to education
it probably means that they don't have
access to english as well
the masses still were not able to
adequately express themselves in spanish
and
were still more comfortable in their
native time to add to that
throughout all the years of colonial
rule everyday transactions
of the masses were conducted in the
native language
it just faded away i guess unfortunately
because i think the spanish language is
gorgeous
[Music]
wow big picture there really was no true
social and cultural and linguistic
assimilation that happened in the
philippines
towards the end of the spanish colonial
rule a strong sense of nationalism
also emerged in the philippines mainly
propagated by the filipino
spanish-speaking
mostly european educated class aka
illustrados filipinos long to
distinguish themselves from their
colonizers so when did the
transition to english begin well to
begin with spain
seeded the philippines guam and puerto
rico
to the united states in 1898 under the
treaty of paris
this means american dominance in the
archipelago henceforth
the americans also set out to establish
a philippine public school system
and a system of governance mirrored
after the american systems
all of course anchored in english so
that's the difference i think the main
difference is that americans
actually made sure
that filipinos or at least some
filipinos
would learn the english language by
installing a school system
the masses now have access to learn a
language
more than their native tongue the rest
is history as they say
at the early stages of american
colonization filipinos
ate up american hegemony and they still
do
the american dream is still strong
amongst filipinos just
look at the filipino diaspora all across
50 american states
filipino nurses will fill states
shortage
in the philippines american pop culture
still reigns supreme
consumer behavior is still mostly
dictated by what's trendy in the united
states
and i don't know and i don't know if
you've noticed but but
in like american tv shows and movies
the filipino if you will cliches are
there like
every time there is a nurse in a tv show
or a movie
it's usually a filipino you know or
a maid or something you know they always
choose filipinos and i'm like
really you know
if you have any other ideas as to why
filipinos
don't speak spanish please share your
insights in the comment box below

penang

what if we spoke spanish it would be
fantastic our life and economy right now
