This is My Neighbor, Charles 
where we meet foreigners living in Korea. 
- Hello. / - Hello! 
It's now March. 
There are New Year's Day and Seollal, 
but March is when... 
- We really make a new start. / - March. 
Don't try to make excuses. 
You've been avoiding your diet... 
- I'll start now. / - You said January 1st... 
Seollal... Now you're saying March. 
- I'm going to start now. / - Sheesh... 
Today's guest became very busy as it's March. 
She's a mother of 3 children. 
- Yes. / - She raises 3 kids. 
3 kids? 
Let's bring her in. 
Today's guest, come on out. 
Come on out! 
- Hello. / - Welcome. 
Please introduce yourself. 
Hello, I've been in Korea for... 
- Seven... How do I say it? Seven... / - 17 years. 
17 years. 
I have 3 kids and my name is Cho Serin. 
- Nice to meet you. / - Likewise! 
- And you must be the husband? / - Yes. 
I'm Serin's husband, Kim Jinsang. 
We're from Bukgo, Nohwa, 
Wando, Jeollanam-do. 
Do you know where Ttangkkeut is? 
It's a 30-minute boat ride from Ttangkkeut. 
Ttangkkeut is really far and you're even farther? 
- It's an Island, right? / - Yes, that's right. 
You two resemble each other. 
Yes. 
It's like you two were destined to be together. 
- You two look great together. / - I'm happy too. 
That was so mushy! 
A couple of 17 years! Sheesh! 
I see some kids... 
- I see 3 kids over there. Who are they? / - Hello. 
- Those are my 3 sons. / - My sons. 
Isn't it hard with 3 boys? 
- It's hard! / - I bet. 
I really respect you. 
How do you raise 3 boys? 
You guys took a 7-hour drive... 
- Just to come to this shoot? / - Yes. 
- What a trip. / - That's amazing. 
You all seem like a happy family with no problems. 
Do you guys have any concerns? 
I have a lot of concerns. 
A lot? Really? 
I have several jobs. 
And my wife wants to do something else. 
That's why... It's a concern. 
They're a happy family with some concerns 
that they're struggling with. 
Let's take a look at Nohwado... 
- And see how they live. / - Let's see Nohwado. 
I've never been there. Let's watch now. 
(My Neighbor, Charles) 
Ttangkkeut. 
(If you go farther south from Ttangkkeut) 
- Wow, that's it? / - So pretty. 
- Look at the color of the water. / - Beautiful. 
Look at the seaweed. 
(Seaweed is the pride of Nohwado) 
I guess they're known for seaweed. 
(And Nohwado is famous for something else) 
What are those running animals? 
They're cows. 
Cows? 
- I thought they were horse. / - You have cows? 
- You raise cows? / - Yes, I have cows. 
Wow, that's so cool. 
Hi! 
(Starts the day by saying hello to the cows) 
Hi, everyone. 
- Bring the fodder. / - Wow. 
How many cows do you have? 
Around 60. 
That's not that many. 
Since we're selling this one later, 
I have to feed her twice the amount. 
In the afternoon too. 
We have to get her nice and fat to sell her. 
They have to eat a lot to get healthy. 
They're trembling after hearing they'll be sold. 
The cows are roaming around freely. 
I have around 33,000mÂ² of land, so I let them graze. 
- They must be happy cows. / - Yes. 
Is there another place in Nohwado that has cows? 
No. Just us. 
I bet you never get a day off. 
My younger sibling is taking care of things today. 
I bet all they can think of is their ranch. 
They want to go back and work. 
I bet it takes hours to feed them all. 
Finished feeding them? 
(The 3 sons also help out) 
My first son. Isn't he handsome? He's Pyeonghwa. 
Isn't he handsome? 
(Smiling at what his mom said) 
What's your job here, Pyeonghwa? 
For me... Get over here. 
How cute! 
I take care of the livestock here with him. 
My second brother and my mom do the other side. 
And my dad does the one down there. 
I bet it's great that all your sons help out. 
- Yes, they help us. / - Such good boys. 
They especially help a lot when they're on holidays. 
(Pyeonghwa takes care of the livestock outside) 
So the oldest son is the boss. 
(Hwamok takes care of the livestock inside) 
The work is going fast with the sons helping out. 
So reliable. 
- It's faster. / - Pyeonghwa and Hwamok. 
Pyeongjeong... 
- Pyeongjeong... / - Such unique names. 
He has to always stay composed. 
(Quiet! I did nothing!) 
(Pyeongjeong's dad shows up to help him) 
The cows get a lot of exercise. 
Yes, they do. 
I used to keep pigs 7 to 8 years ago. 
Then after that... 
This is an island, so I was worried about the demand 
and I switched to cows. 
Cows are sold at higher prices. 
And this is my life now. 
That's how life is. 
What a good-looking couple. 
So pretty. 
They look happy. 
(They got married and settled in Nohwado) 
(The loving couple had 3 sons) 
- Look at them. / - They look playful. 
(They're living happily as a family of 5) 
(Serin is an English teacher) 
- You live right in front of the sea. / - Yes. 
(The family's home is right in front of the sea) 
Look at me. 
Will you be able to follow this schedule? 
No... 
(Talking about Pyeongjeong's holiday homework) 
(He has to remember to feed the cows) 
- Feed the cows. / - That's the first thing he wrote. 
This is free time and so is this... 
He's nagging. 
So you get 3 hours of free time? 
(Sad) 
You have to write neatly so other people can read it. 
If you don't study, 
you should at least do your homework. 
- Got it? / - Yeah... 
Do a good job. 
Done. 
You nag your sons a lot, Jinsang. 
You're strict. 
(Time for Serin to start nagging) 
(Mother's English class starts) 
An English class. 
You teach him yourself, Serin? 
What letter is this? 
I told you not to write like this. 
How do you write it? That looks like a U. 
- You're good at English, Serin? / - Yes. 
She worked at an English academy... 
- For 4 years. / - You taught English? 
She even taught an after-school program. 
I quit last year. 
She's taught English for over 10 years. 
She's the best teacher. 
What does "between" mean? 
Next to? Behind? 
In front of? 
Between is in front of, next to and behind? 
- So this and this. What is it? / - Between. 
Right! This ruler is between the eraser and the pen. 
He doesn't need to go to an English academy. 
(Carrot-and-stick method is a must to teach) 
But... 
Pyeongjeong is the youngest, right? 
(A phone call from the Philippines) 
Mom, I'm with Pyeongjeong and Hwamok. 
It's grandma. 
Grandma and grandpa. 
- Hello, Hwamok! / - Hello! 
- He still remembers Korean. / - He wouldn't forget. 
Mom, what's that? 
- Dishcloths. / - Oh, dishcloths!! 
Those are towels used to do the dishes. 
I put a gift in the brown box too. 
(The box that Serin sent) 
Those are all noodles. 
- Noodles? / - Instant noodles. 
- Instant noodles. / - Instant noodles. 
Instant noodles are very popular. 
So even Filipinos love Korean instant noodles. 
Yes, my entire family loves Korean instant noodles. 
(Serin is always doing things for her Filipino family) 
My mom is Filipino, 
so she lives the Filipino way, 
but everyone here lives the Korean way. 
My dad said they used a translator app 
to communicate at first. 
I bet that was really annoying for my mom 
and she wanted to go back to the Philippines. 
(Choked up) 
He's all grown up. 
He understands his mom. 
He's all grown up. 
(Embarrassed) 
These days, I can see their faces with video calls. 
Technology has advanced. 
I'm satisfied with that. 
I like it in Korea. 
Since I have my sons here... 
You raised them to be such reliable boys. 
I never knew my son felt that way. 
(Really?) 
Which son listens to you the most 
and is always giving you hugs? 
That's a tough question. 
They're all insisting it's them! 
(How cute) 
(Thankful people) 
Hi. 
I'm here. 
- Oh, hey! / - I brought something. 
That's my older cousin's house. 
- That's it? / - Filipino rice cakes. 
- Rice cakes? / - Yes. 
They have rice cakes in the Philippines. 
You brought so much. 
They're for you. 
They have to be heated up. 
I made them with my friends yesterday. 
And I wanted you to try some. 
- Let's heat them up later. / - Yes. 
They're like Korean rice cakes. 
So they're similar. 
We make this rice cake often. 
Do kids like it too? 
Yes, they do. 
- And my husband loves it. / - Really? 
I thought of you after I made these. 
I want you to have some. I'm thankful... 
It won't take long. 
What was your first impression of Serin? 
She was cute and pretty. 
We were excited to meet her. 
We've never had a foreigner here. 
I'm thankful that she's adjusted well. 
She helped me out a lot. 
So she's like your older sister. 
- Yes. / - I see. 
(She graduated college from the Philippines) 
- A graduation photo. / - She graduated college. 
After living in a warm country... 
- I bet snow was amazing to see. / - It really was! 
She didn't know how to do anything at first. 
I didn't know. 
- I couldn't speak Korean... / - The food... 
She couldn't speak the language. 
And she wasn't used to the food. 
But she really improved. 
She's a fast learner if you just teach her. 
I only have to teach her how to do something once. 
She's like my mother-in-law. 
I'm very thankful for her. 
That's amazing. Even in Japan... 
People that live on islands or in the countryside 
tend to be closed off to outsiders and foreigners. 
It's amazing that you adjusted so well. 
That's really hard to do. 
(She made these Filipino rice cakes with love) 
Suman... 
Those are banana leaves. 
Oh, banana leaves. 
- You made these, Serin? / - Yes, I made them. 
Teach everyone else in the village. 
Sure, sure! I'll teach them! 
All you need are banana leaves... 
And you can make them easily. 
You could sell those. 
You should try one first. 
She gave one to her first. 
(She can feel the chewy texture in her mouth) 
- It's good. / - It's glutinous rice. 
It's filled with a lot of... 
They're called suman. 
She really seems adjusted to living in Korea. 
(They all love it) 
She's so kind to her neighbors. 
Nobody else in our village is this kind. 
She's great. 
(Saying nice things) 
My husband's family members... 
His aunts, sisters and brothers... 
They're all on my side. 
They're so sweet and kind to me. 
(Two families under one roof) 
Gosh, look at that kimchi... 
Who made this kimchi? 
- I did last year. / - You make kimchi too? 
Yes. 
She did 80 heads of cabbage this year. 
80? 
- All by herself. / - By herself? 
How many did you make, Wonjeong? 
I buy my kimchi. 
Who did you learn that from? 
Who was it? 
From my in-laws and neighbors. 
I think she's good at cooking. 
Yes, she is. She's an experienced housewife. 
(Bragging) 
And she probably learned Jeolla-do cooking. 
- I bet it's delicious. / - Gosh... 
(Her sister-in-law gave birth a month ago) 
(Serin's sister-in-law) 
- How cute. / - The sister-in-law. 
(Jinsang's younger brother also married a Filipino) 
- Your sister-in-law is Filipino too? / - Yes. 
He saw how happy you two were, 
so it looks like he also 
married a Filipino woman. 
(The husbands take care of the baby) 
(One month old) 
(An angel) 
He has a lot of hair. 
I'm really jealous of all that hair. 
(Big smile) 
He looks like your wife. 
Doesn't really look like you though. 
(He's just happy) 
You and your younger brother look exactly alike. 
- He's the father, right? / - Yes. 
(Expert at infant care) 
You have to be physically affectionate... 
So he'll be more stable when he's older. 
Tell your wife. 
My wife won't let me hold the baby. 
My younger brother is pretty old. 
He was unmarried for a very long time. 
But now that he's happily married, 
that makes me happy as his brother. 
Is it another son? 
- Yes. / - It's a son. 
A lot of sons. 
So many sons in this family. 
We have 6 boys and 1 girl. 
(My gosh) 
- Goodness... / - Daughters are rare. 
- Really? / - That's amazing. 
(Serin shows her sister-in-law her kimchi stew recipe) 
(Tasty looking) 
Wow, that kimchi... It looks delicious. 
Nice job. Cut off and throw out the ends. 
I can't guarantee it'll taste good. 
The husband teaches parenting 
and the wife teaches how to make kimchi stew. 
This kimchi is delicious. It's from last year. 
That sounds good. 
They added a ton of pork! 
Kimchi stew is my favorite Korean dish. 
After trying a lot of Korean dishes... 
(Now they just have to let it boil) 
Who made this seaweed soup? 
What did you put in this? 
Chicken. 
She put chicken in seaweed soup? 
That's a first. 
Chicken in seaweed soup... 
I wonder how it tastes. 
Is it okay to put chicken in seaweed soup? 
I've never seen this before. 
It tastes bad. Look at her face! 
I guess chicken and seaweed aren't a good fit. 
It's a bit strange, 
but it was good because my sister-in-law made it. 
Is this sesame oil or soybean oil? 
The smell... 
(He tries the unique seaweed soup) 
(Complicated) 
- He can't even comment on it. / - Try some. 
See how it tastes. 
She doesn't even like it... 
Look at her face. 
It's good. 
- She said it's good. / - Then you eat all of this. 
She's sweet, but she can be pretty strict. 
She's scarier than a mother-in-law. 
Oh... 
She says I'm scary. 
Do you nag her? 
All the time... 
- Why do you do things for her? / - Me? 
Why? Because she's my sister-in-law. 
My husband's brother's wife. 
I should teach her stuff since 
she doesn't have a mother-in-law. 
I want to teach her everything I know. 
- I bet you wish you had a mother-in-law. / - Yes. 
She seems lonely. 
At least she seems lonely to me. 
She reminds me of when I first moved here. 
I'm reminded of that time. 
So I teach my sister-in-law 
the things that I learned here. 
(Today's dish is finished) 
My mother passed away early. 
(Today's dish is finished) 
It's good, right? 
This is good kimchi. Where is it from? 
I made this kimchi with my own two hands. 
I bet it tastes great with everyone eating together. 
I'm jealous. 
She makes kimchi for us. 
She even brings us meat to use in the stew. 
She watches our baby too. She bathes him... 
She's really helpful and I'm thankful. 
(Embarrassed and pleased) 
You rarely go out now that you have the baby. 
Go out for some fresh air. 
- Want to go out together? / - Okay. 
She doesn't trust my brother with the baby. 
Does he even know how to hold a baby? 
(That afternoon) 
(The two Filipino brides go out together) 
Yeah, it's nice to go out like this. 
(They go to Filipino get-together) 
- You guys have get-togethers? / - Yes. 
Usually in the evening and not during the day. 
They get together for dinner. 
We're all Filipino. 
Serin is best friends with my aunt in the Philippines. 
She and my aunt set me up 
with a Korean man that I married when I was 29. 
Serin got them all Korean husbands. 
She was like a match-maker. 
(They all met by fate and settled on the island) 
She's like the godmother. 
I guess the men of Nohwado 
don't have to worry about finding a bride. 
They all came to Korea 
after seeing how happy Serin is. 
You're a role model. 
On social media... 
- Oh, the battered wives? / - Yeah, I feel so bad. 
(Getting emotional) 
I don't even want to read stuff like that. 
It's sad when you hear about things like that. 
We all have great husbands. 
(They're interested in other overseas brides) 
I've received a lot of love in Korea. 
(They continue to chat) 
What do you do these days? 
I bet you want to work. 
Of course I do. I have to make money. 
Do you know what I want? 
What do you want? 
I want... A job! 
I want to work. 
Why don't you find another job? 
You used to teach English. 
- Is housework too tiring? / - I want to... 
That's not tiring. Housework is fine. 
I just want my own job. 
Yeah, I bet Serin wants to do her own thing. 
Sure. She even graduated college. 
She has what it takes. 
You have your cows. 
That's her husband's job. 
That's my husband's job. 
I'm kind of jealous that you have cows. 
They're reliable. 
- Those cows... / - You have 60 of them. 
I'm kind of jealous. 
I studied college in UCEI. 
United Computer Educational Institution 
in Lucena City. 
I worked there for 7 years as a secretary. 
I worked at a computer company. 
It was great and it was really helpful for me. 
I used to have my own job and got paid a salary. 
I just want to do something that I can do. 
Women our age experience that a lot. 
You feel like doing something 
once your kids are grown up. 
I bet you know a lot of women like that. 
I had a job in the Philippines. 
But I came here and I got married. 
I have kids now. So it's hard to find a job. 
- It's really hard. / - Right. 
(That night) 
(Where are they headed after chatting?) 
Didn't you say you'd only be out for an hour? 
You went somewhere else. 
- Round 2. / - Karaoke. 
Do they have Filipino songs? 
Yes! They have Filipino songs. 
- Filipinos are good at singing. / - Yeah. 
(If you're stressed out, look to the Filipino godmother!) 
Look at all those gestures she's making 
as she's singing. 
She's definitely partied before. 
She loves to party. 
(âª You'll always be my man âª) 
We get together often to relieve stress 
and talk about what's been getting us down. 
- We come here often. / - They need that. 
Serin, who's your man? 
My husband is my man. 
My one and only husband. 
- Were you thinking of your husband? / - Yes! 
I always sing this song. 
Every time I come to karaoke... 
It sounds like they're really close. 
(Don't get stressed out and be happy, you two) 
(Time to find the light) 
Where is this place? 
We're buying fodder. 
To feed the cows. 
So this is the only place that sells this fodder. 
You need a truck to buy fodder for 60 cows. 
How much? 
$150. $10 per sack. 
That's expensive... 
- That's not expensive. / - Isn't that expensive? 
They're $10 per sack. How is that not expensive? 
Think about their commission. 
They're not making that much. 
So you know. Thank you. 
(Worried about the owner) 
They have to pay their employees. 
It's like volunteer work. 
How much does it cost a month to feed your cows? 
- Around $3,000. / - $3,000? 
- See? That's why... / - For the fodder? 
(We shouldn't be worrying about others now) 
I'll pay for this next week. 
Sure. 
Thank you for your continued patronage. 
I should thank you. 
I haven't paid them in 3 months. 
I have to sell some cows first, but I haven't yet. 
So I told them to give me some time. 
I have to pay what I owe them. 
- It's on a tab? / - Yes. 
(The couple fight over money) 
When are you going to pay them? 
This is so embarrassing. 
- Why? / - She's not used to being in debt. 
She even hates small debts. 
You feel uneasy when you owe someone money. 
Yes! We have a lot of debt. 
How are you going to make that money? 
Would you stop it? 
You keep saying the same thing. 
I'll get the money soon. 
It's always tough at first. We just started. 
It'll all be fine starting this year. 
We'll sell seaweed and kelp. 
I have nothing to say. 
Of course you don't. 
I just don't have the money yet. 
It'll be fine once the money is in rotation. 
I'll get the money soon versus when? 
That's what they're fighting about. 
We'll get paid for the seaweed in March. 
- Are you sure? / - Yes, I'm sure. 
That's when I collect. 
A real married couple's fight. 
(They're back at the ranch already) 
Want some help? 
Are you being sincere? 
She acts cute often. 
That's why she's so loved. 
You're right. 
(Struggling) 
That probably weighs more than you do. 
It does not! 
I weigh... 
Stop. Let me. 
(It's like they never even fought) 
They were fighting in the car a few minutes ago. 
That's what it's like when a married couple fights. 
(Time to fill their empty stomachs) 
(They prepare dinner together) 
Let's eat Spanish mackerel later. 
I can tell by their kitchen that they do 
a lot of housework. 
They seem very thorough. 
(Today's dinner is Spanish mackerel) 
That's unique. 
Since we're having raw fish, 
don't bother folding out the legs. 
Cover that in newspaper. 
(They all help get dinner ready) 
- Are we going to let it thaw? / - Of course. 
What is that? 
Spanish mackerel. 
You're cutting it up yourself? 
The raw fish... 
Our kids love raw fish. 
(Nom) 
There won't be any left for the parents. 
They start eating as soon as it's sliced. 
They tend to eat a lot at that age. 
(They talk about working at sea) 
You want to go tomorrow with dad? 
Pyeongjeong, you need to try it. 
Pyeongjeong, you're not ready to go out to sea? 
- No. / - Then what is it? 
I'm ready, but I don't want to go. 
See, dad? He says he's ready. 
Take him with you. 
He has two older brothers. 
They work at sea. 
I get the youngest to help out when needed. 
His brothers complain about that a lot... 
That I don't take him to sea 
and that I should start taking him. 
He's too young still. 
I'd be worried if he took our youngest to sea. 
She's never worked at sea either. 
(Yikes...) 
(But you live on an island) 
- You haven't been out to sea? / - To the sea? 
I'm scared. 
You're scared of the sea? 
But you're Filipino. 
I lived in a city in the Philippines. 
Oh, you lived in a city. 
So that's why. 
Last year, we regained the control of our sea. 
That's why I invested a lot in kelp 
and seaweed late last year. 
Now we have to collect all that. 
It's a very important time. 
(Early in the morning) 
Are you going now? 
(Serin is by the sea) 
(She seems well armed) 
I should go check it out. It's our first harvest. 
I should see how everything turned out. 
To see if it turned out well or not. 
We went out for our first harvest. 
- This is the first harvest? / - Yes. 
Seaweed. 
We're going to check on the seaweed. 
(Serin and the youngest son are on the boat) 
The youngest son. 
You have to raise cows and harvest seaweed... 
- You look nervous. / - She seems worried. 
You seem scared. 
I can't swim. 
I never swim at the beach. 
I just watch. 
I don't like swimming. 
That was my first time out at sea. 
(Following the current) 
Wow, that's huge. 
- Gosh! / - My goodness! 
I bet it's scary. 
(She's still nervous at the seaweed farm) 
And it was really cold that day. 
And the boat is shaky. 
So that's seaweed. 
It's that big? 
The small seeds grew this big. 
Yeah! They got so big. 
Wow, that's fascinating. 
- Is it? / - Yeah. 
It's her first time seeing seaweed. 
Yes, I was surprised. 
- She's only seen it dried. / - Really? 
We haven't been doing this for that long. 
- That looks pretty good. / - Right? 
They look like they grew well. 
This is your first time here. I bet you're amazed. 
(Amazed and excited) 
We get paid per kilogram for this. 
Like $5, $7 or $3 per kilogram. 
Once it's dried... 
- Look. / - It'll become fun if you... 
- Think of all that as money. / - Right. 
It's like you're pulling money out of the water. 
(No more debt! Time to profit!) 
Don't spray people with the hose, Pyeongjeong. 
Don't spray people. 
Like this. Pyeongjeong. Aim it down. 
- Strong water pressure? / - That's it. 
(They're happy to see the fresh seaweed) 
Doesn't that feel nice, seaweed? 
We're getting you nice and clean. 
You have to wash and wipe them down? 
Yes, to get rid of the debris. 
It's amazing that they got this big. 
My sons don't have to worry about getting jobs. 
They'll inherit the family business. 
My cows, the seaweed and kelp. 
So I'm not worried about them finding jobs. 
I should start teaching them now. 
Of course, they learn stuff at school too. 
But they need to learn this to live here. 
This is professional knowledge. 
Yeah, the 3 boys are lucky. 
Their father started so many businesses. 
- They can just take one up. / - Yeah. 
(Dissatisfied) 
Our boys should study. 
They should study. Not do this stuff. 
Studying comes first. 
They can learn this stuff later. 
Did you study a lot, Serin? 
(But they both want their sons to grow up healthy) 
I studied hard. 
I bet it's cold out. 
It looks cold. 
(The couple hang the seaweed up to dry) 
You're always asking when we'll get paid. 
I know it was hard, 
but how does the seaweed make you feel? 
You used to struggle with this. 
I'm happy after seeing the seaweed. 
It was hard, but we're seeing results now. 
I'll let you know how I feel once we get paid. 
Once we get paid? 
Yeah, you won't know until you get the money. 
That's true. 
(They just started, so they haven't been paid yet) 
This is around 20% of the seaweed. 
Only 20%? 
No, this is 80%. 
- 80%? / - More than that. 
(We hope they make a lot of money) 
How many different businesses do you need 
to be satisfied? 
It's too much work. 
The more things you try to attempt, 
the more money you have to invest. 
How's everything going? 
(She just laughs) 
She just laughs... 
Are you making a profit? 
Have you been making money? 
No, we haven't gotten paid yet. 
We're spending a lot, but not making much. 
Your cows seem nice and healthy. 
Men usually go into debt 
when they start a business. 
But that makes the wives worry. 
She has to buy food to feed her 3 sons. 
They can't be in debt. 
Then how are you supposed to start a business? 
They have to run their business! 
(The two brothers make stuffed pancakes) 
Stuffed pancakes. 
The boys look excited. 
What are the stuffed pancakes for? 
We're making them while our parents work outside. 
How sweet. 
They're making that for their parents? 
- Do you cook for them often? / - No. 
But they seemed really tired today. 
How sweet. 
They're good at cooking basic stuff. 
- Really? / - Yes. 
(A big serving filled with love) 
- Mom, dad, eat some stuffed pancakes. / - Wow! 
You brought us snacks. 
- Stuffed pancakes. / - Who made those? 
You boys aren't even wearing socks. 
We're not cold. 
How are you not cold? 
Wow, these look great. 
Most kids that age don't do stuff like that. 
How sweet of them. 
These stuffed pancakes are delicious. 
Probably because they're filled with sugar. 
- Those look good. / - Yeah. 
This is good. 
You seemed upset this morning, 
but it's nice to see you smiling now. 
(Please forget about that, dad) 
(The snack makes them forget their worries) 
(Time alone for the couple) 
- I bet you're tired. / - Yeah. 
Just wait. 
It's hard, but we'll make a lot of money 
and I'll make you happy. 
I'll be waiting for that. 
Is there something you want to do? 
A ton of stuff! 
Like what? 
- Will you let me then? Will you? / - Of course. 
I want to find my own job. 
A job? 
I don't want you working at a restaurant. 
Never. 
Not a restaurant. Something else. 
Like what? 
Just something... 
Once it's a sure thing 
and you give me permission, I'm going to do it. 
Let's try to find your dream. 
If not this year, next year. 
- You can do what you want to do. / - Alright. 
Let's go. It's cold. 
(They had a nice heart-to-heart talk) 
(What do I really want to do?) 
Where are you going by yourself? 
- I'm going to Wando. / - By yourself? 
I want to see how the job goes and 
I'd like to start working if they have a position. 
I'll learn whatever I need to learn. 
I want to ask questions and get some advice. 
Serin, you seem like you always have to do 
what you want to do. 
You seem determined. 
Because you hate going on boats. 
(She visits the Wando multi-cultural center first) 
You have to go out and look. 
Hello. 
Hello. 
- Long time no see. / - They all stood up... 
She's like the president. 
The president of the Philippines. 
I bet she'll feel at ease 
when they welcome her like that. 
I'm here to ask you a question. 
I'm looking for a job... 
- You're here for advice? / - Yes. 
Let's go this way then. 
(Support for multi-cultural families) 
So you're looking for a job? 
You're not too old for that. 
You can still get a job. 
The best way to use your strengths 
would be to be a translator. 
Or lecturing on multi-cultural families. 
You'd visit schools or kindergartens... 
I'd love to learn how to do that. 
Lecturing on multi-cultural families. 
- That's some good advice. / - Yeah. 
- As expected from an expert. / - Yes. 
Nohwado has many elderly living there. 
Some of the heads of the women's groups 
are overseas brides. 
If those young people work hard, 
they can become the leaders of their communities. 
As you can see, they're working very hard. 
If you want to work here, 
you need a license. 
We have translators too. 
They took the TOPIK exam. 
If you get to level 4, you can start working here. 
She used to be level 3, but she studied really hard 
and now, she works here. 
She's been working here for 2 years. 
Come by often. 
And... 
Those are all role models for Serin. 
I bet you were envious of them. 
She's a translator from Cambodia. 
How long have you been here? 
- Here? / - Yes. 
- 5 years. / - 5 years. 
She's been doing this work for 5 years. 
She's a veteran here. 
First of all, it's nice that I can make money here. 
Second, I'm proud that I can tell my kids 
that I work in an office. 
That's pretty impressive. 
And I've learned a lot from this job. 
So I like it here. 
Thank you. 
(Encouraging) 
I should study first. 
I saw an empty spot over there. 
She saw an empty spot. 
(We hope Serin's name will take up this empty spot) 
Yeah, wouldn't that be nice with her name there? 
(A workshop to learn handicrafts) 
Where is this place? 
Hello. 
I want to learn from here. 
- To learn? / - Yes, I want to learn. 
Nobody does leather crafting in Nohwado. 
You could make stuff like this and sell them. 
Please teach me. 
After I learn this, I could teach others. 
And I can sell the stuff that I make. 
You'd make a profit. 
Leather crafting... 
A lot of people do that these days. 
Yeah. 
This is from one cow. 
She knows all about cows. 
(An expert at cows?) 
She's a veteran. 
I have 60 cows. 
So that's 60 of these sheets. 
We should sell you one of our cows. 
(That's double the profit from one cow?) 
Two birds with one stone... 
You're doing great. 
Slowly, just like that. 
(Smiling from ear to ear) 
So pretty! 
That looks great. 
You're good at that. 
I can do stuff like this. 
- I want to learn. / - You're good at it. 
So you could do something like this. 
There are programs at schools... 
- To teach this to kids... / - Yes, they do. 
That's a useful skill to learn. 
Leather crafting. It sounds nice. 
(Someone is waiting for Serin) 
Why did you come here? Why? 
I was waiting for you. 
What's going on? Why are you here? 
- I missed you. / - You missed me? 
Good job. Did you have fun? 
Are you acting cute for her? 
- How cute. / - I had a lot of fun. 
You didn't get seasick on the boat? 
- You usually do. / - I didn't get seasick today. 
(It looks like she's feeling much better now) 
She seems more cheerful. 
Her voice sounds excited. 
She checked out some potential jobs. 
My husband... Thank you! 
(Riding a cable car in 10 years) 
- A cable car? / - In 10 years? 
This feels new. How long ago was it? 
I think it was 18 years ago. 
Time sure flies. 
That's where we went for our honeymoon. 
- Oh, really? / - Where is that place? 
Daeheungsa, Haenam. 
We took a cable car there. 
- In 10 years... / - Almost 20 years. 
That was our first time here. 
(Sweet) 
(They get more loving as they take the cable car) 
We went with friends. 
It felt so new since it's been a while. 
They have cable cars there too? 
It goes up high. 
Couples put locks here so they don't break up. 
Did you guys do that too? 
We didn't use a lock, but we didn't break up. 
"We didn't use a lock, but we didn't break up." 
What's the reason for these locks? 
That you'll always stay together. 
But we don't need this. 
Guys always talk like that. 
Nobody actually needs one. 
You should still do it. 
What's the point of that stuff? 
We'll be together forever anyway. 
Do you want to leave me? 
- No, right? / - I might. 
(Flustered) 
Really? I can't live without you. 
How could I live without you? 
Just live your life freely. 
That's so funny. 
It's so obvious you didn't mean any of that. 
"Just live your life freely!" 
She didn't mean that. 
(Making hearts with her fingers for the photos) 
(They take a photo together) 
We haven't had a date like that in forever. 
It's nice to spend time like that from time to time. 
(They met when they were young) 
(Just like at their honeymoon 17 years ago) 
A photo from your honeymoon. 
- It's like watching an old drama. / - Yeah! 
(They're still very much in love with each other) 
My husband is the love of my life. 
My one and only husband. 
She had my children... 
She even took care of my dad. 
Now she hosts the memorial ceremonies. 
She's even loving to my brother. 
I'm really thankful for my wife. 
She might be small, but she has a big heart. 
As big as a giant. 
It's nice to see them so physically affectionate. 
(That evening) 
(Looks like there's going to be a barbecue party) 
What is this? A barbecue? 
I thought they'd go on a date and get pasta. 
(Fresh oysters) 
(Four guys huddled together in the front yard) 
That stuff tastes better than spaghetti. 
It's the best. 
What is he wearing? 
From the smoke... 
It stings your eyes. 
(The smoke can't get to you with this) 
I thought they added it with CG. 
We went there when she was 8 to 9 months... 
- Pregnant with Pyeongjeong. / - Really? 
Before you were born. 
Hwamok was this big and Pyeonghwa was this big. 
It's been so long since we've been there. 
Pyeonghwa was so young then. 
Going there reminded me of the past. 
You could've had more nice memories if you 
traveled more instead of working so much, dad. 
As you know, I have to take care of the cows. 
The cows. 
I can't go anywhere because of the cows. 
But your dad promised me 
that we'd go on a date once a month. 
But we'll see what happens in a month. 
Was it fun learning new things, dear? 
If I study hard, I can find a different job. 
What'll you do if I find another job, son? 
You graduated college. You're definitely capable. 
(Touched) 
- How nice... / - Such nice words. 
I'll look into it more. 
I'm going to study hard. 
Just you wait. 
Mom, don't let failure get you down. 
Success is always nearby, 
but we just can't find it. 
Who said that? Who was that? 
- Hwamok? / - Hwamok. 
My gosh... He's so mature. 
He's like a guru. 
Is he Laozi? 
You're such a good son. 
Didn't you look that up? 
No. 
Let's encourage your mom... 
- Dad's crying! / - Tell her you love her. 
I love you, Pyeongjeong. 
On the count of 3. 1, 2, 3. 
- Mommy, I love you! / - I love you, mom. 
So deep. 
(Smooch) 
I love you. 
Mom, we love you. 
Mommy, I love you. 
Your mom's been working really hard. 
- So let's all encourage her. / - Thank you so much. 
(Nohwado is at the end of the Korean peninsula) 
(There's a sweet family living there) 
(We'll be rooting for their future) 
How nice. 
What a nice family. 
That was so sweet. 
I got choked up. That was touching. 
- Seeing them all together at the end... / - So envious. 
- You raised such great boys. / - Yeah. 
You guys don't have any concerns. 
That was quite the sight. 
The kids encouraging their mother. 
That's uncommon. 
Yeah... 
How did it feel when your sons encouraged you? 
I felt so happy. 
My sons are my entire life. 
Now that you've been married for 17 years... 
Who do you love more? Your husband or your sons? 
What do I say? 
I love them all. They're all on my side. 
So I love them all. 
To me, my wife is the best. 
(Wow) 
I'm so thankful and happy that you're my wife. 
That's amazing. How nice. 
You raised 3 healthy boys. 
You didn't let them get sick. 
I'm thankful for everything that you do. 
And I'll try harder to treat you better. 
Okay. 
Serin, how about saying a few words 
to your 3 reliable sons? 
I hope my sons stay healthy. 
I hope they can always smile like they do now. 
You should flash your mom a heart 
after she said all that. 
Guys are so gruff. 
Tell your parents that you love them. 
(Romanticism runs in the family) 
(I'm so happy) 
- How sweet. / - So sweet. 
Living on an island is hard. 
They have so much work to do. 
They're busy with so much work, 
yet this family is so considerate to each other 
and they're always saying how they love each other. 
They're like a model family. 
I was holding back my tears. 
I'm so envious of this family. 
I was unsure about being on this show at first. 
But now that we did it, 
this will be a nice memory for the family. 
I think this is going to recharge us 
so that we can make a new start. 
So I'd like to truly thank you all. 
Thank you. 
(We should thank you) 
I'd like to thank this family of 5 
for being on our show today. 
I hope we hear some good news from you guys. 
We'll visit Nohwado too. 
Let's all go together. 
In the summer. 
You should visit. 
We'll be back again next episode. 
That's our show for today. 
- Good-bye. / - Good-bye. 
1, 2, 3.
