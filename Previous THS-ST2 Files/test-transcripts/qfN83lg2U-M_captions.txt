you know have a baby have it born in the
philippines and it's a filipino
foreigners cannot own properties in the
philippines we
do have the possibility to become
filipino citizens we found actually a
property that we
really really love but we're just going
to pull the trigger and do it
[Music]
[Music]
what a beautiful wavy day in la onion
the philippines today we're here in san
juan at keene beach to grab
a very very late breakfast day i say
lunch it's like half past
12 in the afternoon already we arrived
here in san juan yesterday
around very late very late and i only
got to sleep at about
one o'clock in the morning so i really
had a long sleep
in today recuperated uh then edited the
vlog for you guys and now we came out
for
some lunch and to organize ourselves
some surfboards
i don't think we had any meetings today
so we will have the opportunity
to go out and surf late in the afternoon
and then
um from tomorrow out we're gonna go
surfing
every day in the morning uh as long as
there are waves but i think the hours
right now
it's so good to be back it's so so good
to be back
all right guys we had the chillest
hangout session here
at clean beach and now we're super
excited because
because now we're meeting somebody we're
meeting somebody yeah we'll keep it
we'll keep it a secret it's going to be
a secret who we're meeting
well we're going to tell you in like
five minutes but it's a secret i don't
know
yeah we're gonna meet them now i don't
know if we are going to share it on the
blog yet
so that was a very pretty property that
we saw and now we are on our way
a little bit further away from san juan
and
a little bit into the mountains but it's
different mountains than
what we have visited so far because the
mountains we saw before
there were in bhagnotan like to the back
of the
of the or like away from the beach it's
hard to explain
but this is more kind of like a hill
that's reaching out to the ocean
lost my sense of direction a little bit
already but yeah this area is
super super pretty as well lush green
rolling hills cows everywhere
very very nice and something that we
realized immediately
is that everything is super lush since
our last visit and we were here four
weeks ago five weeks ago
not even and i think it just started
raining
after we uh left yeah we are
surrounded by greens
okay so we just stepped out of the car
and
are hiking up a hill that is overlooking
the ocean
but yeah we just opened the window of
the car and
the air here is so fresh so good
it's very quiet
[Music]
look how steep here we go
yeah sorry i got flip-flops on hello
how are you my friends
so this property here has a stunning
stunning view
of the ocean right back here i don't
know if you can see it
it's very very quiet we have some cars
back there beautiful big mango tree
over there you can see beautiful
the ocean line all the way over here so
nice
we are in la nyon looking for a dream
location for a house to build here in
the province and today
we are back with randy hi how are you
who is he's this
us some amazing properties today again
and nellie's here
nelly's here and nellie's always here of
course the star of the show
but we have been getting a lot of
questions of the whole process like how
foreigners can actually even buy or own
land here in the philippines and
we wanted to talk about it in today's
vlog because all of the vlogs that we
published about
viewing properties have uh were filmed
in one go and then published over
several
several days weeks yeah and hence we
didn't have the opportunity to explain
it in the video how it really worked
been replying to some comments but yeah
today we want to address it
what is this pavilion wow
that looks so cool
[Music]
so to address the plethora of questions
that we got on our past videos
concerning how
we can actually buy land as foreigners
i'm guessing it was a little bit of a
miscommunication on our end as well
randy can clarify it a little bit more
in detail but basically
this uh come here around did it yeah
hi randy um as we found out there's two
possibilities for foreigners
at this point in time for foreigners to
uh
to get come in possession i'd say of
land um
or inhabit land whatever the best term
is the one is uh to find a filipino
partner
that with whom you start a company and
60
of the company has to be filipino owned
that is korea so then the the company is
is considered a domestic company and it
can own
land and hence as a foreign you own
forty percent and that is one of the
possibilities for us as we have
a friend a partner that is looking into
buying land as well he's a local
philippine also
that would be option one for us the
second option
which is to do a long-term lease correct
so basically you have the purchase price
of the land
and you pay the land in full and in
return you get a lease agreement for
50 years correct extendable by
25 25. one time 25 or 2 times 25.
um we really have to check that out but
standard it's
25 extension so what happens after the
75 years in total
it pretty much can be related to the
guys that own condominiums in manila
right
the condominium all of you jointly
own the land that the condominium is
erected on
and what you particularly own is a
condominium title
that pretty much gives you ownership of
the building
part of it right and that creates an
association a condom
homeowners association which is a
corporation that's standing in
philippine law for 50 years
that can be extended so after that
extension
you guys need to sit down and decide if
you are going to
demolish the building and build
something new or if you're going to
just continue with it right it really
has to be assessed so
same also can be applied to
uh long-term leases same can be applied
to what you guys are
trying to do in purchasing uh outright
you are correct foreigners cannot own
properties in the philippines
that's a standing law okay yes but there
are ways
for you to be able to go come into
possession of a property or
utilize or live on the property so
you're correct
we can do a long term lease fifty years
extend it okay
um we can get and all of this has to be
verified by a lawyer right i'm just
advising practical advices right here
but the best thing
is that it still goes through a lawyer
so consult your lawyers
yes guys
so um 75 years is kind of like the
long-term leasing
75 years doesn't mean it doesn't matter
how much and guy is
eat in 20 in 75 years i'm going to be
dead
i'm not going to sugarcoat it but let's
say after
25 years i want to sell the property
it's possible right yes so if you have a
long-term lease
as a foreigner there are several
documents that we can put in place
to create additional safeguards for you
and then we could also include spas
special power of authorities
so those documents are then going to
enable you basically to sell it to the
next person
yeah right so um again
you cannot own properties but there are
several documents that a lawyer can
draft up
for us to safeguard your interest in the
property when you purchase it
right and then that's going to enable
you to sell it to the next person
eventually so you know there were so
many uh
questions and also suggestions but there
are uh ways
we are clear our names will never be on
the title of the property
um never say never i mean if we
live long enough in the philippines then
we we do have the possibility to become
filipino citizens
that kind of changes the whole the whole
game other other recommendations that
people said is
you know have a baby have it born in the
philippines and it's a
find your filipino property right again
there are exceptions to that
i think it's very particular but it was
a fun it was a funny
example yeah a lot of things that that
we read were
all you know you can just use a dummy or
you can do this so you could do that
it's not gonna happen we can't do
anything you know
shady or illegal we have to do
everything buy the book buy the tea
uh because a lot of people watch our
vlogs so yeah of course
you can rest because we don't do you can
rest assured that everything will be
done with a professional lawyer and with
professional real estate brokers to come
to a solution that will
set us up with a nice property for life
and that's really one
yeah yeah always consult your real
estate professionals
yeah make sure that they know that what
they are doing
when you purchase properties make sure
you ask for their license
always have them identify themselves and
then make sure that you work with the
proper individuals so that your
hard-earned money will be invested and
will not go to
waste right so are there any i would say
scams where people just try to sell
property that doesn't belong to them
or i think plenty i think there's plenty
of scams like that
unfortunately again the real estate
industry in the philippines has been
professionalized just
recently in the recent years like right
now
for you to become a real estate broker
you'll have to undergo a college degree
bachelor of science in real estate
management
but of course real estate transactions
have been active
for hundreds of years already but real
professionals that handle those
transactions that are able to safeguard
interests of buyers and sellers all i
like
haven't been trained for that long yeah
right now
okay so scams that are really active
right now is
there's a lot of individuals that sell
properties that are really not
theirs yeah i saw a few really good
properties on facebook marketplace right
i also heard there are a lot of tricycle
drivers who would give a
advice that is correct actually we
brokers utilize those avenues as well
but the tricycle drivers of course
they're not learned in that particular
field so we utilize them as tipsters or
referrers
but all of the work should still be done
by your real estate professional people
can ask locals yes look what's the
situation here how does it look like and
then they can
refer a real estate agent or just so pro
tip
if you are planning to purchase a real
estate property
the first person you should ask is the
aling that sells at the sarisari store
protest we asked um kiddo at the coffee
shop exactly yeah
our go-to yeah so for us the steps are
to summarize it is
we are going to find a property that is
to our likings then
depending on the size of it we'll either
go down the avenue with the corporation
and do it
with a local partner who actually also
wants to own land so it's a perfect
match
if it's smaller we're gonna go with a
long-term lease
then we'll go into a property surveyor
and
do an appraisal of the property and then
we'll have a lawyer set up all the
documents so it's really step by step
this is not an overnight thing that's
going to happen yeah
it'll take some time but that's the
adventure that's the journey you know
that's that's what you want
again right have your property surveyed
yeah prior to putting down
any money have them surveyed you can
make a reservation agreement or anything
but
for you to really secure your interests
have them surveyed by a professional
surveyor
that knows what they are doing that's
also what i recommend
us us brokers we work with other real
estate professionals we work with
surveyors
we work with the local government unit
and we work with lawyers we don't draft
the contracts ourselves
and i think we mentioned it on the vlog
a few weeks ago
we found actually a property that we
really really loved
but it's not for sale it's too big well
it's it is
like one portion of it so yeah not every
land that you
like or see will be for sale
unfortunately there are so many
beautiful spots here
um so this is going to be an ongoing
process
uh of months i would say yeah so we'll
keep you we'll keep you guys
updated uh we'll come here every few
weeks to check out
properties that are on the market and
then hopefully fall in love with one
that matches all
boxes okay all right coffee coffee it is
