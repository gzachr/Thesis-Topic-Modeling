[Music]
and
who here enjoys horror
movies i have to admit that i do
okay i don't enjoy the horror movies
that
are based on just blood you know like
the for example the saw movies i did
enjoy the first one
because it had also a psychological
aspect to it you know but all the others
it was just for blood
the horror movies that get to me
are the ones with uh spirits
ghosts exorcism you know in that
realm and you know as much
as i get scared like seriously after i
watch a movie like that even even if
it's bad
i spend a horrible night the night i
watch it
you know but i don't know why is i just
find it fascinating
and in algeria where i grew up you know
we do believe in that crap
that's the thing and i've been told by
filipinos that
you guys also believe in that stuff and
you believe in a lot of weird creatures
and that is why today i was super
excited to react to this
video i haven't been excited to react to
a video like this
in a long time so this video is called
ten mythical creatures in the
philippines
part one i am so
excited to see what creatures
what what mythical creatures filipinos
uh i guess invented or
believe in you know um
yeah so there you go but before we start
please consider follow me on instagram
at music
game news and and if you
uh enjoy horror movies even if you don't
let me know in the comment section below
which is
your favorite horror movie when i say
favorite is the movie that scared the
crap
out of you you know and in my case
is the exorcist the first one the old
one you know with the girl that turns
her head and everything
i watched it i didn't sleep for a week i
was even afraid to go to the bathroom
you know like bruh it was just too much
so yeah i'm counting on you to tell me
in the comment section
all right without further ado let's get
to it
the philippines has a large variety of
mythical creatures especially in the
countryside
rural areas
most of filipinos believe that they
exist despite the fact that there is no
scientific evidence for any of these
creatures see that's why i said
uh the creatures that filipinos believe
in you know or invented in a way
philippine myths still have an active
role in the lives of rural filipinos and
the countless myths circulating
throughout the filipino countryside
contain a large variety of mythical
creatures
you know it's these types of creatures
that you make that you can make
good movies about
look at that creature man
to this day the mythical beings still
play an active role in the lives of many
filipinos and sometimes used to scare
children yeah
my dad used to tell me stories like this
to scare us
the real facts presents
10 mythical creatures in the philippines
duende
when they are goblins hobgoblins elves
or dwarves
these are creatures that play a certain
amount of mischief
on humans though from time to time they
are also considered
house guardians oh it's like in harry
potter
with dobby
they live in small hills that look like
ant hills
big trees like nara and abandoned houses
they become scary if someone will
destroy their home and punish the
culprit with the myriad
of ailments such as swelling or vomiting
and also
curse hence the phrase tabitabi po
is usually used to pay respect to their
presence okay i'll remember that if i go
to
the to the rural areas of the
philippines
is he throwing up
filipinos would leave food on the floor
so that the duende
residing or guarding the house would not
be angry with them
yeesh okay
they also take your things and laugh at
you when you try to find it they give it
back when they feel like it or when you
tell them to please give it
okay
okay well those are not very scary doing
this
half man and half horse creature it has
a horse's head
the body of a human but with the feet
of the horse okay so it's the opposite
of what we see in hollywood movies where
it's usually
the head and upper body of a man but the
bottom
of a horse okay
damn that looks scary
it travels at night to rape female
mortals
holy the raped women will then give
birth to mortic balance
[Music]
so it's a horny demon
they are also believed to cause
travelers to lose their particularly
their way particularly in mountainous or
forced areas okay thick balance are very
playful with people and they usually
make a person imagine things that are
that aren't real sometimes i think about
angle will drive a person crazy
we've seen these type of demons in
movies right that do
these types of tricks
this is counteracted by wearing one's
shirt
inside out another counter measure is to
ask permission out loud to pass by
or not to produce too much noise while
in the woods in order not to offend or
disturb the thick balance okay
by one account a tick by line has a main
of sharp spines with the ch with the
three
thickest of these being of particular
importance a person who obtains one of
these spines can use them as an
and ting anting anting
talisman in order to keep the tick
balance as his servant
wow bro that is power
they have three golden hairs and if you
pluck three of them before he slash she
eats you
they will serve you until you die well
there you go
that is the solution
they become like your genie basically
your humble servant
that can fly after separating itself
from the lower half of its body
what it eats babies
and fetuses from a mother's womb
it eats babies by means of passing their
long tongue through a
small hole from the roof of a house holy
that is disturbing
there the sharp end of the tongue
touches the mother's
navel to suck the blood of the fetus or
unborn child
who comes up with creatures like this
man
this creature's name was derived from
the filipino word the tangal
which means to separate because of the
amananga's ability to separate itself
from its lower body
but why would it do that why would it
even separate itself from its lower body
does doesn't have a purpose like it
reminds me of lizards
you know when you catch the lizard's
tail it separates it
from its body willingly right so maybe
it's a way for this creature to escape
can also be a sorceress that visits
villagers and
barrios to feed the self-segmented
chooses an isolated place where she will
leave her lower torso
while she hunts at night when she
separates from her lower torso she
then gains her ability to fly
oh lower torso just torso
so as soon as she separates from the
her the bottom of her body she
skin she can fly okay so i guess it has
a purpose
sunlight is deadly to the manananggal
when she is in her
monstrous form should her two have still
be separate with the coming of dawn she
will be destroyed
okay okay okay okay and now i understand
better so i think
they just didn't explain it very well so
i think uh
this is like a woman okay that
is cut in half when she transforms okay
into a monster and she uh her
her wings appear when she transforms and
is cut in half
okay so she's also like a vampire
because she cannot survive
the sunlight
according to legends to destroy the
manananggal one should search for the
lower torso that she leaves behind
during her nightly hunts
salt ash or garlic should then be placed
on the exposed flesh preventing the
monster from combining again and leaving
it vulnerable to sunlight oh
yo you gotta make a movie about this
this one is super interesting
uh see garlic just like vampires
wow this one is so scary
caprese
the capri is a demon tree but with more
human characteristics they are giants
with glowing red
eyes sharp teeth very long fingernails
huge trunk
like legs brown hair and usually have a
beard
they are as tall as seven to nine feet
okay
are they like ogres
another characteristic of this monster
is that they love to
smoke a big ganja pipe well this one is
the best
that never burns out and it's believed
that the smell of it would attract human
attention oh
my god the imagination
imagination man that's awesome
ganja bye
they like to wear indigenous northern
philippine clothes
called a bahaga and a belt that can make
him
invisible
wow that one is creepy
unlike most of filipino monsters they
are not evil oh okay
or like to eat people or fetuses they
just enjoy to scare children that like
to stay late at night
also love to indulge in humans vices
like gambling drinking and smoking okay
okay
some myths say that he always carries a
beautiful white stone and if you manage
to obtain it he will grant you
wishes another interesting thing is that
if you become friends with him you will
be able to see it and if you see it
if you sit on it the rest of the people
will see it as well
what yo so it's it's also like a genie
so
oh my goodness this image will haunt me
forever
is this kobe bryant kobe bryant ring
because you know kobe bryant is called
the mamba the black mamba
mamba barang yaish so
freaking scary the mamba barang is the
filipino version
of a sorcerer and the name is derived
from the word
barang the verb paragon or
means to place a hex a curse in filipino
is a sumpah
they are ordinary human beings with
black magical torture and later kill
their victims by
infesting their bodies with insects
[Music]
i really really really really don't like
insects and that's one
of the many reasons why i don't see
myself
living in algeria again for example
because in algeria there are a lot of
insects and they get into your house
okay here in canada it's very
very very rare that you see insects in
the house especially in my house okay
uh because winter is harsh and they
cannot survive winter
and that's fantastic and i hate uh
mosquitoes
mosquitoes above all else because
[Music]
they can't let you sleep you know i just
hate mosquitoes
and there are none here during summer
time there are
you know but i keep my windows closed
and even if i open them
there is the uh the the the
you know the mosquito uh what do you
call it like
um the mosquito net yes that
doesn't let them get in so wonderful
they use a strand of hair from their
chosen victim and
tie it to the bugs or worms which they
will use as a
medium when they pick the bug the victim
immediately experiences the intended
effect
oh okay so basically
the person become the victim becomes the
bug in a way
yeah so the victim and the bug become
one
they're tied
the mamba badan keeps his beetles in a
bottle or a section of bamboo carefully
feeding them ginger root
these demons remind me of the monsters
and demons that
that you encounter in the video game the
witcher
when the practitioner decides to employ
his dark art he performs a prayer ritual
wherein he whispers
instructions and identifies the victim
to the beatles
oh looks like a dragon bakunawa is a
dragon in philippine mythology that is
often represented as a gigantic
sea serpent it is believed to be the
cause of eclipses
it is believed that he or she was just
turned into a dragon as
punishment wow this one reminds me of
the
large large serpent from the video game
the last
god of war video game
fairy in the sea uh some say she was a
naga and was the most powerful one night
she saw the seven
moon and was captivated by their beauty
and longed to possess them
it appears as a giant sea serpent with a
mouth
the size of a lake a red tongue whiskers
gills small wires at its sides
and two sets of wings one is large and
ash gray while the other is small and is
found
further down its body
tales about the bohanawa say that it is
the cause of
eclipses the bukhana were amazed by
their beauty would rise from the ocean
and swallow the moon's whole
angering but hala and causing them
to be mortal enemies so but allah is god
oh my god they look horrifying
what the hell are these uh
tiana are babies who died before
receiving baptism rights
after death they go to a place known as
limbo
a chamber of hell which unbaptized dead
people fall into
and are transformed into evil spirits oh
god
these phantasms return into the mortal
realm
in the form of goblins to eat living
victims
the tiana can also be the offspring of a
woman
and a demon it can also be an aborted
fetus which comes back to take revenge
on its mother oh my god this
is just disturbing and dark
nasty
man people have crazy imagination
most tianaks are said to live in forests
if they see a human they transform into
what looks like a normal baby
oh damn
when the person notices the tiana and
comes near to take a look at it the
tiana changes back
to its true form and eats its prey
santelmo
the mangalyo or santilmu appears in the
form of a ball of fire
okay the term santelmo is the shortened
form of the tagalog word apoy
nissan elmo saint elmo's fire
okay
for other countries it is like a wisp an
atmospheric ghost
light seen by travelers at night
especially over bugs
swamps or marshes
doesn't seem too scary saint elmo's
fires have ranged from a ghostly dancing
flame to natural fireworks the flame is
heatless and non-consuming occasionally
accompanied by a hissing sound
okay that's a an odd mythical creature
seems okay doesn't seem too dangerous it
was
scientifically explained as electric
fields which have diverged from the
lines however
the sightings were reported since the
spanish era
yeah that one is okay
monk
sorcerers who cast evil spells to humans
this bewitcher is also called
mangagawai the mango golem uses dark
magic
resembles the other one that we i was
like number five i think
the difference between a mamba barang
there you go the mamba barang
and a mangkukulam is that the mamba
barang uses magical insects to bring
harm to his victims true
khulam is a form of folk magic
practiced in the philippines it puts
emphasis on the innate power of the self
and a secret knowledge of magicka baja
or low magic
earth soil fire herbs
spices candles oils and kitsch
kitchen wares and utensils are often
used for rituals
charm spells and portion potions
okay well this is just like a regular
sorcerer
a witch primary methods employed by a
mango lamb are candle lighting ritual uh
scrying or towers recitation of spells
and concocting potions yeah yeah it's
the usual
wedge that you see in movies
modern popular cultural culture also
depicts the
as using either photographs or the
equivalent of a voodoo doll yeah
all right number ten
best for last aswang looks like
a werewolf
oh us ones are shape shifters they are
human-like
by day but transform into different
monstrous forms to harass and eat
awake humans at night or day
or day they can't eat during daytime
because
you know there you have the human shape
especially pregnant women who are about
to give birth
there's a lot of creatures here that
enjoy eating
either pregnant women or their babies
aswangs can change form from a human
into an animal form usually as a big
black bird with a long
tongue tiktik as uh
a half bodied monster mana nangal
as a bat a cat a pig or a black dog
right they did not mention a wolf
so it cannot be a werewolf
but it's the same principle because you
know werewolves are
essentially humans that transform into
big wolves
at night
us ones appear at night rarely during
the day
to prey upon unwary travelers or
sleeping people it is said that they
have a peculiar
liking for the taste of human liver
also have peculiar liking for the fetus
of pregnant women and are said to find
their quarry
by the scent of the mother which to the
aswang smells like
ripe jackfruit
oh man that is one disturbing picture
it gives me chills upon fighting the
house of the pregnant mother the tick
tick
lights on the roof from where it
stretches its tongue
until it is as thin as a thread and uses
it to enter the boom and feeds on the
fetus
well this is kind of the same concept as
the
uh you know woman that transforms into
this
creature with wings with long tongue and
splits
you know from the bottom half of her
body to eat fetuses like that
all right well the thing is a lot of
these
creatures seem to share similarities you
know
same uh attributes if you will you know
um so it really sounds like
this is coming from the imagination of
filipinos you know and that
obviously it does you know it's not like
they actually saw this stuff
but it's still very interesting and the
ones that really scared me
is the woman that you know splits in
half
and eats babies or fetuses and
the kids the ugly babies you know that
look like babies and then they transform
into monsters and eat
their victims ugh that is just
disturbing
but for sure uh there is potential here
to make some very disturbing
movies that will prevent me from
sleeping at night
um also what are your
irrational fears you know like
i'm scared of whales for example
you know it just scares me to know that
i could be in the sea
and a massive massive animal
can just be in the same area as i am
and could kill me by just flicking me
like this
you know that is one irrational or
irrational fear of mine
i also don't like insects i mean i'm
used to them
you know i live with them i killed a
bunch i guess when i was younger
you know i killed the occasional spider
let's be honest we've all done it and uh
yeah but i still don't like insects i
also don't like snakes even though when
i was a kid
i did uh hold the snake in my arms and
around my neck and everything it is the
weirdest feeling ever
so yeah i'd like to know what your
irrational fear
fears are and uh
yeah tell me what you thought about this
video
take care of yourselves have a great day
stay safe and i will see you
in the next one
