welcome to another takeout thursday
what is up guys welcome to another vlog
today
as you can see we are doing a filipino
food
take out thursday mukbang style a few
days ago
someone told us that we have to try this
filipino food that is by son miguel
right there's like a san miguel store
where you can order them online we'll
put the link in the description down
below
but we have a ton of food here we're a
little bit disappointed in ourselves
that we haven't done
a lot of filipino
filipino food in the last uh few weeks
we only did the electron worm right
in the past so we wanted to do like a
crazy filipino food mukbang and
should i go through what dishes we have
okay um so we're trying to keep it
healthy
guys uh we have some rice substitute
which is called adlam i believe
it's something here from the philippines
which looks like uh in german we call it
hilde
yeah yeah very interesting so um as you
all know we're doing our one meal a day
um diet at the moment so it's okay we're
eating once
today and we need to get on all our
calories of the day so let's go through
it we have
over here karakara yes then we have
chicharron i believe it is
then here we have beef steak yes
chicken karage technically not filipino
but chicken karage
we have letronpaksif yes chicken adobo
and kombi yes
so like a an amazing spring i wanted to
uh go to tagathai because tagatay opened
up for tourists and he just wanted to go
to his favorite breakfast restaurant to
have some
uh balai dako very soon very soon
sorry i'm so hungry i can't think
anymore
okay so i think we should start with the
starters which is the chicharron
bulaclam okay and the chicken carragher
okay
so i will just grab one of these okay
see we don't have any dipping
vinegar
it's okay just try it like this okay
we'll try it without dipping vinegar
crispy on the outside nice and chewy on
the inside
that's very chewy yeah
oh i know what this is
i think this is some kind of chicken
liver
pork something like that
not bad that's quite nice yeah
so moving on to the uh that's nice
actually would have been nice with
vinegar
i think i'll get some vinegar so moving
on to the chicken karage
and i made us just like a little bit of
a chili mayo here
we can dip into sorry very mild
chili because nelly doesn't like spicy
at the moment
all right enjoy
crunchy juicy
it's not bad that's really good
considering
we just took it out of the freezer and
deep fried it
all of these dishes come pre-packed
and you just have to heat it up so it
was super easy for us just to
put it on the stove yeah or put it in
the oven and
it's done there's no cooking involved
yeah just warming it up
filipino food needs a lot of time and
love
and effort to prepare and
i think if we would have prepared this
it would have taken
all day at least yeah so i'm really
happy we just
you know yeah this is good really good
all right how should we why we're so
formal today
so guys i have been dreaming
about this food all day i have been
let me say fantasizing about eating
that's one of the things with this
omad diet you think of food constantly
because you're not eating you can't go
on youtube you can't go on instagram you
can't go on facebook because
i'm gonna watch all my food videos after
we eat here
yeah and you just gotta i mean it's it's
not do you wanna try the curry curry
first
uh yeah okay um we're not we i wasn't
really hungry today
i was just thinking about food all the
time thank you
which uh that's enough yeah which is uh
complicated if you're supposed to be
thinking about work yeah and
i will say when we started heating up
all this food here in the apartment it
started smelling so
amazing in here and it's it's a torture
it's a torture when you're hungry and
you just uh
okay here we go caricare i can smell the
peanut
already yeah really nice
we actually need shrimp paste yeah we
don't have shrimp paste
we haven't found a shrimp paste that we
like hundred percent so if you have any
recommendations for us comment down
below
if you have any preferred brands or
small businesses let us know
oh this is delicious creamy peanuty very
flavorful
okay the peanut flavor is not as strong
well it's there for sure but it's not
like hitting me in the face
it's nice i like it
comfort food yeah i want to try the beef
bee stick
next all right the foods are very
saucy deeply stick here we go
hmm that is just like
it's almost like a british stew mm-hmm
right i just wanted to say like an
austrian goulash without the paprika
yeah paprika powder
oh i like beef bee steak yeah that's
good
that's very western very european yeah
it reminds me of some of a dish that my
mom used to make for me
this is really good such deep rich
flavors
love it okay
what are we having next i think we
should try the uh
corned beef why are we battling with
corned beef today do you think of that i
don't know how we
just it's so hard to focus when you're
on a diet
all right
look at that when it comes to corned
beef i always like to
get a big chunky piece but then also
i like to get the flaky flaky pieces
that kind of fall off
that are nice and saucy
hmm that's quite good it's nice and
delicate yeah
it falls apart it's super tender not too
salty
i like it this is actually
really nice i think corned beef is
brined
right yeah wow
the only thing that i could think of to
add is some kind of like
um like a horseradish radish sauce
but it tastes juicy without anything
wow this is something that i can eat
without feeling guilty
i keep coming back to this chicken
karaga
yum
this is the lightning box yes okay so
last time when we ate the
um latron uh we got so so many comments
of you guys
what to do with the leftovers and a lot
of you guys said
the one thing that you could do is to
make lechon paksif
yes which is the leftover
in a kind of a stew yeah it's um the
pork meat
i think it's the monk thomas kind of
sauce if i'm not mistaken
like it's used to make this and
last time we can get around to do this
because we pretty much ate the whole
electron
we used a little bit for that's why we
on a diet now
we made a fried rice i think what we had
left yeah
very sweet a lot of spices no it's not
very sweet it's it's like
sweet ish yeah on the sweet side but
without being
too sweet what is in there what is um
low bear bay leaf bay leaf i think bay
leaves
i can taste bay leaves yeah for me the
caricar is winning right now yeah i
am definitely okay one of my
top dishes in the philippines adobo
in this case we have some chicken adobo
and if you have never been to the
philippines and you want to
try some filipino food go with the adobo
you can't
go wrong with that yes but i will say i
will say a lot of people come to the
philippines
believe that filipino food is mainly
adorable and latron
there's so much more it's so playlist
of all the food vlogs that we did on the
philippines i think we already did
over 100 yeah and also like regional
foods
yeah so you have bacolod food which is
amazing oh my god i love the colored
food you have
how do you like the food in mindanao you
have completely different food and
because
there's like so many different cuisines
with so many different dishes and i
think even
uh southern mineral food yes even if you
look at adobo there's so many different
types of adorable depending on where you
go in the philippines so it's so diverse
comment down below if you are filipino
and you believe that your region
has the best food comment the region
down below
and once the uh corinthian is lifted
we'll travel there
and from a few
all food videos give this a try
very tender mmm i can taste some vinegar
also a lot of
spices a lot of flavor
oh i i think this was cooking for a long
time something
in all honesty that i can't um get used
to
is the chicken pieces come usually with
bones inside
so it's a little bit difficult to have
the saucy thing and then it's
kind of but i think it's it's also very
filipino thing to have
like the small bones in asia in general
like also with other cuisines in asia
yeah um i think that people love to have
the bones in the okay
this was really nice this was really
really nice for
cooking at home we found some favorites
right yeah definitely
so if i can go through it like my top um
like the the two starters were really
really good loved it
the caricare like from the saucy ones i
love the karakara the most
okay and then obviously like the corned
beef is so so
so good okay guys i know you see a lot
of food here
there's also more food in the kitchen
because the packaging is quite big for
these foods that we had here um luckily
we have
a ton of containers from take out food
from different take off thursdays
yeah and what we're gonna do now is
we're going to portion
whatever food we have left we're going
to put in containers because there's a
courtesy desk
at our lobby so it's for the staff that
works in the building because i know
a lot of people have been hit by this
pandemic and a lot of families
so the people have some food to take
with home to share with families so
this is not gonna go to waste yes uh we
filled up our bellies as far as we
pretty much can
yeah and everything that we had here
we'll just uh put it in the fridge
for tomorrow yeah oh let me let me tell
you my favorites
yes my favorites were definitely um
between these two
the beef bee stick and the corned beef
super super delicious
this one was a little bit too oily but i
think the
the oil was not too it wasn't hot enough
but it was hot enough my mistake that
was your mistake
[Laughter]
um i really like the chicken karage
i also enjoyed this rice the
nice alternative from the philippines
and tomorrow we can make kind of like a
stir fry with that as well
yeah that is like overall pretty good
and there's something else guys
so here's a fun little story um i think
every
day we get quite a few messages of
people wanting to
send us some goodies some baked goods
some sweets some food
and nelly was like mike stop saying yes
to people
we can't eat this much food so
i had a message from one of you guys and
it was such
such a nice cute message so i was like
peanut is eating the
paper towels i just couldn't say no
and then nelly says like i said oh nelly
we're getting something
something nice to eat and then we
figured out that yeah we both have
gotten the message
nelly was the reasonable person said
we're on a diet uh we can't
