saw Morissette I mean we were just we
just watched her show and we were so
starstruck because you just hear

just it was surreal being able to you
know just get a picture and she was she
knew who we were right and that was that
was the coolest thing like she when she
saw she immediately knew who we were one
of the craziest experiences for me was
just being on her wish bus and that's I
feel like that's because like thinking
about heart power channel got started
doing reaction videos and seeing all
these great artists like perform on the
wish of us it was just crazy to like be
on the other side of the screen just
being interviewed it was just like a
surreal experience that I'll never
forget so glad we documented it but that
was crazy to do it with Shay another one
of the most favorite parts of our trip
was see Katrina Velarde and it didn't
surprise me that she was such an amazing
singer it did surprise me that she was
even better live like it's almost ten
times better live I don't know why
she's such a good performer just a
combination of like herb and her
vocalist the song selection all this
thing all the songs she sang on her set
were amazing and we got to talk to her
