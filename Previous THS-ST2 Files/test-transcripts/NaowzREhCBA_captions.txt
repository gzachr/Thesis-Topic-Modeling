this is me verdi i'm back again today
i'm gonna be reacting to geography now
philippines
i'm gonna get to know a little bit more
about the philippines
and yeah let's just get started and
watch this we don't have to waste too
much time
let go
ah there's no captions i know like
i can understand english but sometimes
oh this dude looks
so fast i cannot like sometimes like
get things especially names you know
voices and stuff
but anyway i'm just gonna pierce it
i'm not seeing this anymore
that's developing jolly people and you
know what
it's been three years i'm
[Applause]
okay
welcome to the philippines my turn
stop here so cute
hey everyone i'm ken and as you know i'm
half filipino years ago i was looking
for a job and i saw this ad
asking for a motion graphics animator on
craigslist paul and i literally met up
on a drawing there were only three
candidates i didn't lie
but yeah the other two people kind of
sucked so yeah oh and back then i had
this weird mustache and paul's hair
oh
you've come so far from that craigslist
the philippines is an interesting
country because there's sort of a
dichotomy between labels if you ask a
filipino if they consider themselves
asian or pacific islanders you might get
contrasting answers
exactly that's the only thing i know
about the philippines sorry
yeah i don't like it like it has oh my
gosh
i wish you can visit all of those
split amongst three nations the closest
point only about 22 miles or 40
kilometers away from the nearest island
that belongs to the philippines
now in general many people will refer to
one of the three main island cluster
regions that people are a part of there
are lassonde in the north where you can
find the capital of manila
in the center and mindanao in the south
otherwise the nation is made up of 17
regions one of which is autonomous
autonomous region of muslim media now
this place has a high level of self-rule
and autonomy appointed by the government
we'll explain more about this later if
you want to be absolutely technical
question city a bit north of manila is
the largest city in the philippines
however the surrounding 16 towns and
cities by manila are called manila metro
or the national capital region and they
basically act as one unit otherwise the
largest city outside of the ncr
are davao city in mindanao in the peace
manila illinois
airport which the entire is
they also have the busiest shipping port
at the port of manila otherwise the
second largest airport
is done international and rounding up
for third place is davao city francisco
of banggood international in terms of
land transport though the philippines is
well connected amongst the islands in
fact the longest highways the pan
philippine highway that stretches about
3 500 kilometers across the country and
connects luzon zaman lien and maven
with underground tunnels connecting them
islands is a complete mess if you don't
know anything about this place it
basically goes like this
yeah it's pretty crazy this is the map
showing what everyone clings in the area
this big one right here is china's like
yeah they just kind of pretty much went
for all of it this has even led to a few
skirmishes between nations that have
built patrol stations on the island
and when they spot a ship that gets too
close things can get kind of ugly it's
kind of like
this hey what are you doing this is my
area
so you're just gonna build your own land
for research
anyway anyways
has many historical and colonial
buildings the various national museums
of history and arts
tons of amusement park and that's not
even including all the natural
underground wonders the most amazing
chocolate
and there's an island
you should hang out sometime yeah when
you have 7 000 tropical islands on a
volcanic archipelago
chances are things can get pretty crazy
landscape-wise which brings us to
the physical land of the philippines is
the biggest treasure you will find here
for sure
anyway the philippines lies on the ring
of fire and is specifically on a
tectonic plate named after oh my gosh
this makes the country susceptible to
small earthquakes and minor volcanic
activity
about 53 active volcanoes can be found
in all of these largest islands except
for
the most famous and picturesque of these
include these three
see this island here gummy queen it
actually has more volcanoes than towns
on it seven versus five
making it the place with the most number
of volcanoes per square kilometer in the
world
in fact the tallest peak in the
philippines is a potentially active
volcano
located in the south vietnam area the
country has numerous mountain ranges and
highlands that
dip into the fertile valleys the largest
range being the cortiera range in the
north zone area
looking into the sierra madre range on
the east side which feeds the longest
river of the country the kagaya that
flows into the kagayo
it's hard to memorize like the names or
remember them i cannot like
now i can hear that
okay
and finally the country
can come at is any time of the year the
nation will experience on average about
20 of the turbulent storms annually
which often floods river systems
but yeah if anything filipinos are the
most cyclone adapted
thing people sailing fishing just not
exactly
dying oh no mega diversions on earth
they have everything from the longest
snake in the world the articulated
python the largest fish in the world in
the philippines
the world's smallest animal the
philippine mouse deer and their national
bird is the largest people in the world
economically speaking the philippines is
considered a newly industrialized nation
it is transitioning out of becoming an
agricultural based system to a service
and manufacturing phase one they have
they're one of the fastest growing
economies in asia and has the 34th
largest economy in the world their gdp
purchasing power parity has surpassed
the 2 trillion dollar market basically
the philippines is definitely becoming a
key power player in the world stage
and the second largest coconut producer
in indonesia i feel bad for that
this is like where i wanna live
not only
[Music]
i'm still gonna eat it yeah right ken
yeah that's not peanut food yeah
there's really no official national dish
but three that are well known for are
adobo lupia
and synagogue and in the non-muslim
parts that john is a huge
there are also dishes like
lemon juice
thank you for letting me know i want to
visit that i want to eat for
those are the best summertime in my
opinion they also have
what you're calling if you're either
latin american or spanish
[Music]
i will conquer the is yeah for some
reason filipinos are like the best
friends of asia filipinos still have the
best attitudes and smiles they didn't
give time off felony sentences if the
prisoners volunteered to take part in a
michael jackson
performance to the public uh but we're
getting ahead of ourselves first the
graph the country is about 110 billion
people and is the eighth most populated
country in asia and the twelfth most
populated country in the world there are
about 175
linguistic people groups in the
philippines the majority of whose
languages are austronesian of these
groups the largest ones are the tagalog
at about 28
13.
the people overseas philippines
it is one of the largest diaspora
populations in spanning over 100
countries the us
alone has about 4 million i mean they
were at one point colonized by the us so
go figure they use the filipino peso as
their currency these
types a b and c plug outlets and they
drive on the right side of the road oh
and keep in mind the word pinoy is
synonymous with something that is
filipino you might see that use a lot
now back to the company's things
well the philippines two official
languages english which makes it the
fifth most english-speaking nation on
earth and filipino which is the
standardized version of the government
the philippines spoken today is very
different from pure tagalog it actually
has about 14
spanish
just using the syllable for example
that was crazy
located in city now the philippines is
unique in that over a past few centuries
they've gone through three periods that
shaped their identity before european
intervention the philippines has had a
multitude of early civilizations that
build kingdoms and dynasties like
and many of these kingdoms had their own
indigenous writing systems such as
genetically filipinos are
cousins between the classified like the
mariana islanders guam and malawi
although over the years many people have
mixed and today it is speculated that
somewhere around one-fifth or more the
population may have some kind of chinese
ancestry after the spanish came in they
adopted many of the customs traditions
and cultural traits which have spanish
roots their own country is named after
spanish king villa the biggest trait
though would be the fact that they are
predominantly catholic at about 81
of the population adhering to the faith
the rest are mostly protestant the small
muslim minority in
the philippines is the largest christian
nation in asia fifth largest
christian nation on earth and third
largest catholics
they have so many holidays and festivals
devoted to catholic themes like all
saints day
holy week and easter and of course the
largest one
christmas the philippines has the
longest christmas season out of anywhere
else unheard okay so now we're just
gonna rapid fire
best of 12 fun cultural facts for the
philippines filipinos have a ton of
superstitions for example whistling at
night will turn you into a world for
formal occasions
too many to cover but it goes everywhere
from feathers coconut fibers
hairdressers tribal tattoos philippines
dominates major international beauty
pageants with a grand total of 15
victories at the miss universe
earth competitions basketball and boxing
are the most popular sport by far
they have the oldest basketball league
in asia and the second oldest in the
world after the united states
we all know pacquiao the philippines is
the leader i don't have my face but i
don't know he's
mean it's been said at one point every
filipino has their
should i just drop everything and become
a nurse
and a lot of people often raise the back
to the hands of their elders to their
forehead as
can tell you filipinos
yeah like i don't know like of course
they would be but like they've got
crazy amazing
[Music]
are clapped together horses cool
the philippines is beautiful but if
you've been keeping up with your events
they do have their fair share of issues
that have made headlines
here human trafficking whether in the
sex industry slavery or organ smuggling
has been a problem in certain areas and
even though anti-trafficking acts have
been passed by the government
enforcement has not always been on par
drug trade has also been a major
inconvenience for decades affecting
millions of people in the country this
has led to the new controversial laws
instituted by president duarte which
encouraged the public to seek bounty in
exchange for hunting down drug pushers
many have died in the process
and finally you have the moral conflict
an insurgency in the predominantly
muslim mindanao region which sought to
take parts of eastern malaysia and break
away through conflict the fight has been
going on for nearly half a century and
now just ending at the turn of the 21st
century
for what is worth though in the
philippines everyone is family at the
end
you don't have to be related to
to the islands oh comes in and magellan
dies in battle
five spanish dudes follow through they
finally become a colony of spain the
gallantry british philippines and then
back to spain the treaty of paris
philippine revolution the
spanish-american war
first philippine
martial law this guy gets killed because
he was against the regime
revolution in 1986
to an industrial one and here we are
today and now we finish off with the
notable famous people condensed
some famous people you guys the pinoy
geometry suggested we mentioned this
episode included
these two saints
[Music]
and all the miss universe winners and
there's a ton of americans
[Music]
it would make sense that it would have
ties with the outside world in many
different ways
the philippines is generally close with
all the asean nations and does great
business with them
particularly indonesia and malaysia
their closest neighbors the marshall
islands palau
and the federal states of micronesia are
all cousin countries many of which have
filipino migrants in them and they all
share the same history of being former
us territories and u.s influenced states
of course spain will always be in the
back of their minds as the former
colonizer that they gain
much influence from although filipinos
are not considered latino the spanish
and many latin americans kind of see
them as like the adopted
asians that totally fit in their family
it's like come on you're catholic
you eat every fifth word you speak in
spanish
interestingly enough the relationships
which for two and a half centuries
linked the philippines with mexico
across the pacific ocean making one or
two round triple wages per year between
the ports
and manila
ultimately the usa and south korea south
korea was one of their closest best
friends from the 20th century on well
once you really bonded with them after
the japanese occupation years
and they supported each other
diplomatically koreans are the top
number one tourist demographic that
visit the philippines koreans kind of
admire the fact that even though they
were both influenced by the us filipinos
speak better
[Music]
the us also had the largest number of
overseas filipinos at over four million
most of whom live
on the west coast states like hawaii and
california they are one of the oldest
asian partners of the us
they have a mutual defense treaty and
they are the largest export partner and
second largest import after china
[Music]
in conclusion if you enter a room full
of asians you definitely know who the
filipinos are
while everyone is so uptight we're the
ones in karaoke and some are salty you
can just feel the energy of a filipino
there's a touch of latin flavor i mean
like
pop undertones you can guess like i can
see like sometimes with you know people
in my country
like i just can't guess that they're
from the philippines
and i've never stopped in that like
except like some others they don't
really look like that but like
i don't know if it's a kind of
stereotype thing but i don't know like
when you watch probably a lot of asian
things
in general you start to differentiate
like when you look at someone you would
be like oh he looks like a korean he
looks like a japanese he looked like a
filipino
indonesian malaysian and indonesian
formula they look the same
and yeah so you start to
differentiate a little bit like between
asians
um for some others everyone
that belongs to asia is called the
chinese like
and i'm like dude like the anyway
but that was a really really great
episode
i really got to know a lot of things
about the philippines philippines is
a really amazing country that i also
want to visit i mean i really want to
visit
any country in the indonesia like it's
just amazing
and uh like i got like
friends from the philippines that
they're really really really
amazing they're really nice they're
really cool
and yeah so
i've enjoyed this i got to learn a lot
and even though like i cannot of course
remember like the names
of like cities or things that happened
for real but like
