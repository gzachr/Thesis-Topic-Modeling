foreign
is performing a song of his that I
really like I reacted to it and
discovered it a few months ago and it's
called G wolf okay I reacted to the
music video where the dude is on fire I
mean lyrically flow wise and even in the
music video I mean the house that he was
in or whatever got on fire okay but he
is performing it live on the wish bus
and we will be reacting to that today
and we will see if he will be able to
sustain the speed and the flow in real
life you know because when you're
recording studio you can make mistakes
and edit that in post-production you
know indeed audio software I mean I've
done that before you know what I'm
saying but when you're live you can't
mess up before we start though make sure
to follow me on Instagram at music gang
news because that is where you can DM me
your suggestions and without further Ado
let's jump right into it
ah yeah he's got red hair today okay
basically fire the color of Fire
[Music]
I mean fire is more complex than that
you know the color of it but still
usually we represent fire with red
release
[Music]
[Music]
okay let's talk about this
so when I reacted to the original song
You Know the music video I not only
enjoyed the way he wrapped on the beat
but I also really liked the beat which
is a trap hip-hop beat okay with the
classic 808
and uh hi-hats and everything
um but but but I really like the fact
that they use the strings behind for the
melody and they started the song by
reversing those strings you know so my
enjoyment of this song is you know it's
not just based on his flow and his voice
and everything but it's also based on
the beat the beat is really fire
everything about this song is fire now
let's talk about the way he is
performing on the wishbus so clearly
uh he came along no band they're not
right trying to recreate the entire song
with a band okay so basically they're
just playing the beat plus so they're
playing the original beat plus some
original vocal tracks okay like he is
not actually wrapping everything my
question is in the main vocal of his
okay is it under is it like behind what
he is actually doing here on the wish
bus you know I wonder if what we're
hearing it's the original voice of uh
flow G and his voice right here on top
of it you know so that even if he makes
a mistake here you won't be we won't
really be able to notice it because in
the background there is his voice from
the actual track just with a lower
volume you know
I know this is very technical but as a
beat maker and sound engineer I like to
talk about these things
let's keep going
[Music]
see right now it's not the strings
anymore we don't hit the strings right
now it's a Pizzicato like ding
[Music]
you know the strings are gone but they
will come back eventually
man his his uh you know flow
got much faster
[Music]
once again
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
okay so last week when I reacted to the
crowds of the Philippines that are too
much but in the best way possible
um there was a clip of a crowd singing
the famous sb19 song mapa if I'm not
mistaking mistaken and they were outside
of the wish bus and singing the song
right and we could actually see inside
of the bus the multiple cameras you know
that they used to to actually film
the artists you know you don't
necessarily pay attention to that when
you watch the official wishbus video but
here we could actually see it did you
see how many cameras uh he looked at and
they switched from camera from angle to
angle to angle to angle you know all
those cameras you can actually see them
from outside of the bus
and believe you me I will do my best to
contact the wishbus so that I can uh you
know uh make you know do a visit of the
wish bus and film it for you guys and
film everything the microphones the
cameras if if I'm allowed of course
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
oh my gosh yep he was able to handle it
live without a problem props to my boy
flow G
now would you like to know the Filipino
song that I've been listening to every
day for the past month
it's mood mood by Al Al James that song
is so good there is no official music
video for it but it's so freaking good I
actually left a comment under the lyrics
video I think and said that we needed a
music video an official music video and
a performance live in the wishbus so far
I haven't seen any you know which is
disappointing but it's such a great song
I love everything about it
but damn floji killed it here as well
and because I enjoyed the original song
so much I had to react to the wishbus
performance to confirm the awesomeness
and the skills of floji you know in real
life it'd be nice to see him also doing
it live in front of me you know what I'm
saying so yeah and he is part of course
of um ex-battalion
um there you go let me know in the
comment section below if you enjoy this
song and if you think he did a good job
uh
re-transcribing the song in a live
format it's not necessarily like super
live you know because they did he's not
accompanied by real instruments to play
the beat but still he did manage to
Showcase his lyrical flow you know live
which is awesome
there you go
and of course if you have gotten value
out of this video then do not hesitate
to check out my other reaction videos
