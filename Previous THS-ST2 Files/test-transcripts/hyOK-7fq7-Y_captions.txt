good morning guys welcome to a hectic
day
in the life of making it happen vlog
today
nelly and i have feels like a million
errands to run starting with going to
the post office
it is an adventure for seoul which is
quite an experience in itself
and we have a little bit of a funny
story about post offices
post offices don't seem to be
the most productive forms of
entities in the world not not in the
philippines in the world i mean
post offices in uh miami were quite the
experiences and so they are in austria
too but nelly has
a very funny story she would like to
share about
post offices yeah go ahead we went to
austria
for christmas and i forgot my apartment
keys
and i told my sister can you please send
me the apartment keys i need them
so she sent them and they never arrived
so if you follow me on instagram you
might
remember that i asked a lot of questions
about
post office how to contact people to
know where the
package is so i tried to do my research
i tried to contact the post office
several times
nothing really happened and my package
was basically lost
eight months later i got a message from
my sister saying
oh i got a mess i got a package from
manila and i'm like i haven't sent you
anything i don't know what it is
so she told me it's my keys
that went back to
austria and it's really really weird
because
i even contacted the austin post office
to track uh the order and
never heard of them and then all of a
sudden eight months later
i had my keys back
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
so i just received a package by the way
if you're picking up a package as a
foreigner you have to bring
id and the weird thing is go ahead
i received a package that left germany
on the 23rd of january 2020
and the really weird thing is and the
really weird thing is
i received this product already
it's i don't know i don't quite
understand why i received it a second
time
but i think the first one i got was sent
later then this it's weird i don't know
as i said post offices are always very
uh interesting to say the least
sadly this means this is not the parcel
we were expecting it was uh we were
expecting something for nelly
this is not it
[Music]
i'm just
[Music]
galvanized one four pieces
eight inch by three quarter inch this is
12 foot
one piece template
[Music]
more pipe more pipes
[Music]
oh where's mike michael
okay this is the area that we entered to
get some plain wood
the rice 1.95 yeah one point
yeah i think that's right it's uh it's
120 by 220.
right yeah okay perfect by the way this
guy did a great
great job thumbs up we have a vlog
[Laughter]
so anybody who comes here yes i'll talk
to him
[Laughter]
[Music]
okay thank you
okay with that almost so this is going
to be an additional
this is going to be so cool because this
is going to be kind of like
a shelving plus a work top which is
going to be mobile it's not going to be
it's not going to be mounted to the wall
so we can take it out into the kitchen
and film awesome cooking videos that's
the idea behind that
and hopefully we'll start on sunday yes
finally it's been a while it's been a
while
but we're getting like more stuff for
the kitchen today because we're gonna
get
metro tiles for the wall which are gonna
look really nice hopefully
hopefully we don't know yet hopefully
it'll look really nice and
then that background is going to be so
beautiful for filming videos it's going
to be
bright it's going to be a uniform white
color because now with all the eggshell
and the beige
it was messing up the uh the white
balance on the camera
it's going to be so cool yeah plus
we need those tiles because our
walls are full of oil from cooking so we
need
some kind of protection for the wall in
the background uh because it gets really
really dirty and
it does not look nice so there was a
little bit of a misunderstanding with
the floor tiles they
only gonna arrive here in four days we
will be getting all the
pipes and the wood to build the other
furniture but they'll be here around
they said between four and five so i
have a little bit of time
to talk about sourdough a lot of you
guys have been asking me for my
sourdough recipes and by no means am i
the expert on sourdough i'm just about
starting to learn about it
but here is my sourdough starter which i
fresh freshly fed this morning
and today i'm actually going to try a
new kind of like sourdough recipe
where you just put all the ingredients
into the pot and let it
ferment outside of the fridge at room
temperature
for like 16 hours or more and then
tomorrow i'll knead it and shape it and
prove it and bake it so we'll have
two beautiful loaves of sourdough for
this weekend so
i've been looking up like a whole lot of
different recipes and
what i really don't like is to do my
recipes
in cups i like to use metric measuring
like grams
because a cup is very imprecise you know
if i press
the flour into the cup a little bit
harder then there'll be like
10 more flour in there and i don't
really like that so i have a little
recipe here on my screen
now this calls for 90 grams of starter
but being that my start is a little bit
uh juvenile i'd say
i'm going to take a little bit more i'm
going to increase this to
i'm going to increase this 220 grams
and then i'll reduce the water and the
flour by 15 grams
each so we got the same amount of
hydration as in that recipe
let's see if this works so i'll start
out i have some filtered water which i
let stand for a few hours that it
doesn't uh
the chlorine is is out of it so i got
here
600 grams of water i need minus 15 is
585
so i'll put that in first it's going to
be a very sticky
a very sticky dough which i usually
don't really like sticky doughs
there you go 585 then i said i'll put in
120
of the starter actually i think i should
mix this before i pour it in
and i've learned so much over the past
few weeks about sourdough because
i i mean every time i
use the same recipe it'll it'll have
like a different
outcome even so it's a little bit
confusing at times
but it is a lot of fun
all right so we'll go
120
yeah 120 and i'll have to
refeed the starter then right after this
video
then uh this recipe calls for
16 grams of sea salt
boom and then i'm going to add 15 grams
of honey
to kind of send my sourdough starter
into overdrive so i'll get
a little bit more there you go
i'll get a little bit of a better
fermentation hopefully
this is all just guesswork to me because
i don't really know yet 100
so i'll add the flour and then i'll
start mixing
all right and the recipe i'm trying now
is a little bit
more of a hands-off recipe because the
last recipes that i've been trying
involved a lot of like folding and
kneading and all that stuff
but this recipe is just like combining
all the ingredients
and then letting it ferment at room
temperature by itself
and then just before you
[Music]
just before you bake the next day you do
stretch and falls
and you do you let it proof and that's
it and then in the oven and
you got a beautiful sour loaf hopefully
we'll see well
my spatula just broke so i guess i'll be
mixing this by hand now all right check
it out guys here's my dough
ready to ferment now i just have to
re-feed
my starter which i just put equal
amounts of water and flour in there
and then just stir it let it set and
it'll be ready for
the next sourdough adventure
yep okay
okay well i don't have to unpack it
anymore
okay i didn't get what i was waiting for
at the post office but i got something
that is even more exciting
and more important for me
and it's something that you guys asked
about a lot
a lot lot lot and i'm
so happy that i found someone somebody
in the philippines who
does these and i'm going to show you now
it's so so big
that's what she said
everything in here is handmade
any guesses
[Music]
it takes a while
three two one
wow nelly finally you have your wings to
fly
oh that's a macrame wall art
and i really love that it is it comes
with a
really rustic wood um and
there's so much love for details with
all these nuts and
thingies and tassels and
i will replace it with this one because
this one is too small for this wall
so it's fun because i said yesterday it
would be cool to have a tv here so we
can sit on the couch and watch tv
instantly nelly buys something the next
day to hang in here instead
i know your tactics well
she thinks she's so slime she's tricking
me but i know i know her tricks
i need to put this we've been together
for 13 years i know
all your tricks all my tricks
but yeah very nice very nice yeah i
still need to
fix it properly and everything but um i
will link the artist
in the description down below she
brought me this
in person and she was as as excited as i
was i was like oh my god oh my god oh my
god
wow what a piece of art so
beautiful and ah
it's so pretty and she also also made
this plant hanger so i have this hanging
plant here there's a second
thingy for the plant um yeah nice
okay and before i pick up all the pipes
that fell on the floor
um i'm hungry we've only had like a
little uh
sourdough pancake this morning and i
still had these wagyu
beef burger patties in the fridge so
when we were rusting
i saw these burger buns that look okay i
mean it's not
it's not an artisan burger bun or
something but it's a good average burger
bun and i thought as a snack i'll just
make there's a quick burger
um how many times did i say burger in
one sentence i don't know
but one of the crucial things and one of
the things that i think make my burgers
so good
yes i believe my burgers are very good
um
i wanted to show you what i bought
inside
my burger sauce because that's like the
one of the main things that's like one
of the main stars so
what i always have is crippy mayonnaise
that's like the base of
my burger sauce don't be
skimpy with that be generous then i like
to put in
a little heaping not a lot because this
has a lot of punch to
it it's like a little bit of
dijon mustard then
what i like to put in i haven't put in
in a long time but i always
did like to put it in is a little bit of
worcestershire
the sauce just like one like little
tiniest little splash gives it like
another little kiki kick
and then some heinz ketchup and i'll
just whip up this burger real quick
and show you guys the result oh i
completely forgot two more ingredients
one clove of garlic and then the thing
that makes us like so
much better um two or three drops of
toasted sesame seed oil
i just turbo charges the sauce
[Music]
check foreign the way this heart is
just a sucker for a happy ending
so just as the the burgers were getting
ready
um nelly had to run downstairs real
quick because we got
a craft beer delivery because today uh
right after this after finishing this
vlog
we're gonna film the craft beer video
where we try uh
a ton of different philippine craft
beers super excited for that
uh it's friday today's friday so when
you're watching this we just finished
editing this vlog
and um yeah this week has been like
we've got we
went out for a run every single day this
week and i've done sport at least
twice a day so a run in the morning and
then
weightlifting in the evening and
actually this morning i also started
doing high intensity before
the workout so today it'll be three
workouts so a little bit of burgers and
some beers won't do as much harm
and i also have my little home
gym going on here a little workout bench
courtesy
of facebook marketplace and some
uh dumbbells and this right now is kind
of my
favorite time of the day because it's
just as the sun is about to set so
it's a few minutes before golden hour
and the light rays just come into the
apartment and light this place up with
this beautiful
warm soft light probably the shot is
overexposed right now but it's just
so so nice oh nelly's here maybe the
burgers are ready to be devoured
the what the burgers are ready to be
eaten yes
yeah that shot totally was of exposed
but you know that doesn't matter i just
wanted to demonstrate how
nice and bright and lit up the places
right now
so here we go this is a wagyu burger
these beef patties were really
inexpensive
uh we got them at ruston's marketplace
and they were
i think it was 12 per package
so it was 12 burger patties for 700
pesos
so we've been yeah we've had these like
for over a week
and they're frozen so you just defrost
them and then okay
looks juicy oh my god
this might be crack no
really it's really good
but the supermarket the burger buns are
great really
it's nice that's pretty good right
mm-hmm
super super excited about this bubble
don't
oh that smells good it's like the bread
farted in my face
[Music]
okay when mike said that it's going to
be a busy day ahead
he did not mention that we filmed two
videos that we will film two videos and
edit two videos
um and right now we're preparing for a
very special video
here these are craft beers from
the philippines we joe's brew
i'm so excited for this uh so we're
going to film that
and
what we're not gonna film is nelly uh
once said hey let's have some curry this
evening
and we're having curry and nut and nelly
wanted me to make fresh
naan so that's what i'm doing right here
that's not the sourdough this is another
thing so
so see i spent my whole day just cooking
for me
um i'm going to cool these beers now we
are going to have them later for the
video
and um yeah the post office experience
was interesting as always uh the people
