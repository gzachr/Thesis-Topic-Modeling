game news i am your host ovila
albus and today we will be reacting to
the ambassador
manny pacquiao yes and more specifically
opponents before and after
fighting manny pacquiao yes this video
has over 14 million
views so it must be something right
but before we start please consider
follow me on instagram at music
game news and without further ado let's
jump right into it
in boxing looks can be deceiving
the misconception of those fighters who
have more bite than bark
and those who look much less dangerous
at the weigh-in
than when that first punch hits home
[Music]
are they saying that pacquiao doesn't
look threatened ruiz jr
golovkin and many more very few
fit this persona quite like the man who
can be considered today's most
successful active fighter
manny pac-man pacquiao
[Music]
a relatively small kind and humble
filipino
fighter whose fight night performances
bring much more than meets the eye
here contrasting the humble and the
arrogant we look at some of pacquiao's
opponents from the past
around the time that he was arguably at
both his physical
and commercial prime my god rightly so
believed that they could beat the
eight-weight world champion
to be honest with you guys i never watch
uh fighting sports you know ufc
or boxing or anything like that because
i just think
these sports are just too violent you
know and i don't understand the concept
of cheering uh two people who
are beating the crap out of each other
you know basically
harming each other i don't condone this
and that's why i don't watch it
my brother on the other hand watches it
okay
but obviously i've heard of the best you
know even if you don't watch a sport
you still know who the best is and
that's why you know people want to be
number one
because the entire world will hear about
you
even if they're not interested
personally in uh what you do you know
what i mean
i think he has all the tools it takes to
beat a guy like manny pacquiao there's
ever a time for
hatton to be able to beat pacquiao he'll
be in this fight in the same
performances
that lead to manny becoming one of
boxing's most respected figures
of all time please click thumbs up
subscribe and press the bell button if
you're new to the channel
as we i really like his smile look at
before and after fighting manny pacquiao
presentation i don't know
if i'm gonna enjoy this video man
but we'll see we'll see who knows before
and after fighting manny pacquiao okay
let's see let's check it out
first up we go back 11 years to a night
billed as
the dream match pacquiao versus de la
hoya
i just have to make sure pacquiao when
he when he comes in with his uh
explosive style um and his heart punches
i have to make sure i have my hands up
even then maybe was considered the
world's number one pound for pound
wow look at him looking so young
i'm enjoying the music though and i've
heard of the name de la hoya before
even then manny was considered the
world's number one pound-for-pound
fighter
however many pundits how tall is manny
pacquiao because he does not look tall
at all speculated that the size and
reach difference
wow there you go my my
my questions have been answered so at
the time he was 29 years old
he is one meter and 68 centimeters
what the dude is pretty short he's
definitely short
um and he's 64 kilograms
prince was simply too great my
motivation
has been his skills my motivation has
been his youth
and whilst there was little if any trash
talk
oscar told news stations that he and his
team
were unbeatable protect yourself let's
go
instead after being made the betting
underdog
manny exposed oscar's age on the night
in one of the best displays of his
career what i saw was a beat down i saw
oscar de la hoya because
hey ah what's his name this host
i like this host he um you know he he
talks about basketball a lot so i watch
his interviews and stuff about the nba
tremendously damages his legacy i just
couldn't pull the trigger
i was gun shy were you hurt in that
fight
never just emotionally has a lot of
energy that was very difficult we didn't
know him to be what he was and what he
became after that
were you shocked and that i mean we were
shocked but were you shocked too
i was shocked for about two years
next six months later a showdown with
britain's beloved brawler
ricky hatton never had 15 months after
the hitman's loss to mayweather
he'd agreed to jump straight back in at
the deep end
and labeling pacquiao as one-dimensional
he launched a more verbal approach
during the build-up
same move every time right hook roll
under
right hook rolling right up
just give him something to spin off onto
him
is ever a time for hatton to be able to
beat this guy looks like our kelly
one that come fight night didn't bode
too well
over in brutal fashion with a
picture-perfect punch
[Applause]
[Music]
ultimately led to hatton's retirement
big win
would have punished like that so early
on and that you know
a lot of if somebody's got me that's
boxing one punch that's what it is he
ended his career yeah another six months
on
and yet another hall of fame fighter
stepped forward
miguel cotto a puerto rican one lost to
his name
at the time 150 percent sure
i'm going to build money i'm the
strongest
boxing of boss i'm pretty smart
in a build-up void of arrogance or
brashness he looks scared
he did however expect to be able to
overpower pacquiao
just like the rest
[Applause]
ironically carrying his power into the
late browns
pacquiao managed a stoppage in the 12th
making him the first
seven weight world champion in history
i love it pacquiao doesn't say your
thing you know humble and just
beats their ass
he speaks with his actions you know what
i mean
pac-man let's go
oh my god he ruined his
all face
early 2010 and this time it was the turn
of josh claudi
a ghanaian fighter who funnily enough
also returned to the ring earlier this
year
now aged 41. i might be that 41.
opportunity because if men pakistan is
not going to fight you sure
it's not going to happen so their
friendship dies
when you get to the ring after the fight
the friendship come back i know
what what i'm going to face and i know
who i'm going to face
it's not going to be an easy fight for
all of us another matchup which lacked
any animosity respectful fighters
than the moments right before the
opening bell of a manny pacquiao fight
on the night however pacquiao pulled off
a shutout performance
not losing a step boom
what an amazing combination puncture
this man is i respect him
and he's the best fighter everybody
affords
i don't think i lost i lost too many
pacquiao
he's very very fast contrastingly
at the back end of the year pacquiao
don't you guys think that that fighter
looks a little bit like
akon second attempt at negotiations with
mayweather had broken down
cue the arrival humble and popular
opponent
the infamous antonio margarito margarito
margarita
we're going to have to be on frederick's
scale right now before i wrote that
that's a nice thing somewhat of a
bittersweet victory
for the smaller and more humble man
might be able to pull off
oh my god look at that and you ruined
his face
right here in this fourth round manny
mauled the mexican fighter over
12 rounds and there truly couldn't have
been a more fitting
occasion for pacquiao now the octuple
champion
to reach bach did you see margarito's
face it was it looked like a freaking
uh tomato bleeding tomato
boxing's greatest accolades
we knew man he was very fast and we were
going good until i got cut
and then that's when the problem started
coming next
11 months after manny's knockout loss to
marquez in late 2012
he returned to face basically
don't you dare you know uh
insult pacquiao before the fight if you
do
that's what he what that's what he's
gonna do to you okay just be fair with
pacquiao
and you know he may have mercy on you
oh brandon rios also trained under
robert garcia in california you know
what
to me i think he's scared and afraid
roach is scared i wouldn't be surprised
if he tried to cancel the fight saying
that i hurt my hand or something just
because he's scared
after the first clash of camps in the
margarito fight
it meant that the beef this time around
was more about the trainers
than the fighters themselves
yet in the same clinical fashion
pacquiao proved too fast and too
active putting a second l on rios's
resume
oh oh wow punching bag
filipino i like i worked my ass out so
hard five months the gym
another year on and another unbeaten
fighter
this time the smart fast new york native
chris algieri
after i beat manny i'll have a lot more
coal a lot more
juice to be able to oh come on he has a
handsome face is he gonna ruin his face
as well
but by knocking manny pacquiao in china
right next to his hometown
i mean that's uh it's hard to say what
would happen after that but that would
uh either way my career is gonna be
catapulted into into another
stratosphere after this fight so humble
and respectful
he entered the fight with nothing but
praise for pacquiao
said if he doesn't want to punch i will
create an action if he does punch
[Music]
[Applause]
that he's continued to preach
exponentially
ongoing career he's a savvy veteran with
65 fights
and he knows exactly how his style works
even to today six years on where he
expects him to overwhelm keith thurman
in a couple of weeks time less than
three years ago
jesse vargas also came in thinking he
had the tools to beat a
now aging version of manny
[Music]
expecting to overwhelm pacquiao to
avenge the losses of pereira and morales
putting himself as top ranks hottest
asset now it's my time you know i
planned this as a kid i said i wanted to
take him out
and now i get the opportunity to do so
and i will
legend man their top dog
their top guy you know i mean they're
gonna push me from then on following the
pattern
vargas believed his speed in size would
be too much oh hell no so just like the
rest
pacquiao dropped him in the second
to win comfortably across all three
scorecards
[Applause]
you know it's not just about the size or
the strength
or the speed you know what i mean it's
about the heart
and just the mental
the the spirit you know what i mean it's
about
how pure you are
trying my sheesh you know i promise to
come back stronger i tried looking for
the victory i tried
connecting with the big shots i mean you
i threw more punches than manny so i was
looking for the win
and whilst most believe that yet another
unfair decision loss was the end of the
road for manny
[Applause]
[Music]
it instead sparked the desire for one
last rise to the top
and that rise started with arguably the
biggest contrast of the lie
i think i'm about to lose the manny
pacquiao man
the habitually loud and outspoken trash
talker from cincinnati
adrian
[Music]
despite being damn looks like uh
pacquiao lost a lot of ways here
unable to put him away pacquiao stalked
the american
right to the final bell
[Applause]
though just like horn broner believed he
had won by making manny miss and hitting
him clean
i beat him everybody out there i know i
beat him
everybody out there it seemed as though
you couldn't get it's close enough
it already sounded like it was against
me so i already ain't gonna hide against
you already
the noise from the crowd however spoke
volumes as onlookers
saw a very different fight i think the
whole hood who came out here i love
y'all
i did this for the hood y'all know i
beat that boy whilst the majority now
stand in awe
of pacquiao's ability to fight so
competitively into his later year
what is that his wife is she filipina
she she looks maybe a half or mixed
filipina i don't know
none are more understanding of just how
capable
those who witnessed his scintillating
best
and at a time when every fight is make
or break
manny now prepares for another brash
confidence
check out that beautiful flag not just
beat manny pacquiao
does knock out manny pacquiao hoping to
put another
incredible tally on a truly remarkable
career
is that it
greek mythology stories from the
dawn of western civilization all right
okay i did not this is not what i
expected
from this video i honestly thought we
were just gonna see
uh the state of multiple fighters that
pacquiao
fought and what they looked like after
the fight you know to see exactly
how badly he you know he won
and the state in which they were at you
know
i guess we saw a little bit of that but
this was more like a documentary style
of video you know and i agree the guy
who narrated the video has a beautiful
deep
voice you know and he could definitely
narrate any documentary out there you
know
uh but yeah i liked it because i learned
a few
things about manny pacquiao and i've
noticed something
is that from fight to fight the
uh his body shape would change
you know he would bulk up and sometimes
he would like shrink
because i believe in boxing there are
different um like levels
or weights right like heavyweights and
underweights i don't know i don't know
what they're called but yeah you
basically
have to become bigger to be part of the
heavyweights and
become smaller to be part of the other
class or whatever i don't know i'm not
sure i don't know much about
uh boxing so let me know in the comment
section below
but definitely the dude is a legend and
like i said from
what i can gather from the multiple
videos that i reacted to of many
pacquiao
it's not really about just you know the
physical aspect
it's mental you know mental and it's
about the soul
and heart you know if you really want it
you can go and get it
and i think i think like a lot of
filipino
celebrities and artists and
athletes it's not just about them you
know they're great
because they have an entire country
behind them
you know that supports them and that
really really believes in them
and is just unbelievable i mean i can
tell i mean i'm not even filipino yeah
you tell me that i'm filipino by heart
i'm not even filipino and yet i can feel
the the love and the support from
all of you guys so i can't even
imagine to be a native filipino
who you know is successful and trying to
become
number one in his field or her field and
having all that love and support from an
entire country
you know the filipino country it must be
insane i mean
you just cannot like lose or fail when
you have
all that love you know and that's why
there are so many successful filipinos
out there
yeah man it's because of them obviously
first but also because
of their uh of their country yeah man
yeah man they're very proud very very
proud
um there you go guys so let me know in
the comment section below your thoughts
