I love this massage
so boys one
it's boarding like
sun's rising and I did not sleep at home
so guys we need to do the mobile hi
squad Christmas giveaway question so
that question is when is the last time
you pulled an all-nighter
describe the last time you pulled an
all-nighter just like I did
chance to win 100,000
RJ's getting his beauty rest wow this
one is rising pretty fast
getting great in here
that means they're going to serve
breakfast ooh
now another thing I love about Delta
that I just discovered was that you
could have full internet for the entire
flight for only like $21 charged to my
credit card it's amazing and like good
internet see I'm stream I'm watching
YouTube videos it's incredible and the
reason why this is a big deal for me is
because for pal for Philippine Airlines
first of all to get internet for the
entire flight you have to pay over fifty
dollars charged to your credit card and
then their internet is very spotty like
sometimes you can go half the flight
with no internet and pal had this like
note saying that you know having
internet on flight requires some
advanced technology and all of this and
I understand that and I accepted that
I'm like oh okay so this is normal so no
plane has good good enough internet
really and then I was some flying this
Delta flight I'm so surprised I can pull
out watch youtube videos so I'm just
really impressed okay
I am super presto Delta amazing amazing
business class
food is amazing everything just amazing
wild ice look at breakfast hmm amazing
look at that purple purple rice hmm hey
chicken Wow
I see chicken cucumber amazing mushrooms
Wow some food more of this awesome
pepper paste love it and there's even a
Lindor chocolate oh nice
to your chicken
[Music]

RJ you slipped the law but it was a nice
plate yeah okay RJ honestly compare the
three Airlines Pal business class Korean
air business class and Delta business
class which do you like the best
pollen Delta Palin Delta okay sure and
then which is better Delta or pal when
it comes to the seeds I like what can
