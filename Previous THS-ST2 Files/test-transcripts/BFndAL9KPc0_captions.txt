ah
yo almost
for today I have decided to react to yet
another video that will present us with
some Filipinos who made pinoy's proud
yes sir I wonder if it will only feature
uh singers or just a batch of Filipinos
whether it be in sports maybe in beauty
pageants maybe you know
table pool players cause you guys have a
legend there right so we will see but
before we start make sure to follow me
on Instagram at music game news because
that is where you can DM me your
suggestions and of course consider
subscribing to this Channel and liking
the video because it definitely helps
with the YouTube algorithm all right
without further Ado let's jump right
into it
thank you
what is it about Filipino talents that
make them Stand Out here's the thing
Philippines in particular
David Foster and boyabunda two legends
all right in their domain their own
domain right David Foster of uh Canadian
Legend you know as a composer pianist
and all that boyabunda Filipino Legend
as an interview interviewer and
journalist
nice we've seen it with Korea with K-pop
and I guarantee you in the next five
years there's going to be some
Superstars come from Asia and that's
what's going to happen
true
it means a lot Filipinos are known for
their talent they are also known to be
one of the most competitive people in
the world
to knowing myself I grew up watching
different amateur beauty pageants Sports
dancing competitions let me tell you
that those things you go that's cool
because of that competitors push
themselves really hard sometimes hard
enough that they reach not just the
national level of talent but also stand
out as one of the best in the world
yo like two months ago I think I reacted
for the first time uh to Filipino
basketball man it was like the best
dunks of the year or something like that
I was extremely impressed by the talent
and the level of basketball of Filipino
basketball
uh also I think that this year the um
basketball World Cup will take place in
the Philippines man that is awesome
[Applause]
wow I got chills I got chills when I saw
all these fantastic Filipino artists
that I have reacted to you know already

what in the world are you going to be
showing us in this video for you to feel
obligated to put such a disclaimer this
is
um a little I don't know uh
it's stressful
sb19 fits those criteria I can easily
say that all of them are talented but
you can't deny that some of them have
god-given talents like Styles vocals
[Music]
I remember
hey I think I've reacted to a
performance of a SBA 19 with Regine
Velazquez
and Ken's unique low voice
yeah a lot of sb19 members are doing
their own thing now but they also have
extremely skilled members and Justin
Josh and Pablo who equally contributes
through the creative side of things
exceptional dancing an inventive
songwriting
skills that they didn't acquire on the
get-go but through rigorous years of
training they practice dance routines 1
000 times before they even performed
them in public
performing for nobody since no one knew
them back then yeah they even got
criticized in their own home country why
[Music]
okay
but that didn't stop them from becoming
the now Philippine cultural ambassadors
they started Making Waves by becoming
the first Pinoy pop group that broke a
record in the Billboard charts
I did record that seventh week at number
one yeah the Filipino group single
surpasses the six week run of bts's
butter they were also The First Filipino
artists to have performed on a major
ustv Network and proceeded to have the
Nationwide concert tour in that country
at this point there's no denying the
fact that sb19 has already established
their place in the Pinoy music industry
by not just expanding its reach but also
boosting Philippines tourism it's I
believe that as be I mean we can say
that sb19 is the most popular
um p-pop group right like it's the most
popular pop group in the Philippines
quite evident by looking at these
amazing people that came from different
parts of the world and decided to visit
the Philippines because of them
now that's something to be proud of
another Filipino or rather Filipina that
we need to be proud of is SB 19's friend
herself AC Bonifacio together with her
wait how does this person know that
those uh YouTubers or vloggers or
whatever visited the Philippines for
sb19 like that's there that was their
main purpose you know like that was the
reason for them to visit the Philippines
or like the primary reason you know
brother lucky they formed a duo called
lucky Aces and they made it to the
Yellen show to Showcase their
electrifying dance moves
they're so cute
they're so cute
[Applause]
people were blown away by how good they
were despite being at a very young age
this gave them the opportunity to meet
and perform with the one and only Ariana
Grande
if you want to
um the TNT boys also met Ariana Grande
and I believe it was also on the Ellen
show I think
join me for Love Me Harder yeah and then
you guys can just do it
[Music]
that's so cool that's really cool
popular dance movie franchise called
Step Up
[Music]
in 2021 AC represented the Philippines
in the yearly YouTube Fan Fest together
with sb19 and also have done multiple
collaborations for them
what I really like about these types of
performers are their songs visuals and
dance breaks but did you know that
another Pinoy artist had already been
utilizing dance breaks in the early
2000s oh yeah exactly
yep yep yep
thank you
he actually represented the Philippines
in France like last year I think and he
actually won the show what was the show
called again Dancing with the Stars
right I think was dancing with the stars
yeah
enter Billy Crawford
oh man in my opinion this dude has got
to be one of the most underrated
Filipino artists absolutely barely does
anything let me tell you why he is
underrated it's because he was popular
outside of the Philippines but not
everywhere it was really popular in
Europe and especially in France and
that's why he went back to France to uh
be part of Dancing With the Stars where
he actually won the show you know and
I've even watched uh an interview of
Billy Crawford in French you know his
French is all right it's actually all
right
but I mean Filipinos knew of him you
know when he started dancing and singing
and he was even like a backup dancer for
Michael Jackson at some point right
give them the credit he deserves anymore
most people only see him as some goofy
guy with a few dance moves but little
did they know that one of his greatest
achievements was being able yeah
[Music]
Michael Jackson
oh the girl is dangerous
[Applause]
the girl is dangerous
just so you know MJ my favorite artist
of all time
oh gosh see
[Applause]
I did not know that he was part of this
video so thank you to the uh person
that's making this uh this video for uh
teaching me this who who's actually
making the video
casual casual Chuck why is it casual
Chuck wasn't it casual Chuck is it like
a
a word uh play on on the word casual
casual Chuck okay
cool cool
it's so unreal thinking that they
actually practice together and even had
some cool interactions
no that was MJ excuse
foreign
um hi my name is Michael tell you that
there are better games on that side
oh my gosh
[Music]
to pursue a career in Show Business he
started releasing songs
[Music]
and even landed an interesting role in
Hollywood and one of those Exorcist
movies what
don't ever touch me with that again
preach and did you know that Billy
actually has no idea Pokemon theme song
in its first movie you know having the
pleasure of singing the theme song for
the movie was great I mean first 10
minutes of the movie
oh my God that brings me back
[Music]
this man is definitely full of
achievements and I'm not even done yet
the early 2000s was when he hit his
Prime with these songs
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
I actually reacted to a couple of his
most popular music videos when M Angel
was still part of the of the channel
you wanna get with me
[Music]
yeah this is one of his most popular
songs
[Music]
his music broke into the charts all over
Europe and he even reached number one in
the Netherlands there you go that's what
I said Crawford became big he was like
of Europe and France just look at this
crowd
give me
[Music]
[Music]
bonjour there you go
I just became the champion of the latest
season of dance with the stars in France
personally I think he's a better dancer
than he is a singer but I still think
he's a great singer I just prefer his
dancing to his singing wow he is uh
dancing to a um Belgium
um singer called Stromae honestly if
you've never heard of this artist do
yourself a favor and go listen to his
music
this guy is an artist with a big a okay
he's he's excellent
[Music]
[Music]
oh I gotta watch this
see I've I have not seen this uh dance
performance I gotta check it out because
he's dancing to my favorite songs
obviously did this man hey with tyke
perhaps it makes sense why he achieved
all the success because the man is hard
working in fact he has been working hard
since he was four years old in a popular
Filipino variety show called that's
Entertainment and at that time he worked
with one of the best Filipino artists
ever
Leia Salonga
just like Billy Leia started working for
a very young age for 10 years old she
was already able to release her solo
album
Lea Salonga is a Filipina singer that I
would potentially put at the same level
as Regine Velazquez you know and I know
that a lot of people actually consider
her better than regime like for them she
is the queen you know the queen Diva of
the Philippines
at age 17 she auditioned for Miss Saigon
to get the lead role of Kim
[Music]
yeah I think I reacted to this video as
well
[Music]
sharing the sky
we have been
[Music]
the Gated look of these producers
obviously tells that they have already
found one they got it yeah yeah hit the
high notes but also perfectly executed
the low notes
she then secured the roll and went on to
make history by becoming the first ever
Asian actress to win a Tony Award and
the Tony award goes to
Leia Salonga
she also played the role of eponine and
Fantine in the musical Les Miserables on
Broadway just take a look at this
exclusive Club anyone would kill to get
included in there now that's something
to be proud of
and not only that but Leia also became
the singing voice of not just one
but two
[Music]
but two Disney Princesses
[Music]
rare so the Walt Disney Company honored
her to become one of the few Disney
Legends
she went through discrimination in the
past oh they're not gonna see you
they're not going to see you because
you're unfortunately I'm sure that there
are people out there who are just
waiting for me to mess up but that
didn't stop her from achieving her
dreams to this day lay us among his
legacy has already been immortalized as
she became an inspiration for aspiring
performers for generations to come I
know that you wanted more people to be
and I promise you I will ah okay well to
be fair the title of this video is
Filipinos who made the noise proud
number one so I'm guessing he's gonna
make more and shout out to you for
making such a great video honestly it's
pretty good but I think I would have
made a video with um you know Filipinos
with legendary Filipinos that made
pinoy's proud because here it's a mix of
like brand new Filipinos that are
successful like right now
with you know Filipinos that made Pinoy
Sprout years ago you know what I'm
saying videos for now let me just say
that our flag doesn't fly because the
wind moves it
moves it it flies because of the
Filipinos who are proud to wave it
so this was great obviously I was
familiar with Billy Crawford Lea Salonga
and sb19 but at least he introduced me
to the kids that were on the Ellen show
I am actually surprised that my
community never told me about them and
never asked me to react to them
um but yeah man sb19 they are the latest
Filipino big thing you know that
Filipinos are extremely hyped about that
they're getting a lot of you know
International recognition and rightfully
so you know they are very very hard
working uh hard-working band you know
and I love the fact that they are also
individually doing their own thing but
they never forget that they are part of
a group you know they're still working
on sb19
um Lea Salonga Billy Crawford they don't
actually have to prove anything anymore
but yeah it would be great if he could
mention other oh he already made the
second video Filipinos who made the
noise proud number two oh oh oh okay and
the thumbnail I can see some I think
it's more about acting and sports here
okay so if you guys enjoyed this
reaction video maybe I will react to his
number two video and of course I mean he
should also mention Charisse because
sharizu you know she made Filipinos
proud internationally man anyways
and of course if you have found value in
this video do not hesitate to check out
my other reaction videos right here
