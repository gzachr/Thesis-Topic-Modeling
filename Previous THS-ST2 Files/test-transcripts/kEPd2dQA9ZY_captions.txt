the largest tropical
storm since 2016 is on its way to the
philippines right now
very nice day today yes sunny day yeah
last day big storm coming
my god we are back to crazy panic by
oh
oh
good morning guys and welcome to a sunny
sunny beautiful day in makati today
is a very very crucial day because today
we have to make preparations for the
upcoming
tropical storm
ah
i'm never really oh this is dirty oh my
god it's so dirty i'm never really sure
if i'm supposed to be paying for parking
here
or not the largest
tropical storm since 2016
is on its way to the philippines right
now if the past has been
in any sense a good experience or a good
way to prepare for this then
lily and i both know that if the storm
comes
all shops grocery stores etc could be
closed
from tomorrow for who knows how long now
if you guys
are new around here you won't know but
nelly and i used to live in miami beach
and we've gone through a few category
five
hurricanes in the past so we know more
or less how to prepare so what we need
is non-perishable foods fresh veggies
some meat
and of course some water now water we
got bottles at home that we can fill up
but everything else
we need to do right now i'm going to do
a quick grocery run and see what i can
get here
at russians now now it totally would
make more sense to
go and get these groceries by car but if
you saw yesterday's vlog we took
the cars for a nice ride yesterday and
today
i just want to take the motorbike out
for one last time
before the rain starts
so when i first heard of the storm
coming i thought to myself
100 oh my god we are back to crazy
panic by but i will say not at all
the shop was really really empty uh not
a lot of people and there's
there's very little traffic
make it another day
i mean look guys there's very very
little traffic it's super calm
well i guess it is a saturday but i
really did expect more people to be here
oh such a beautiful day you can barely
believe
that there's a huge storm coming
[Music]
all right i just quickly dropped off the
first groceries
at the lobby of our building and i'm
gonna
take a ride out to buy some few small
things
and also of course maybe grab coffee
somewhere
i always feel like uh even though i have
great coffee at home
i really really love to go buy coffee
shops and
grab a grab a coffee there i don't know
there's just something about
being amongst people hello
excuse me people use your indicator
use your indicator
yeah i just love i love being with
people
enjoying my coffee and that's been
something really hard during this whole
like social distancing thing not being
able to socialize whatsoever
anyway it has been so much fun just
taking the bike out for
short rides just enjoying the sun
and enjoying doss
so nice all right guys
great news boyfriend beauty is completed
i got all the groceries i've done
all the panic buying for this weekend
now i get to ride the bike and enjoy it
i'm gonna drive over to btc
and grab some coffee it is going to be
nice it is a very nice day to ride the
bike hello
how's it going
so i'm going to take the overpass drive
over to bgc
um maybe stop by arabic or for some
coffee
very nice day today yes yeah
last day big storm coming
bye
i love riding the motorcycle when you
just stop at the light you have a quick
chat to whoever's standing next to you
oh
oh man the buses here in the philippines
scare me i hate
riding my bike around buzzers
this looks a little bit uh a little bit
tight i'll
wait this one off seeing this beautiful
sunset up there it is really hard to
believe
that we are about to have the
strongest tropical storm hitting us
since 2016 the strongest storm
on planet earth in 2020.
that's scary nelly we got to prep
we need to we need to fill up all our
water bottles
so we have our own water filtration
system
right here this little tab gives us
drinking water
nicely filtered drinking water and
underneath here there is a
i think it's a one gallon or two gallon
a water tank a water reserve
but i want to fill up all our water
bottles because
this needs electricity and
during a storm it can happen that the
power goes out
and the water gets shut off that we know
that from miami that is something
that is a tough reality that could
happen so we're going to fill up all our
bottles we've got a ton of food here
so we're safe when it comes to food we
can easily go by for like five days
without having to go shopping and uh
yeah just water is like super super
super critical
these uh words get coconut water from a
store
and we keep these plastic bottles
because they're super practical for
storing water
so we've got one two three four five six
liters of water
and this is just like i mean you're
supposed to drink like at least three
liters of water per day
but if it's tight you can live off one
bottle of water a day one liter not
healthy but i mean it's better than
nothing
and so in case water or power goes off
we have water for three days
[Music]
you
