foreign
[Laughter]
number one and it was a very good video
very interesting very educational except
that the artists that were featured I
was already familiar with and as a
matter of fact as I was getting closer
to the end to that video during my
reaction I was wondering if there was
already a part two or a second video or
a second installment and as a matter of
fact there was already a second
installment obviously called Filipinos
who made the noise proud number two and
just by looking at the thumbnail it
looked more appealing and interesting to
me because I could barely recognize
the period the pinoys that were featured
on the thumbnails so I think this second
video is going to be more educational
for me and perhaps for you as well so
get comfortable because this second
video is a little bit longer than the
first one we're gonna try not to pause
too much you know but I always fail at
that attempt because I have a lot of
things to share with you guys all the
time before we start of course consider
subscribing to the channel and liking
the video because it is important
unfortunately uh for the channel right
and of course make sure to follow me on
Instagram at music game news because
that is where you can be a me your
suggestions and without further Ado
let's jump right into it
I'm gonna bend you over and saw Papi and
no one will stop me you understand me
I'm the underdog bro you don't even know
what you stepped into bro you don't even
know
that's very vulgar
first of all I'd like to thank um God my
team my brothers and my dad for training
me salt puppy so I'm guessing he is a uh
fighter right a UFC Fighter Ultimate
Fighting Champion fighter
uh that's what I'm understanding
um or just a boxer
boxing giving me this opportunity okay
I'm very happy to be here
and for um I'd like to thank Andy warsky
as well for taking this fight respect
and respect for it wow did you see the
approach the Filipino approach that is
so humble and respectful man in contrast
to uh Andy warsky's approach with that
was just so confronting confrontational
and
um
you know vulgar
and um he can talk as much as he wants
um but I let my hands do the talking
yeah yeah
well said your final word it's the
actions that talk louder
knocked him out
salt Poppy I love his name social media
has been taking over the entertainment
industry it's also starting to make
noise in the professional sports
industry
[Music]
all right so at a first glance I read
the disclaimer in my reaction to the
first video if you're interested
the anime and playing video games this
chubby Filipino dude is a living proof
that muscles alone don't win fights but
real talent as skill oh yeah
[Music]
for better opportunities in life he
loved boxing ever since he was a kid
because of Manny Pacquiao he used to
engage in street fights for fun in some
of his Vlog my gosh Manny Pacquiao a
legend he has inspired so many Filipinos
but I'm thinking they're just Filipinos
you know so many kids that want to
become like him and succeed like him
that's awesome which are actually
entertaining to watch but he never
really trained seriously
ish
he worked as a nurse in the Mental
Health institution for five years not
surprising his fake run Challenge and
Tick-Tock went viral
[Music]
his popularity is skyrocketed and it
didn't stop there because it became even
more popular when he started uploading
videos of himself pouring salt in the
most ridiculous ways he could ever
imagine
[Laughter]
this is so ridiculous
nice this is when he earned his Infamous
nickname he made my God man social media
Tick Tock specifically is can be so dumb
at times I mean when you know I'm I am
sent Tick Tock videos like this one I
just can't help but shake my head you
know oh my gosh
when he was given the opportunity to
match up against the English YouTuber
Halal him days before the fight salt
Poppy's opponent couldn't stop talking
smack you think you're better than
boxing than me bastard shut up I'm going
to send your Filipino back to China
bastard shut up but come fight night he
made Halal regret everything he said
the
internet took notice because it was
three full rounds of humiliation
[Applause]
and he's delivered yeah I like this guy
but at this point Seoul poppy was only
seen as some Chuck you know I am you I
mean I know that that in boxing there
are different weight levels right but
the boxers the popular boxes that I'm
used to seeing are like you know Manny
Pacquiao and um
what's his name The Undefeated Champion
the American guy and they all look you
know super fit or Muhammad Ali or Mike
Tyson right they're usually very fit so
it's it's pretty different for me to see
guys that you know uh exercise boxing
but that aren't necessarily necessarily
that fit
so he got matched up against a twitch
streamer who was more fit and more
arrogant than the first one
I'm not coming in here to like have fun
I'm coming like in here to murder you
bro and that's something to do bro
are you is there an element of surprise
that you're worried about with Andy
right we haven't seen a lot from him
for this fight I feel more condition I'm
gonna take him on the first round oh
really first round confidence all right
salt poppy in the black how about salt
Poppy the South Pole oh boy
sold puppy on some of the best songs
so he did it did he take him out in the
first round
hey he did the dance
the video
[Music]
[Applause]
wow
puppy this mod was talking about a fight
with KSI earlier in the week
[Applause]
stay true to his word the internet then
blew up
violated every ounce of Andy warsky's
ego the matchmakers then wanted to see
how salt poppy reacts when he gets
tested like really tested so they
matched him up against an American MMA
fighter Josh Bruckner on paper it was
looking like our guy didn't have a
chance because not only does this guy
have a total of eight professional
fights but he was also bigger at six
foot one and stronger judging by his
muscle so this guy is a UFC fighter
right take a look at the difference
and he's much taller
[Applause]
damn he's got a punch man
[Applause]
oh yeah oh yeah I'm enjoying this video
a lot more I am learning so much I mean
I did not know that this guy even
existed before this video so thank you
to casual casual Chuck yes I remember
that name casual Chuck because it's very
close to Casual you know
um this is awesome the next you know
Manny Pacquiao who knows right but then
again you don't want to be compared to
money you want to be your own self so
salt puppy let's go the name is so cool
left hand step inside the guard you
don't see that a lot and taking
advantage of the inside Lane and popping
in this was the fight consult poppy
gained the respect of everybody even the
pros who are the top three Creator
boxers right now it's all poppy yes one
one yes
technically wise and like he seems like
he understands boxing at a higher level
so I would say salt popping technically
also well-deserved so entertaining so
good so sexy he just seems like he gets
everything and he's understanding it and
I think he's gonna get better this win
kind of pulled him into the top five
pounds per pound influencer boxing
fights with big names such as KSI and
Jake Paul heck some of them are even
scared of him now now well I'm just
trying this uh against all products
twice now so no more South Poles yeah
people want me to fight so poppy it's
not happening okay I need to fight Jay
pull I can't get distracted now no man
the Loki feels good when people fear us
another Filipino who should be feared is
De Bautista uh yeah I'm familiar with a
Bautista
as a matter of fact Guardians of the
Galaxy vol 3 is coming out so let me
know if you're excited
to see Dave Bautista in uh in his role
in that movie again and probably the
last time you'll see him in the Marvel
Universe I'm very excited because I
really enjoyed the uh the two previous
movies so I'm pumped
foreign
he was born and raised in Washington DC
by his American mom and Filipino dad who
worked as a taxi driver and a barber
they lived interested in poverty see
that's super interesting because most of
the mixed Filipinos that I talked to uh
uh it's the mother who's usually
Filipina but here it's it's the opposite
their home was located in a place where
crime was a daily routine he once said
in an interview that he had witnessed a
total of three murders right in front of
their house as a kid
it didn't take too long for him to adopt
a similar lifestyle because as early as
13 he was already stealing cars by age
17 he started Living independently
working as a nightclub bouncer wow that
job didn't last long as he was arrested
after a fight against two customers one
of them was rendered unconscious he then
got sentenced to one year probation
he then worked as a lifeguard after that
and at this time he already had two kids
broke down in shame and he had to borrow
money from his co-worker just to give
his kids some Christmas gifts his
struggles continued until he found
bodybuilding and started going all in
into wrestling which led him to develop
a monstrous physique and this didn't
happen until he was in his early 30s
this was him before
this was him after hitting the gym damn
dude is almost unrecognizable yep but
despite his hard work a lot of people
still doubted him he tried out in WCW
but immediately got rejected and was
told by one of their pro wrestlers that
he would never make it in the proceed
when one door closes another opens
because this led him to get accepted to
debut in a much bigger organization the
WWE from this point on his career would
snowball as he carried the iconic stage
name Batista he racked up multiple tag
team and World title belts and was able
to share the ring with legendary
wrestlers like Triple H John Cena Rey
Mysterio and the Undertaker to name you
no not the rock this line of profession
is very dangerous
[Music]
so injuries weren't a stranger to him so
he decided to put it on hold and started
venturing into acting as expected a lot
of people doubted him again but not for
long yeah there you go the Marvel
Cinematic Universe where is Gamora yeah
oh do you want better he's hilarious
come on
multiple highly rated movies such as
Blade Runner 2049 June end game knockout
the cabin yeah what I like about this
dude is he never forgot about his
Heritage he's a loud and proud Filipino
he is so proud that he got the total of
three tattoos representing his Filipino
Roots it was always she really just
taught to be proud of my Heritage my
mom's reading my dad's Filipino always
very proud of my roots and I display it
on my body a Filipino thing pretty
flying nice love it and another Filipino
song now that's something to be proud of
another big dude who is a very proud
Filipino is Brandon Vera born and raised
in Norfolk Virginia but he also spent
some of his childhood in taggawain
Quezon under the care of his Filipino
dad and stepmom which explains his
fluent Tagalog
[Music]
he even knows a lot about Philippine
history
a lot my favorite one is
garlic
when the Spanish colonized the
Philippines they tried to make us wear
clothes because they said yeah we were
Savages not wearing clothes
I guess the way that they fixed the
problem was they came up with a shirt
that was see-through
makes sense the tattoo in his bag is
also noticeable the letters are an
ancient Filipino writing system called
bybayan which reads Mundo
and the elements
he excelled in wrestling in his high
school days which earned him a four-year
athletic scholarship at all Dominion
University but he would later drop out
as he wanted to focus only on wrestling
he enlisted in the U.S Air Force and
joined the wrestling team but his career
would be cut short because he would
suffer multiple torn ligamentions right
elbow this gun medically discharged by
the Army nothing seems to be working in
Brandon's favor her but he never gave up
he rehabbed his elbow on his own until
he was strong enough to enter the
grappler's quest submission wrestling
competitions he didn't have a coach or a
trainer so this caught the attention of
Lloyd Irvin Brazilian Jiu Jitsu black
belt and Coach who invited him to train
with his MMA school he later then turned
Pro and went on to have an eight-fight
winning streak while finishing most of
his opponents with his signature kicks
[Music]
oh my God can you imagine the trauma
though he didn't quite reach the goal to
become a champion in the UFC he did
become one in one FC in a brutal fashion
by finishing all of his opponents
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
oh boy oh boy oh boy
[Applause]
oh my God
it's it's crazy you can see the shot he
was already 40 at the time and his age
he started catching up as he would lose
against myanmar's online song
in the present day Brandon Vera had
already retired and moved to the
Philippines
his own gym called The Alliance Training
Center pH to help train more young
Filipino MMA talents that's awesome
speaking of talent especially in Combat
Sports who would ever forget to mention
Manny Pacquiao
the goat in the old days
for the very best historically great
biter
he also has a case for greatest fighter
pound for pound who ever lived that's
too much power too much
the uh the senator right he's a senator
too
try to become presidents
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
oh my god oh wow
[Applause]
I think it's unbelievable to see grown
ass men just fall like that
after a punch
every time he fights the country's crime
rate drops to zero percent he's a master
not only inside but also
outside of something very kind the
influence is
yeah okay hello Philippines
[Laughter]
yeah yeah
oh wow even the biggest celebrities but
before getting all that Fame he had to
go through a lot of pain because he was
born and raised in General Santos at the
time of poverty
at age five he'd already seen dead and
decapitated bodies military and rebel
shootouts would happen just a few meters
away from her home so his family had no
choice but to leave and settled in the
nearby Province called sarangani
Manny's dad was barely there for them so
his uncle played the role of a father
figure
he started training Manny how to box and
also taught him how to fish at a very
young age to survive it's so inspiring
joined several amateur boxing
competitions and dominated all of them
but he wasn't earning enough because
most of what he got was just a bunch of
trophies and medals life was too hard
that it came to a point that Maddie's
dad butchered their own dog just to have
food on the table this was Manny's
wake-up call so at age 16 he traveled
alone to the city of Manila to become a
pro boxer without letting his mom know
because he knew she wouldn't allow him
back then
he made the gym his home and slept in
the ring every night in Manny's first
professional fight he had to lie about
his age just to get in his kid so he put
heavy objects in his pocket just to make
it into the flyweight division which
explains why he looked significantly
smaller than his opponents
look despite the handicap he still went
on to dominate and clean up the whole
flyweight division gaining him a world
title belt in the process
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
wow
[Music]
like the brain can't function anymore
in spite of this achievement Manny was
still relatively unknown to the world
nobody knew him to the point that the
announcers couldn't even read his name
properly tail of the tape for lisinola
ledwaba against Manny pacaya Pacquiao
mcmany's anonymity would only last until
this very night
two weeks notice
big right hand upstairs and now he's got
the guava pleading badly the eyes
that's a TKO victory for the very
impressive Manny Pacquiao I frankly had
never heard of him wow seen and heard of
him now and you want to see him again
he would then beat everyone in
bantamweight so he had to move up to
featherweight where he would earn the
nickname Pac-Man as he would devour most
of the Mexican monsters in the division
[Applause]
it came to a point that nobody in the
Federal Way division even the
lightweight division was willing to
fight him oh my god
there you go Mayweather that's the name
yes I have to believe that Floyd is
ducking so Manny was forced to move up
to two weight classes
Manny had to face his Idol himself Oscar
De La Hoya their size difference was so
noticeable that Manny's countrymen got
worried about him there was even a bill
that was passed just to stop the fight
from happening the objective is to
protect the pride operation
it's his life man
but the fight still happened and Manny
shocked everyone when he completely
dominated the much bigger fighter and
even made him give up in round number
eight
seriously
he gave up
Manny then went down away class to visit
the lightweight division to put Ricky
Hatton to sleep
[Applause]
so he fought in different classes
[Applause]
to go on a rampage against bigger
opponents one notable victim was Antonio
margarito who was arguably the biggest
fighter Manny ever faced what made his
matchup interesting was the drama
leading up to the fight because
margarito was so arrogant and insulted
Manny in multiple ways
[Music]
no this guy
look just like salt Pappy Manny did all
the Talking yeah absolutely
[Applause]
the other guy is taller too oh
um
[Music]
his face looks like a tomato dude
he messed him oh
garito has
a vicious beat down oh my God look at
his face of a significantly bigger man
Manny Pacquiao's career is definitely
full of interesting fights but it would
take hours if I had to share all of them
for now let me just give you a
perspective on the magnitude of his
achievements wow Manny is the only eight
weight Division World Champion there you
go wow 13 World titles across all of
them this is a feat no boxer has ever
done before he made it into the boxing
World fighting bigger guys and retired
biting even bigger guys he was the
people's David against the world's
Goliath he has the Heart of a Lion
Legacy he became an inspiration to many
aspiring young athletes yeah that's what
I said he has the Heart of a Lion well
surprisingly a young woman
heideline Diaz
she was only nine when she got
introduced ah yes I reacted to her she
won in the Olympics is to gain extra
money she liked it instantly as she
discovered that she was actually
stronger than her cousins who turned out
to be boys
they also live the life of poverty as
her parents struggled to make ends meet
heidelin was the fifth child among six
so his dad's income as a tricycle driver
and a part-time farmer was barely enough
to support them she had to borrow shoes
and uniforms for training and gladly
took had me downs going to the gym was
even a struggle for her because she
didn't have money for fair share
slap to avoid paying
despite all the difficulties heidelin
kept going and her hard work paid off as
she got selected as the Wild Card entry
in the 2008 Summer Olympics in China
making her the first ever female
weightlifter to compete for the
Philippines in the Olympics
she was only 17. making it to the
Olympics was a good achievement but
winning it all was the ultimate
Challenge in heidelin's case the gold
eluded her for more than a decade and
they polluted the whole country for
almost a century 97 years to be exact
her journey was full of setbacks and
crushing defeats but there was one thing
she didn't do
yeah I have a short where I react to
this man
yeah
that was what a year ago two years ago
[Music]
[Music]
laughs
[Music]
amazing
[Music]
amazing
wow
[Music]
yeah she got bigger
[Music]
meow back into gold medal position wow
a new olympic record with that lift at
126. the pressure now goes look at her
hi darling
[Music]
heidelin's last successful attempt was
124 and in order to win she had to break
the world record Again by adding three
more kilos to make it 127 which was
something she'd never lifted in the past
that is almost 300 pounds it's like
lifting a Batista
[Music]
she has to clean now she needs the jerk
can she recover there it is
your Olympic champion in the women's 55
kilo that's so great nice China the gold
go to the Philippines hide in India
that's so great she did just that
heideline Diaz took home the country's
first ever Olympic gold medal ladies and
gentlemen
of Philippines
[Music]

tear-jerking moment man even I'm feeling
a little choked up and I'm not even

had a great time with this second video
honestly he did a fantastic job it was
very focused on Filipinos that had
something to do with physical uh sports
right boxing UFC lift weightlifting
[Music]
um
you know uh wrestling so it was It was
kind of not brand new to me because I do
know those sports but I don't know much
about those Sports and I wasn't really
familiar with Filipinos in those Sports
except for Manny Pacquiao and Bautista
and yes the woman that uh
won the gold medal because I reacted to
her but this was awesome I had so much
fun and yeah I mean the quality is here
so I'll probably keep reacting to uh the
next ones if there are other videos that
will be made by casual Chaka but other
Filipinos who made the noise bro because
there are so many more believe you me
salt puppy let's go that guy is so
likable seriously
anyway
um I had a lot of fun to be honest for
like a few moments there I felt like a
Filipino or at least Filipino by heart I
don't know I just I just felt it it was
I choked up a little bit I really tried
not to to go there you know
um so yeah let me know in the comment
section below your thoughts on this I'm
