most proud of this year is to have been
given the chance to expand my
self-developed campaign unbreakable
when the world meet me last year as a

explained my story and what exactly
happened with me and how my unbreakable
campaign was born i started unbreakable

i found that women everywhere have the
same needs and the same ones and that is
to feel empowered and to be able to
stand up for themselves
that is exactly what i aimed to achieve
with unbreakable to make women feel
loved and cared for and empowered
and hopefully through my unbreakable
campaign i can help inspire change for
violence against women to finally end
