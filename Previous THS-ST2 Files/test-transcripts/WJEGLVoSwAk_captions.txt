Korean
okay who's who's uh doing showbiz in the
Philippines like Ryan bang like must
like yeah and before we start when I say
thanks to roody-poo Rudy song hey you
guys want to encourage us to make better
videos because some of these things that
we do get caught copyright we can't
monetize it so basically what that means
is we don't earn money from some of the
videos that we upload and again another
thing is we want to say to all the
haters who think our things are funny or
thing is not like good enough what we
say we say III both Athena bah bah oh
that's what you say to all the haters if
you're going through a hard time in
school in work and whatever you're your
life whatever your your your your your
going through if you're going through
our time just smile and raise up the
middle finger keep doing what you do
because if you give up that means that
they're right which is not good okay so
don't ever give up on every muff on what
you want because you're gonna make the
other person win the people who are
hating are probably just like hating
because they can't do it themselves
oh no burn you want any other like oh
and they just say negative things
because they're just pessimistic idiots
you know so always hang around with
people who are encouraging to you we're
obvious thing about the future yes we
can do what you really believe and just
do it you know from the poo so hey Musa

time
[Music]
[Music]
this hard you
massacres are
what ha ha
Oh God it's over burn overall he's got
burned right there
oh oh just elaborate II was reading
guys what's this doesn't like him
she probably Korean like half Korean or
something like that so stupid
his hair is too he's too hair is like no
there's a story there's a plot but it's
just a but it's just I don't buy it like
I'll be fine like like I like chick
flicks don't get me right cry I like
notebook like that I like no question
like once I just watched once like I
watched musical New York who's the best
I mean it's very you know chiefly key
but it's believable right this the plot
in itself can be believable but the way
they they made it like like with all the
hair like that like so like we
have to come without I don't know I mean
like you know they could have like kind
of made it more kind of like subtle in a
way you guys understand it's just
me I just couldn't buy it you bought it
was your stupidity okay I would - I
would - I was downloading Tori
don't support how you won
just downloaded illegally I'm just
kidding yeah but that's what I thought
about it but other than that the PUC has
good voice
sure sure she's pretty good good singer
I think I heard one of his sucks all
what it's linking hands I think I heard
one of his songs like he was in Tagalog
with I think I think the Monaco but I
think that I think the gal of one was
better for sure yeah I think it's
Tagalog singing is more emotional you
could say stuff like that in Korean is
more I think it's more unique because a
Korean guy singing Tagalog and the last
girl who came out the second girl was
cute the Korean girl I bet she's a
talker that's my in-depth reaction let's
always do like a how many points did you
know 0 to 10 rating ok so I'll see me
not everything the overall the music
video singing production everything
give this a five I mean six six and yeah
you liked it you're this case of
criticized disease they liked it bro but
oh I did which one do you like it was
just the if I could if I cried out get
hate but it was six I think right though
the guy didn't need to take action
message
his voice was good that's why I give six
but he's acting I'm not that good it's
not believable
okay whatever head so you know what to
do guys in garages a facebook Instagram
follow the journey Facebook Instagram
