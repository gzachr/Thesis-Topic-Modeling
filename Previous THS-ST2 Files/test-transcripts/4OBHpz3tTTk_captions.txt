this is the bus terminal we are going to
Montreal can we and we have a meet and
greet right when we get there Bob right
guys we're here on megabot I love this
week so we reserved RJ you ready for
laundry Oh
yes that content muncher guys this manga
bus is the bomb we paid a little extra
to have a table and turns out these are
free they weren't reserved so we
basically have all of this room and I
can edit because they have an outlet
that runs to the bottom there another
cool thing is this bus has Wi-Fi can't
beat it
also of course the omnipresent Tim
Hortons so we're going to be in
Montville for the next three days and
then we'll be back in Toronto for about
a day and a half before flying back to
Manila alright so here's the beautiful
countryside on the way to Montreal
now Toronto is a city in the province of
Ontario I find a lot of people think
Ontario is a city it's not Ontario is
the name of the entire province and it's
a very large province but now we're
traveling to another problems the
province of Quebec which happens to be
much more French so Ontario as you can
see here it still looks very Ontario ish
it's very English but as soon as we
enter the province of Quebec it
completely changes the ambiance it's
really interesting French Canada is
really a wonderful place
[Music]
we picked up a few passengers along the
way but Arjun so funny looking face is
the grand story I looked at that I'm
like wow did you take that picture from
online this is no that's pretty good RJ
you're getting better
you're getting better
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
Oh
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
Oh Reverend Boyd what we are here in
beautiful Montreal Canada crew all right
we're taking the taxi to our hotel now
see guys this is the Basilica
Marylyn du monde
mary queen of Eire cathedral isn't that
beautiful
san emotion I don't know the voice god
this here is ending street and I used to
always party here a stable school bye
bye
all right guys we drop the luggage off
now I'm hungry
we gotta eat check-in is 3:00 p.m. so we
have time see the buildings look really
neat right so see everything's in French
here in Quebec so are you a means to
rent so on the corners you'll find that
d'Epinay basically is the French version
of the sari-sari store it's a
convenience store you can buy taking
there like alcohol nice medicine
anything you buy a convenience or snacks
no I used to go there to buy my beer in
Ontario you can only buy alcohol in a
beer store or liquor store but here in
Montreal you can buy it at the demo or
anywhere really RJ and I are jaywalking
right now here in Montreal they're a bit
more loose you know in a lot of ways
Quebec reminds me of the Philippines
just the mentality like here people are
kind of they like to play they like to
party and there are a lot less formal so
in effect there tends to be a bit of
rule breaking here and there or there a
little bit more lenient with the rules
all right we're gonna have some Thai
food guys and here's something
interesting
so for English people entre means the
main course right but for French people
on claims mean
the entrance meal so it's like the
appetizers RJ has a salad hot salad
we're good yeah good then mean chicken
wings
mmm I'm sure these are yummy too sad
wings ooh I like that
the freshly ground peper now this city
really means a lot to me because if you
see my draw my life video you'll know
that I kind of came here to escape
immediately after I gave up trying to
pursue entity so imagine after trying to
make it in show business here in Canada
and then also in the Philippines for
attempts I decided you know what
it's I can't do it anymore I kind of
decided to give up I it was hard to
create a career in entertainment um and
you know I felt defeated as a young
adult having worked you know towards
becoming an entertainer I even dropped
out of school because I wanted to pursue
entertainment and then when I couldn't
get any contract in the Philippines I
decided you know what I'm gonna I'm
gonna throw in the towel I give up
everyone was right I I should have you
know invested in something more concrete
and so I decided I'm just going to start
a fresh new page I'm going to move to a
place where I don't know anybody I'm
going to start a new life
start fresh for people don't know me and
so I kind of came here and then got a
quote-unquote normal job but the reason
why it means a lot to me is because when
I was here and I escaped from the
entertainment bubble you know struggling
to be a starving artist
I was reinterred by this city I was
reinstall did I know that was exactly
what I needed and I'll talk more about
that later on in the blog
but Montreal really means a lot to me
because of that

the way it is for everybody like I
remember riding the subway and listening
to the students they'll be talking
full-out French and then they'll break
into English spontaneously and then back
to French right and all my friends they
always spoke three languages or two
languages you know they were completely
bilingual or trilingual which I totally
totally appreciate here in Montreal hey
