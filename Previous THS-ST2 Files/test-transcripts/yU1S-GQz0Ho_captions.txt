personally i love working from home
maui said maui said yeah i released my
video about morissette
well for me i released it this morning
but for you guys
it was yesterday night and you really
enjoyed it so i'm happy about that

doesn't hurt the eyes so i'm really
happy that you guys are loving it

after all an asap not into video from
abs-cbs abs-cbn and you know how they
are with their
um you know copyright stuff
all right people we got our new gen
divas
so we're talking about janine burden
right we're talking about uh ella nympha
we're talking about who else
you know sometimes i forget the names
we're talking about and
uh who's the name of the other one i
forget stephanie there you go stephanie
dimaran
thank you uh
overlap good night okay christian good
night
and sheena bellarmino there you go
there you go mia thank you so much
all right let's do this let's do this
thing
i'm ready oh
okay i hope you guys can see
the uh the screen right yeah i think you
can
let's make it bigger like this
and uh we can start
and if i have something to say i will
pause the video and
you know say whatever i have to say
let's go
[Music]
pause is this a sarah geronimo song
because sarah geronimo's face is all
over the place
so i'm guessing that's that's what
what's happening here
[Music]
and keep in mind that i'm probably not
familiar with these
opm songs okay
see um i like the transition you know i
think ella did a great job
transitioning but i wonder if it was
the the right time to make a transition
you know because
that's the moment that we were waiting
for we were waiting for
janine to belt right so why start the
transition there
[Music]
okay so the liftoff of that note was
pitchy but the rest is good
[Music]
wait i want to rewind that part
it went like a little bit down so it was
a little pitchy
[Music]
hey angeline janine and she did a
fantastic job i'm very happy with her
performance
uh before we transition to probably ella
have you guys heard her single do it
man i was pleasantly surprised with that
single i reacted to it and seriously i
was not expecting to enjoy it that much
especially the fact that she sang it
almost perfectly on the wish bus
was very enjoyable so if you have a
chance
check it out uh the texture of janine's
voice oh yeah
oh yes the her texture is just
everything like seriously it's
everything which makes it very
interesting because apparently she's
singing
uh sarah geronimo medley right so it's
interesting to hear a sarah
random medley with that kind of vocal
texture
uh the sound no if i put it too loud it
will hurt
my ears for the volume so yeah
here i'm gonna increase just a little
bit more but it will hurt my ears
[Music]
[Music]
oh
[Music]
get down
[Music]
okay so i don't understand why was
ella nympha uh singing with janine
burden
you know they made it feel like there
was some type of transition
but that wasn't the case because she
stopped singing
and then we transitioned into this next
song
like after janine burden finished uh
her own performance right so that wasn't
necessary and i felt like it just ruined
a little bit
the belting part of janine burton you
know
i just didn't see the point of that but
so far
ella never is singing beautifully
[Music]
me
[Music]
oh my god did you
hear that part you know the belting with
the
uh with the crash
that was epic man she handled it super
well she has
a strong big voice man ella
see here the transition is perfect
because sheena bellarmino is not singing
over ella nympha you know she is not
ruining
ruining her belting part you know she
waited
for ella ninfa to finish and then she
started singing
that's good
[Music]
oh
[Music]
called my son
yeah i feel like they handled the
harmony pretty well
[Music]
uh red butterfly when i said ruined i
did this okay i put quotes
ruined i didn't really mean ruined it's
just for me i would have liked to hear
janine's belt without ella's voice on
top of it
that's what i meant that's it
such a powerful voice
[Music]
hello jennifer tantativa from the
netherlands bruh that's awesome
[Music]
it's so pretty
uh all about eloy pasajo says
i know i lived in toronto before i moved
here in the us
i've been to montreal a couple of times
doing my layover there just
maybe hopefully that's cool
[Music]
hello tv
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
um
i love that part part
[Music]
that was a nice explosion and hello
to where is it where is it where is it
um oh man it goes by fast
the message is ah
i missed it
[Music]
[Music]
wow
damn we gotta hear her again i'm sorry
damn
yo up alarmy no okay
i see you
[Music]
hey
[Music]
are you kidding me are you freaking
kidding me yo i think
i really like this song this song
is awesome because i really love the
runs of this song especially when they
built
man they killed it sheena bellarmino has
handled it
really well and then zephany's
transition do you know how
hard it is to do what zephany is doing
right now
like picking it up at the highest
when china belormino is belting right
you have to pick up there
all of a sudden
bro that was fantastic i gotta
listen to it again i gotta
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
[Music]
um
[Applause]
[Music]
[Music]
is the one that people compared the most
i think to sarah geronimo so i guess the
expectation for zephany
are a little bit higher than the other
girls you know
oh i know this song
[Music]
yes thank you for your message
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
oh
[Music]
let's go man the parts
[Music]
do you did you notice how the the music
stopped
for drama effect i love it it makes the
the the the the song feel more dramatic
check it out
it's when shena belormino was singing
ah i missed it again wait
[Music]
[Music]
i got chills
[Music]
[Music]
wow look at these girls
charlie's angels i know charlie's angel
is supposed to be three right but come
on man
[Music]
oh my god that was insane
guys um this is not the first time that
i react to the new gen divas right like
i've done two
previous lives for the new gen divas and
both lives
they were singing uh english songs right
i think the first one was uh
uh what was it oh man
i don't remember but the second one it
was more like rock and roll like rockish
english songs right this is my favorite
and it's rare that you know i relate
more to
opm performances or opm music because
they're singing in tagalog right
or filipino but this time they
sang so well it was so
impressive i'm so happy
like i got chills at the end like
seriously because
their harmonies were on point
when they were belting they were on
point
the dynamics were on point there was a
lot of
power in their belting you know and it
was on point on
pitch it was so freaking good
shout out to the band the band
was also epic man like wow that was
extremely impressive
it's a shame that there was basically no
audience right
watching them do this like live audience
it's a shame that was so freaking
good and i do wish that the gma network
also put a little bit more uh reverb
on the microphones like uh you know sf
nothing told slash ibs cbn
does because it just makes it sound so
much
better that was so freaking
good man wow
like honestly i almost had like zero
complaints here because it was
really impressive and if i had to choose
one
just one that really made me happy
it would be very hard for me it's
basically a draw
between uh sheena bellarmino trust me
i'm even uh surprised i'm saying that
you know because i do consider that
sheena bellarmino
is not mature enough uh
to to be at the level of the other girls
but here
she was basically my favorite her and
zephany di marana
zephany man i'm impressed not only by
her voice
but i'm impressed by her poise okay
and the way she is handling herself on
stage
my god i am very
happy with this performance usually
i go for janine because of her vocal
texture you know but here no
she was not the best in my opinion but
overall
they all killed it it was extremely
impressive and i'm so happy i reacted to
this
i am crossing my fingers uh so that this
video
isn't blocked and even if it's blocked
i'm still recording it
so you know i might be able to like edit
it and still put it up
i don't know we'll see by five
by by this by far is their best
performance i agree
shelley vest 100 in my opinion it's
their best
they're getting used to uh working
together
you know harmonizing together and
everything so
i agree 100 this was my favorite
and i did not expect it which makes it
even
better you know what i mean
oh daniel lopez thank you so much for

you've been live but finally i was able
to catch you live
