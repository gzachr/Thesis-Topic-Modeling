you have to bring your personality
and watch your bloody mouth this is a
very family orientated audience
we don't we don't want to hear none of
that bad language
how am i supposed to introduce you i
didn't plan for this do i need water
i know you don't need water
so
can you just but do you want to start
then because you seem to be
the one that's ready to do this i'm not
ready to do this not with you
well what do you say to them when you
say hello to them say hello
i've been recording soul time oh my god
hello everybody
[Laughter]
okay we're gonna do a different video
today me and mrs whippy just came back
from the barrio fiesta
filipino festival and we've got some
food left over for mum to try
mum welcome to the channel hi everybody
we're to make this a quick video we're
just testing the waters we're going to
try one of these i have to eat the whole
thing but
try once filipino butt
so i've never tried filipino food before
oh at all
forgot to mention that there'll be a
title
sweet it's sweet and it's soft
it's not a lot of the bread tastes like
that when i went to philippines
always buy bread because basically like
a sticky bun without
without icing it's not bad i like that
oh my god who was the cute danian out
here
okay now this is a purple yam
with custard bun uber
inside yes but it's a different type of
custard it's not just a
it's not the yellow custard you're
thinking of but
hang on let me just you guys know what
these are
[Music]
i like that one better
i don't like that one oh my god we've
only got four things to try because
i need a drink of water so i can taste
them
hopefully to cheddar must yourselves if
you're going
for the peens one day well that's not
bad now it's probably because you've
never tried ube either
they've got ube and like everything's
got uber that's nice so that's like
caramel to me
so you're going to finish that later
later so yeah this is going to be a
short video because we only got four
things if you watched the previous video
so this is all the food my son loves
well this is
like not even really a portion this is
just like
this is just a little no no no that's
slice that's the best one
i'm gonna try this this is uh mr
whippy's favorite
out of what we tried oh so basically
yama custard it's a bun and that sort of
custardy stuff in it
this icing and cheese on top oh
no don't i don't want to hear it
you have to try it no no no you have to
eat it with your hands
with my hands no because you got to bite
into it
don't be shy
the frame in the frame
beautiful
[Music]
i thought you said you were well
cultured and kiwi food
she breaks oh that's delicious
what's that cheese it's cheese it's
sweet
what is it that can't be normal cheese
though
oh what's normal cheese i don't know
what type of cheese it is but
it's sweet it doesn't it does it taste
like it should be together
no
i don't know how you expect to go for
the peas in hindi food it's very sweet
but you wouldn't know that was cheese
water is it a dessert well yeah
just try a little bit more
now i can taste it better i'm excited
because i ain't got the flesh but
thoughts again after the tasting very
sweet
but did you enjoy it after i took
another bite
would you would i eat it again i'd
probably have to have a half or one
night it's too big
okay this is the lucky dust tank you've
taken forth is that sweet
this is definitely sweet this is my
favorite this is definitely what reminds
me of the philippines is basically
i'll put the name on video this is a
dessert
because they obviously filipinos love
rice and they rice with everything
they also make it dessert out of it so
that's rice it's rice and i know you
like rice
cream rice so you shouldn't like this
technically
if it's pudding i have a drink so i've
done it there's no way you cannot like
this
not not like this not like this
that's why i say the full icing because
it's the best out of all them
so it's rice mostly rice and
others ingredients
that's the best one see that's how i
know i just
know that's what saved it
[Music]
yeah that's the best one it's like
what's the syrup though i like that one
so there's the texture too
i like that one the best because it's
not overly sweet that one's a little bit
too sweet for me
the cheese at the top
[Music]
well at least we have a winner
[Music]
that one that's just that's just a
little this is just a little snippet of
their food like this is just a mouthful
there's so much other food you haven't
tried
that you can try if you want to go to
the philippines
i do want to go with it with dan and his
mother
[Laughter]
what you said you wanted to do yeah and
dan said he wants to as well but
obviously you guys aren't the healthiest
of people oh
so i'm better than you just have your
own thing so
that's nice i like that one the best
there's the winner okay
that's good well
thank you for watching this is the first
time possibly the last time you've seen
my mother in the video
see everybody see you next time
