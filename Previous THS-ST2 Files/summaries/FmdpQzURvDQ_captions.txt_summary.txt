Abie Florendo is a bookkeeper under BossedUp PH. She was an Accounting Supervisor in an amusement company. She got her first bookkeeping job on Facebook. "I feel that that job was really for me. It's because that client that you have given to me, the system that they are using is Quickbooks Online" "My day-to-day transactions include entering bills, reconciliations, and checking the accounts receivables" "I have clients that I attend to daily, some are every Wednesday, and I have a client that I attending to every sixteenth and first day of the month" "Wow! Seven!" "Because inside your agency, Boss, I have 3 clients." "Yeah." "So, aside from your agency,. I have 4 more clients." Abie: "Among all platforms, FreeUp has the highest bidding, $7 to $75 per hour" "On Upwork, I bid package rate for project-based clients" "For the clean-up, I ask for 50% downpayment and 50% upon completion" Abie is using Quickbooks Online, Wave App and Buildium for her bookkeeping clients. She is also using a VPN to protect her clients' bank accounts. "It's better to use the premium version. But for VPN, there are free ones that you could use." "If you are accessing bank accounts and anything that involves money, I feel like it is safer if you will use premium accounts to make sure that no one can know your login details and the likes" Abie says bookkeepers need to study the basic accounting principle. They need to know how to use Quickbooks and Xero app. Abie advises bookkeepers to charge per hour first to familiarize themselves. Abie is a freelance bookkeeper. She conducts free webinars on how to start, the basics that they need to know about bookkeeping, how to create a proposal as a bookkeeper, she says. The most important part of financial statement is the balance sheet, profit and loss, cash flow, and then equity. All cloud-based accounting software works pretty the same. My tip for you is to first study the basic accounting principles. From there, the system will be easy to use."
