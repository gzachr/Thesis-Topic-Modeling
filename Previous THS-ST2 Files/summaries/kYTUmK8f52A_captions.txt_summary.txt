When he was in high school the one class that I learned the most from wasn't math, it wasn't science. It wasn't English. It was elective class called Peer group counseling. People had to listen to others before they would speak. "I had all of these impressions of people from the very beginning. I saw some people that I didn't like at all" "I started to realize that when somebody acted a certain way around me on the outside there was probably something deeper going on in the inside" The Philippines is a very diverse country, says CNN's John Sutter. Sutter: "My first impressions when I was here is that people are the most kind, most respectful most sweet people, anyone" I never knew how impatient I was until I moved to the Philippines. I never knew that some things that I took for granted how quick they could be, could literally take so long. There's an old country song, it has a lyrics that says, God gives me patience now. And that's what I feel like a bit here.
