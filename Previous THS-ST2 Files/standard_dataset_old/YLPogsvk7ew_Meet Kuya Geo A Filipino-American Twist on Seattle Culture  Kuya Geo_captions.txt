- Bruce Lee, super focus.
Getting ready for combat.
And then the camera will zoom
 in 'cause it was the 70s.
As a kid growing up in
Hawaii, Bruce Lee to me
was the only Asian
  person I ever saw
in movies and TV who kicked ass.
Bruce Lee was a martial artist,
movie star, philosopher,
poet, man of the people, and
 just another Seattle dude.
He went to Garfield High School,
University of Washington,
met the love of his life here.
Bruce Lee started his
 freshman year at U-Dub
the same year that the
space needle was built.
I5 construction had just
  begun that very same year.
The Seattle we know now,
the embryo of it started
when Bruce Lee was around.
It was the hip-hop
generation that created
what we know now is Bruce Lee.
I mean, you can see the
photoshopped Bruce Lee t-shirts,
where he's like a Bruce Lee
with headphones and turntables.
Every hip-hop artist who
comes to town on tour,
they're not out here
 catching fish at Pike Place
or going on the Space Needle,
they're going to
visit Bruce Lee.
Seattle in the
 60s, you're looking
at the Civil Rights Movement
 unravel all over the country,
and then you're realizing
  you're living in a city
that itself is segregated.
The carts and the stereotype
 of the Asian male,
which sadly still
 exists to this day.
The meek Asian male,
very familiar with that.
I've been teased with it,
but I also have thought
  constantly Long Duk Dong.
- What's happening, hot stuff?
- You know, the kid
 from Goonies, who I
 wanted to root for.
He was cool to me,
come to find out he's the
  nerd to everybody else.
All those stereotypes,
 I think, Bruce Lee,
he was very aware of them.
- That in the United
  States, I think something
about the Oriental,
 I mean the true
Oriental should be shown.
- Hollywood sure as heck hasn't.
- You better believe it, man.
I mean, it's always the pigtail
and bouncing around chop-chop
with the eyes
 framed and all that.
- Instead of looking at the
 stereotype and being like,
these Asian dudes on our
  screen are like sidekicks
and meek people, I'm just gonna
be a bad ass all the time.
Well, guess what?
Now, you end up with a
  whole 'nother caricature.
He wrote poetry, and he
 trained hard and kicked ass.
He knew that the
  best way to fight
a one-dimensional
  portrayal is to be
as multidimensional as possible.
I watched my
 six-year-old son watch
Enter the Dragon for
 the very first time.
He had the same exact face,
 pretty sure that I had.
Whenever Bruce Lee triumphed,
 he was like, "Yeah, me too."
To see someone
for that community,
 for that identity,
for that racialized
identity was important.
So, long story short,
 Bruce Lee made it
a little more cooler
 to be an Asian dude.
There's a mythology
 that surrounds him
and his legacy and
 what he represented.
He symbolized what can be done
as an Asian male
 growing up in America.
