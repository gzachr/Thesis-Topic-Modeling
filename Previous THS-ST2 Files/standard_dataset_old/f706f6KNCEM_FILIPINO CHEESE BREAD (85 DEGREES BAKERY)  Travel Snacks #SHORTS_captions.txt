you are not ready for this i got some filipino 
breads when i was in florida and ever since  
then i've been searching for filipino sweet 
breads because they're delicious so somebody  
recommended 85 degrees bakery i guess they have 
a thousand locations and they have one here  
in the san diego area so i went and got my 
favorite cheese bread on their website it  
says it's like taiwanese also is this filipino 
like taiwanese i don't know it's still delicious  
sweet cream cheese filled with cheddar cheese on 
top which sounds kind of gross but it's delicious
this is sweet delicious cream cheese the 
little cheddar cheese on top gives it  
like this little weird tang delicious 
five snack bags for sure it's a snack
