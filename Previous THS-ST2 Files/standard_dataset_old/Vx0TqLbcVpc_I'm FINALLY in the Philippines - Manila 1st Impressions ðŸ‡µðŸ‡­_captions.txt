-Oh this?
Yeah
- Where you from? 
-Are you Filipino?
-Hiiiii
I’m on this very special vehicle,
and after two years of planning,
I'm finally in the Philippines.
And this video
I'm going to cover my first impressions
of the capital city of Manila
It’ s 7 p.m..
And I'm in Manila.
I've been traveling for the last 19
or 20 hours.
Very little sleep in the middle
on a bench in Bangkok airport.
Immigration was a breeze. The person
checking my passport and visa.
was just so nice and so friendly
I’m here, waiting for my luggage
now for like the last 30 minutes.
One thing I really like about this
is that there is this TV over there.
You can see the people
that are unloading the luggage
I see my bag.
It's weird.
There's this
extra tag on my bag
that says it was like security
checked at the Bangkok airport.
I have no clue why.
I'm sweaty and smelly,
but I have my stuff
I want to try to go get, like, a
grab,
which is basically the Uber
here in Philippines.
I can go get that straight
because I got like
esim before I came here,
it seems to be working well,
I’ll leave links to that in the description.
This is not a sponsored video, but
I do find them really helpful,
especially when I'm like,
right, arriving in a country
Can I get $100
exchanged?
Here you go
Thank you.
I just got like $100
exchanged to like 5390
and it's like big bills.
And they gave me like these
huge interesting looking coins.
I'm going to try to find a Grab
and pay with cash.
And it seems like this airport
is pretty easy to navigate.
It's a bit crowded
because this is one of the most
uncrowded cities on the planet,
but it's still very organized.
Maybe that's my car.
Hi
Thank you.
-Nadir?
Nadir
Yes.
Good afternoon, people.
It's like.. that is interesting.
Good afternoon, people.
It's 1230 and I'm in Malate,
which is inside
Metro Manila,
which is actually like 16
cities, by the way.
I got to my hostel
last night around like 830,
and it was pretty dark so I
didn’t really film much.
Just went to bed and slept for 12 hours.
Today, I'm
heading out and
Imma try to explore the city
and my hostel is like a really,
really cool one.
Like really chill
budget backpacker hostel.
I've got like a private small room
so I could spread out my electronics
and my drones
and my charging stuff, you know,
without having to worry
about taking up too much space.
But yeah, it gets hot.
I woke up this morning
because it's so hot.
It's like
32 degrees Celsius,
90 degrees Fahrenheit,
and a fan is not enough to keep you cool.
So I see the grocery store in front of me
where I got like my water
and snacks yesterday night.
And right next to me
is this place called KTV Room, Karaoke TV.
Apparently, it's a very popular
thing here to come
and just like sing karaoke
for a good time.
The guy at my hostel..
-Hello!
What up brother!?
People are so friendly!
A very common thing here
is come to these bars that are KTV bars
and apparently you go and sing karaoke
and then like
you pick..
This sounds weird.
You pick one of the staff
who is like a lady who comes
and just cheers
you on as you sing karaoke
and says
that you're really good at singing.
I haven't experienced this personally,
but the guy at the hostel
was telling me that.
That's really interesting.
And when I was walking around the area,
a couple of guys
very friendly
who like work at these places,
were coming
and telling me like: 
“Yo come in”
“500 pesos, whatever, blah, blah, blah”
“Come join the KTV bar experience.”
Hello kiddo. Hi.
This kid is fascinated by my camera,
So I don't exactly know what
this is called,
but I got to try this out at some point.
What's this
-Shumai
Shumai
Is this chicken?
Chicken?
-Bird
That’s a hotdog?
- (I’m from) Philippines, Manila
-I live in Makati.
Makati! 
Thank you
Was going to eat this
and he said I should get some sauce,
-Sweeet and hot
sweet and hot.
Okay.
Thank you.
Salamat?
-Salamat
-Speaking Tagalog? 
I'm trying to learn.
Yeah. Thank you very much.
is Salamat?
Time to try it out the chicken hotdog with sauce
This is so, so much sauce,
Interesting. It is sweet and spicy.
Definitely sweet
From what I hear, people
eat a lot of fast food
in the Philippines.
The day’s
definitely starting off
in that direction.
That was some very interesting food.
This is definitely a city
of very sharp contrasts.
On one side,
you got like these big high rise
buildings right
next to where I was saying,
But you go like one block inside
and there's like these almost
very local places
where there's clearly people
that are not very well off
And there's like these horse
drawn carriages
that seem to only exist
in this part of the city,
from what I understand,
definitely not a popular motor
transportation, but tourists like it.
Someone else is blogging behind me right there
It is so sunny right now.
So I'm in the beach
called the Manila Bay Walk.
Dolomite Beach, I think it's called.
And it's like a pretty nice beach area.
The water doesn't seem like
the cleanest place ever,
So I guess no one really goes
for a swim here.
But there's definitely a lot of some of
the beaches in the Philippines.
Don't worry about that.
Just not over here.
So the Philippines is actually a country
of more than seven
and a half thousand islands
that are like dispersed
throughout this archipelago.
We're on Luzon right now,
which is the biggest island of them all,
with a population of like 60 million.
And I think it's more
than like 50%
of the whole population
of the Philippines.
This is actually one of the most populous
islands in the whole world.
I think it's fourth after Java, Honshu
from Japan and great Britain.
So a lot of people on this island
right here,
You could definitely tell
this is a port area
because you see a lot of cargo
ships and stuff
docked not too far from this beach right here.
So I’m entering a shady little park area called
Rizal Park, with lots of nice
little food stalls near to the entrance.
This is a really fancy park, actually,
and there's some party music coming from
right there.
I don't know why.
Funny because there is a place in LA
where I used to live that looks just like this.
And people used to take a lot of pictures
over here too.
So people have lived in the Philippines
for tens of thousands of years
and different
waves of people have come
from different parts of Asia
and settled on these islands.
The earliest settlers were Negritos,
and after that, waves
and waves of
Austronesians came in
who make up a majority
of the population of the people
living here today.
And if you want to find out
more about the history of the people
of the Philippines, in the long run,
you can check out
the National Museum of Anthropology
just right behind me
right there in Rizal Park.
Something really interesting
is at the lowest administrative level
in the Philippines today is
still called barangays,
which probably originates
from the word balangay,
which are these boats
that the ancient settlers
used to come to these different islands,
Something that you'll notice
right off the bat
when you come to the Philippines
is that people like to smile a lot.
Even when the security of the museum
was telling me that I can't film there,
he was like super smiley about it,
and he appreciated
that I was smiling back at him too.
So that is really nice.
Right behind me you're going
to see these very ancient walls.
And with these walls
start the story of modern day
Philippines
So in 1521,
this Portuguese explorer
who was under the directions
of the Spanish crown,
was trying to circumnavigate the earth
for the first time.
He was trying to be
one of the first people
to go around the whole globe.
And he arrived
on the eastern islands
of the Philippines.
And when he arrived,
he sort of claimed the islands for
Spain,
which in turn started
the Spanish colonization of the area
By the way
Magellan never made it back to Spain.
He died in the Philippines
in this dumb battle,
but some of his crewmates
actually managed to go around the earth
and go back to Spain,
eventually. Took a long time.
Something really interesting
that a lot of people
don't know
is along with Magellan on his crew,
was the slave that he had bought
from Malacca in Malaysia today,
like ten years before that.
And when that guy
arrived in the Philippines,
he spoke the local language.
So no one really knows
where exactly he was from.
But it is a theory
that he might have actually
been from the Philippines.
So this guy, Enrique, might have been
the first ever person
to go around the whole globe.
It was the year 1543
and the Spanish explorer named
all these islands
Las Islas Filipinas
in honor of King
Felipe at the second of Spain.
And that's where the name of the islands
Philippines actually comes from.
So in 1565, Spain officially started
colonizing the place from New Spain,
which was Mexico at the time.
And in 1571, the Spanish conquistador
named Legazpi
came here and claimed
the city of Manila
as the capital
of the Spanish colony, in a sense.
And he took advantage
of the territorial divide
between the different
like Hindu and Muslim factions
that were ruling the area.
And he used that to set up
bars base here
and formed the City Council of Manila
inside the walls of where
I'm standing right now.
And he called this Intramuros,
which literally means within the walls.
And that is the name
of the oldest district of Manila,
which I'm
standing in right now,
which is within these ancient big walls.
So before the Spanish came along,
there was no country
called the Philippines
with the islands that we see today.
However, there were
a lot of different island
nations or kingdoms,
and there were settlements
and a lot of the places
where you have big cities today
and there were just settlements
that were trading with regional powers
like China at the time
and were big trade hubs
even long before the Spanish arrived.
Unfortunately, a lot of intramuros
was destroyed during the World
War 2 bombings during the war.
But thankfully a lot of
it has been restored
and a lot of it managed to survive.
And by the way, Manila, back in the day,
everything was inside these walls.
There was nothing outside.
Now it's a very different story.
It's pretty cool that you can like
walk around inside these walls
and get an idea
of what life used to be like.
You know, way back in the day,
Some kids are dancing behind me.
The Spanish only left the Philippines
like a hundred years ago,
a little bit more than that.
So you see very heavy influences
of Spanish colonialism,
not just in Intramuros,
but like literally everywhere
around the country,
all the places, all the streets.
A lot of cities have Spanish names.
The guy who sort of settled in Manila,
Legazpi, has his own city
named after him,
which I'm probably going to
in a couple of days.
But it's not just the name of the places.
Interestingly, it's
also in the names of the peoples.
So a lot of people,
like almost everyone I've met here,
has Hispanic names
right
in the middle of Intramuros,
there's a Starbucks.
There's a lot of American chains here.
More on that later.
So along with colonialism
the Spanish also brought
Catholicism into the Philippines,
and it's still 80% Catholic country
to this day.
And behind me
is the Church of Saint Augustine,
which is the oldest stone church
in the whole country,
which was built in the year 1607.
And is now a UNESCO World Heritage site.
And there's some religious ceremony
going on behind me right now.
I want to go inside
and see if I can check it out
firsthand.
Some people are actually
getting married back there.
And I think
I almost like walked into that.
Thankfully,
I didn't go too far
before I noticed what was going on.
So not too far from that church
We just came from inside Intramuros
also the Manila Cathedral,
which is this huge cathedral
This place is bigger than it even
looks like from the outside.
I mean, look at this.
So they had me take off my hat
when I was walking,
and at first
I thought it was for security.
Then I realized that it's disrespectful
in a church to be wearing a hat.
So don't do that
if you go to a cathedral or a church.
This is the Intramuros fire station
right here in the middle of it.
Important structure.
I just entered Fort Santiago,
which is still inside Intramuros
and when I was walking in,
the lady asking for tickets
was talking to me in Filipino
because I think I look a little Filipino,
which is probably why
I have like a lot of viewers,
if you're watching from the Philippines,
My second biggest base is the Philippines
after Bangladesh.
So thanks to all
80,000 of you
who watch my videos
from the Philippines on Facebook,
I'll try to do justice to your country
for now, I’’ll try to do justice to your city.
Got some kids dancing
professionally down here, too.
Yeah.
So at the edge of Fort Santiago,
you'll see the Pasig River,
which is sort of this old river
that flows through the heart of Manila.
This goes all the way into Manila Bay.
And once the Spanish came
and sort of established Manila
as the capital of their new
Spanish East Indies
colony, which included
the Philippines, Guam
and a couple of other islands,
This sort of became the western hub
of the transpacific trade.
For the first time,
there was trade being done
across the Pacific
from the Spanish Americas,
all the way to Eastern Asia,
and this became one of the world's first
global cities.
You know, once
Manila was set up as this trade hub
for the first time
ever across the world,
there was this uninterrupted network
of trade routes
that went around the whole world,
starting from Spain
to the Americas now to Asia
and back to Europe again.
Speaking of trade and business,
there's a couple of things
I need to buy,
including shorts
with zippable pockets,
because I'm having to wear
jeans everywhere.
And for that I'm not going to go here.
But to that side of that river,
to this market called Divisoria.
And we
got some
people playing basketball in sandals
right on the street.
-Oh, thank you.
Is that Steph Curry?
-Where you from?
Bangladesh
-Subscribed 
Thank you brother. Salamat
People are just so friendly here.
So I saw some kids back there.
They were playing some games,
I thought at first,
but then they were like,
no, we're gambling.
You want to go to Divisoria?
200?
-250?
200 is on Grab.
Okay.
Do you have change for 1000?
-Yeah. Yeah
You do?
Okay, can I sit in the front?
Ok, yeah.
-Where you come from?
Bangladesh
My man here is super friendly.
Divisoria is, like,
good for the street market right?
-Yeah.
I need to buy some
cheap clothes. I’ll buy shorts
because it's too hot for jeans right now.
And there's,
like, a hole in my jeans,
So that whole segment
in Divisoria
ended up being so much action
packed that I've decided I'm going
to make a different video out of that
because it's worth it's own video.
So right now I'm in Quiapo,
which is another district
not too far from Divisoria,
and I'm in another market
heading towards this cool spot
Okay not going to like this is also
looks a lot like Divisoria.
So right now I'm in Plaza Miranda,
which is probably
one of the most recognizable plazas
in all of metro Manila
in front of this church
that if I remember
right, was also built
during the Spanish colonial era.
Okay,
so let's go back to history for a second.
So of course, the Spanish came
and colonized the place
and that lasted more than 300 years.
But then in 1896,
the first Filipino revolution happened.
It lasted like two years,
which ultimately led to the Spanish
leaving their colony.
But at the same time,
there was the Spanish-American War
in 1898.
So instead of the Philippines
getting independence
like they were hoping for,
there was instead
just a transfer of colonial power.
So instead of being a Spanish colony,
all of a sudden
the Philippines was an American colony
out of the blue.
And of course
the people didn't like that.
And there was another war
that broke out between the Filipinos
looking for independence
and the Americans.
And like hundreds of thousands of people
died in that war.
And the Americans
were here for a while after that.
But you know
what's interesting is that
how much of an influence that period
of American rule
over the Philippines
has over the Philippines
now.
You can see a lot of American culture
when you just walk the streets
from the way people dress
and kind of music they listen to.
And more than
eight in ten Filipinos
today actually have
a positive view of the U.S.?
Partially, it's
because of the recent political alignment
between the Philippines and the U.S.
The Philippine and the U.S.
are on the same side
against China on claiming
who gets to control
how much of the sea
that is to the west of the Philippines.
But it's a lot more than that.
Like American culture
is a big part of Filipino culture
as much as Filipino
culture is a big part of
American culture.
There's like
4 million people of Filipino descent,
like Filipino Americans
living in the U.S.
and out of them, 1.6
million of them were in California,
and a lot of them were in L.A.
where I used to live.
So I knew like tons of Filipino Americans.
Something really funny is that,
like the most common
guests, I would get in L.A.
from random people
when they're trying to figure out, like,
what's my ethnic descent?
People would often
guess that I am Filipino American
because it was so common
to find Filipino Americans in California.
It's not just Filipinos
living in America, it's also Americans
living in the Philippines.
I think there's more than 300,000
American citizens
who reside in the Philippines right now.
So the cultures are very connected.
Something very interesting
that I've noticed
is you can find
just about every American fast food chain
in the Philippines,
like I've seen a KFC, Pizza Hut,
McDonalds,
Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy's.
I've never seen a Wendy's
outside the U.S.
before.
There's tons of places that offer
great fast food and great fried chicken.
But if you're thinking about great
fried chicken in the Philippines,
the place
you're probably going to
think about is Jollibee.
So I'm going to go
try out some Jollibee fried chicken now.
Interesting little market over here.
How are you?
- Sir!
-Where you from?
Bangladesh. Bangladesh.
-Are you Filipino?
No I’m Bangladeshi
-Filipino citizen?
No, no I’m Bangladeshi. I’m a tourist
-Bangadesh blog
I’m gonna try Jollibee.
I think it's good fried chicken.
-It’s good fried chicken
Thank you.
There's like all kinds of items
involving fried chicken here.
I think I’ll get a chicken sandwich.
Hi, can I get a chicken sandwich?
-Chicken sandwich?
Yes
-For dine in?
For dine in yeah
-For 7 minutes
I'm sorry?
-For 7 minutes 
7 minutes. Okay okay
-Welcome to Quiapo. The best area
Salmat
-Where are you from?
Bangladesh. -Bangladesh? 
Yeah.
So far far away?
Yeah. Yeah.
This is my second day in the Philippines.
I just got here 
- You take care of your things
Yeah,
-Because this area is so crazy
Everyone is telling me
I was in Divisoria
-Are you a vlogger?
Yeah. 
-Oh hiiiiii
People are so friendly
Can I pay with card? Is it cash only?
- Sorry cash pay system
Cash? Okay.
How much is it?
-244 pesos
- Any additionals? 
Now, I'm not that hungry right
now, so I think this will be it.
I don't think I have to say anything else
about how friendly
people in the Philippines are.
I think you saw it for yourself.
This kid is fascinated by my camera.
He started to touch it earlier,
but his mom
removed him.
Time
for the moment of the truth.
So here we have
Jollibee Crispy chicken sandwich
and some fries. I love fries.
So nice.
This is amazing.
It's still really hot.
That was a very, very
filling meal.
So let's go
back and talk about the history
a little bit.
Americans were basically here
till World War Two,
and then during World
War Two,
the Japanese invaded
and occupied this place
for like a couple of years.
And during that time,
this place saw a lot of bloodshed.
There was something called
the Manila massacre
between February
and March 1945,
where hundres of thousands of people were killed
during the war, and countless
people were raped
by the Japanese invading army.
And this city really took a hit.
All of intramuros
that we saw earlier was destroyed.
Manila was one of the most
destroyed cities in the whole world,
and it was pretty tragic.
The sound of bombs,
the people got used to it.
But finally, in 1946,
the Philippines became
an independent country
for the first time
after more than 300 years
and being ruled
by three colonial empires
in a sense.
They were free to be their own people.
So right in Quiapo is also this
small area
that is Muslim majority and I think it’s called
like Muslim town or something.
And when you’re entering
the gates of this area
you sort of
see a Ramadan mubarak sign on top
because the month of Ramadan
is starting very soon.
So although Catholics are like
80% of the country,
there's still like a
notable Muslim minority
and they make up about like
5% of the entire population.
Most of them live in the South though
So right in the middle of this Muslim area
is the Golden Mosque,
which is famous for its like huge
golden dome
and is the largest mosque
in all of Manila metro,
which can hold up to 22,000 people
from what I remember.
And even when you come into this area,
you start to see
the differences in people.
You see a lot of men in prayer attire,
you see a lot of women
wearing hijabs and all
There’s also this market here
where they're selling
all kinds of meat and fish.
You know what's fascinating
about the Philippines is the culture.
And it's such a melting
pot of different cultures,
partially because it was colonized
by so many different empires
from different parts of the world,
but also because it's in the middle
of all these other places
and has always been a trading hub.
It's such an interesting mix of culture.
First of all,
there's like a local Filipino customs
that have been there
for thousands of years.
Then there is the Chinese influence
of the Chinese immigrants
that have come over for hundreds
and hundreds of years.
So you see Hispanic religiosity
and romance and machismo,
but you also see the American influence
on clothing and pop culture
and Western ideals.
And, you know, interestingly,
this whole area, Metro Manila, is
one of the wealthiest regions
in all of Southeast Asia.
So while this is a part of Metro Manila,
they're also places that look like this.
So in the next video,
we're going to approach
Manila from a different part of town
and learn more about the city
and its different parts.
