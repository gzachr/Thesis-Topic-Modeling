in this noodle series i have to show
pansit which are filipino noodles that
so many people love and rave about
the way i make it is not traditional but
when i served it during our family party
during 4th of july
my dad told me it was probably the best
bunsen he's tried
to be honest making fun sit is pretty
easy my recipe just requires a lot of
ingredients because i like to have a
bunch of veggies and meat in the pan set
so that i can serve it as a meal
in itself you could simplify it by not
adding as many vegetables and meat
if it's your first time making it i like
to make panset with a little more liquid
than traditional pancetta so it's more
flavorful and doesn't end up feeling dry
i also put lemon or caramel see straight
into the bun set because i realized that
when i've given bunset to my friends or
co-workers in the past
they don't know that they should add the
citrus into the panset so i just do it
for them
do you have any other noodle ideas i can
try
