I'm so excited to try it all and I think
we've never tried majority of it as well
okay so we
so we are condo and
there's nothing else to say we just need
something you just need to dig in to be
honest let's start we're going to start
off with Roti John that's what I love
about Malaysians you know because
they're they're very friendly yes
they're all asking like where we're from
and they were so good at like helping us
yes what to pick as well let's start
this one so a lot of the locals were
saying that they only sell some of the
things to Ramadan so that kind of makes
it feel like a really good cultural
experience and we've never experienced a
Ramadan before this is actually our
first time trying Rottie John this type
of bread and omelette some chicken
lettuce some spring onions and lots of
sauce a lot a lot of sauce I've noticed
that in Malaysia they love sauce like
you're a saucy Saucy Nation
um how is it
not nice sweet chili sauce it's not too
spicy as well
and the bread
the bread is just so soft this is nice
it's really nice
it was a big mouthful it was delicious
honestly I wasn't expecting to um like
that as much as I do because I thought
it'd just be kind of like a sandwich but
it's really flavorful it doesn't feel
like bread I know it is bread it looks
like bread but I'm not getting bread
Vibes I mean we've got lots more we've
got lots more to try can we try this
because it's right in front of me I've
been eyeing this up since we left so
this is a vegetable spring roll we've
had vegetable spring rolls before but
let's see how this is cheers
good crunch oh
wow it tastes different not really at
all I like not only there's I thought
there's going to be greens I'm not sure
what kind of vegetable this is right so
uh maybe it's cabbage leave a comment
Down Below guys what this is
um because it's a hard workout do you
try the sauce as well it's really good
hey there's loads it's not that spicy
I don't know yeah
um it's a bit hot I thought all spring
rolls would taste the same but actually
that's got a different taste to it I
mean I love that I'm not sure what this
one is potato
oh yes sir Samosa it's like it looks
like
that's so true okay let's go
oh my God
that's my favorite so far wow
it's got like some kind of flavoring
around the potato
mmm that's so nice we should have got
more of this
coated in some kind of
um it was really good I might just go
back tomorrow
[Music]
like the combination of things I'm
tasting right now is just incredible
have you eaten the whole thing already
yeah well done I'm telling you I'm
hungry
should we go to the vein yeah
yeah all right so now my favorite part
we actually had one on the plane last
night it was quite funny the packaging
said best last evening
I highly doubt that the airplane one is
the best one but hopefully this is gonna
be better
so if you don't know what national map
is it's basically um the Malaysian
national food
and it is coconut rice
piece of meat you can either be chicken
or beef you've got your and anchovies
anchovies nuts nuts and what's this um
cucumber cucumber eggs and what's this
fish it's actually come on a banana leaf
and they were so good because everyone
was kind of serving themselves but we
didn't really know about how it was
meant to how it's meant to work and they
were so nice they just did it for us and
they were like explaining everything so
it's so good and I got this big piece of
chicken here look how big that chicken
is what's so nice about Nasi Lemak as
well is I'm not sure what it is but it
has this kind of like really crispy
almost hairy coating but it's like
almost like flakes of something
um
chicken is amazing
it's so flavorful
oh my word that's really good that's
better than the other two we've had best
Nasi Lemak I've had so far
the rice is amazing as well so good
there's so many different flavors I can
taste coconut I can taste lemongrass I
can taste
like
all these different spices and herbs on
the chicken really juicy these sort of
flavors I've never just a lot of flavors
just going on but
they're the sort of flavors I'm just
I've never really had that often and the
rice is just insane not too spicy either
yeah the one that they um on the plane
yesterday so he was like so spicy it's
so spicy
give the video a like if you're getting
hungry watching us eat do you want some
nasty lamac you know the food is good
if I'm not talking that much
yum
can't stop the rice is just so nice
any locals want to tell us kind of like
how you do Ramadan uh give us a little
bit more information because we've done
a little bit of research on Google but
it basically just tells you the very
simple facts I'm enjoying it though I
like trying all these different things
and everything was pretty good price as
well I think oh it's the best part it's
time for some sweet sweet desserts so
since we already tried this
time we should try it first so we didn't
mean to try it the guy was like please
try it try it so he tried it
honestly
describe it it's like a bad name yes it
looks like a bird's nest
look at that it's like
what even is that
um
smells so good as well
ready
Cheers Cheers
wow that's so good and the texture is so
strange but I love it it's kind of so
crunchy but so it's so thin so subtle
and it just kind of
breaks in your mouth it's crumbly I
wonder what it is it's so cool
I don't even know the name to Google it
I wonder what flavor this is this is
pistachios it's pistachio I'm not really
keen on pistachio but let's see
um good
wow
no it's so crunchy I love this wow
I don't know why we haven't tried this
on our first time here last year I've
never seen it
is this only during Ramadan as well guys
I tried
it was amazing
um
yum it's one of my favorite desserts
ever so you can have it every day if you
want
once a day
pancake now we did actually
the last time we were here
but let's this one's different it's got
sweet corn in it is that on purpose or
did that just accidentally cut I'm not
sure get in here
cheers
that's so strange
it was nice dude
wait
yeah yeah there's a sweet corn in it
we got the um the Nutty filling you can
get chocolate
and get some as stuff
this is so strange I can't get over the
sweet corn
it's really sweet and then you've just
got this corn flavor but it's nice
the pancake's really good as well really
fluffy
all right so to finish it off we got
this one here I literally just saw it
and I was like
so cute it's kind of like a mousse it
looks like something that was like a
liquid that's now dried um said it was
coconut and
oh like a spoon so it's like a mousse it
smells nice is it in a Banana Leaf I
can't remember what it's called oh this
is like nothing we've ever had before
is it good that's so good
oh that's good that is nice it's not too
sweet as well it's just perfect it's not
rich yeah I can't believe there's not a
single thing that I haven't thoroughly
enjoyed like every single thing we've
tried has been like 10 out of 10 good
like there's not been anything it's just
been like oh it's okay
that's all been really good Malaysia
just seems like a Foodies Paradise
honestly the flavors are just incredible
finish mine already anyway we've had
such a good time today I really enjoyed
interacting with the locals I just found
it so wholesome that that first the
first three they really they're so
Lively as well they're so nice and they
were really interested in like Czar and
then Zar was obviously interested in him
because at first I couldn't tell if he
was joking or not because like they were
all just shouting out they were like
telling us to go around the store and
then they're gonna show us how they how
to cook the Roti John yeah they put
inside it oh we forgot the drink and oh
yes
but we're gonna hold it there because we
actually forgot to
show you the Thai tea that we got so you
can actually get this for just five ring
it if you get it in a cup but because
we're taking it away we thought it'd be
better to get it in the bottle so this
was actually tendering it so a little
bit more pricey I would drink out of
this we're in a glass might as well
couldn't get from there I don't know
what makes it orange me and Zoe were not
we're not a big fan of tea despite the
fact We're British we are actually we
don't drink tea very often
but I can appreciate tea though it
smells like chocolate does it
oh that is nice is it sweet
um
is it sugary
it's a very small hint of tea yes it's
very milky but I like that I like that
it's like a subtle tea because like I
said we're not big tea drinkers I find
it a bit too strong but this that is
nice
a very wheat chocolate no it tastes like
tea
I drink that like that's nice but anyway
