[Music] hey friends Mike and Jess here and welcome 
to Regeneration Nation TV today we are doing  
something a little different we are reacting 
to Filipino drinking etiquette I think this is  
very exciting we're trying to do some different 
content dabble in a little bit of stuff but also  
learn about the cultures of the music that we've 
been reaction reacting to that's very interesting  
to us like exactly personally I'm a bartender 
so I'm very excited about this just because it  
kind of relates to my other job this came across 
my recommended feed because excuse me I've been  
you know I've been wanting to dive more into the 
cultures that we're reacting to learn more about  
it so when I saw this one I was like dude this 
would be so perfect to react to with you being  
a bartender Jess like knows so much about I 
get I don't want to be wrong when I say this  
but you know so much about alcohol [Laughter] so I 
guess you could say I know about American drinking  
etiquette if we have drinking etiquette I don't 
know but I just figured that this would be a  
very interesting and fun video to react to I'm 
excited I can't wait to see you I'm very excited  
as well we're getting away from a music reactions 
a little bit but if you do like this video leave  
some recommendations for more stuff like this yes 
we've thought about diving into different things  
other than just music reactions but keeping it in 
like immersing ourselves in different cultures yes  
um I love to cook so something else I've thought 
about is you know getting recipes from you guys  
and and trying to cook them you know making a 
video out of us trying to cook meals and and  
tasting it for the first time as well and uh so 
yeah if you have any other recipes some recipes  
you want to throw at us yes please because he 
likes to cook and I like to eat and it's a match  
made in heaven and I feel like the video would 
be amazing but anything else as well so uh yeah  
I'm excited for this I'm excited for this let's 
get into it let's do it communal drinking is a  
vital part of Filipino culture from the smallest 
birthday parties to Big Town fiestas Filipinos  
just can't seem to get together without having a 
few drinks on the table however believe it or not  
amidst the chaos lies and age-old Order welcome 
to Philippines 101 and this is Philippine drinking  
etiquette [Music] okay this guy sounds Australian 
and I'm not Australian in the Philippines aren't  
that far from each other yeah um I'm wondering 
about his ethnicity and how he you know thought  
about doing this video yeah I'm interested in that 
maybe it's a character his face though and he yeah  
he's okay yeah that makes sense he is playing a 
character it seems like as well yeah pain drinking  
etiquette I love it following the opening 
of the bottle the tangaro also called the  
Gunner and one of the into the characters of the 
drinking culture in the Philippines assumes an  
important role now prior to the commencement 
of the festivities a small portion of the  
intoxicating liquid is poured into the cap 
then subsequently emptied onto the ground this  
ceremonial offering to the spirits is considered 
essential for a safe and devil-free session
for the homies yeah you're right
considered essential for a safe and devil-free 
session the tanguero pours the drink every time  
measuring the liquor okay so the tinguero is like 
the bartender basically and yeah you know I don't  
know yeah interesting the participants are not 
given individual glasses this is in accordance  
with the tradition of bagay which means a show 
of trust camaraderie and in these days a United  
willingness to enter in a coveted Russian Roulette 
common glass passed in a round robin sequence dude  
could you imagine everyone at your bar sharing 
the same glass that I don't think that would  
happen but there are a lot of people that sit 
at the bar and they're like alcohol kills it  
alcohol will kill it so I feel like there's 
a lot of people that'll be like alcohol will  
kill it a covid Russian Roulette oh my gosh 
that's really cool I mean the parts that he  
was talking about before that the camaraderie 
the trust yeah I like the idea of that the
we've done that I mean I remember when I first 
started drinking this is gonna get too deep  
into it but we would literally open a bottle 
and literally pass it around like it's awful  
horrible you do crazy things when you're young 
and silly but that's absolutely right after like  
not even care if you're not your willingness to 
enter in a coveted Russian Roulette as drinkers  
share a common glass passed in a round robin 
sequence that's cool it is frowned upon to take  
a pass but when a drinker is excessively 
intoxicated a substitute from within the  
group must consume the short in the drinker's 
place without affecting his or her own turn  
to maintain okay so it doesn't affect their 
own turn so they have to take their friends  
and someone else's you gotta take what that's 
the definition of taking one for the team man  
somebody's got to do it it's a hard job serious 
without affecting his or her own turn sequence  
it is customary post an assumption to return the 
shot glass to the center of the table will hand  
it directly to that tangero to be refilled for the 
next Drinker what it's chicken oil yeah please let  
us know in the comments I've never seen a packet 
of chicken oil like that I've heard of chicken  
being cooked in oil but not chicken oil hmm oh 
my gosh the composition of every drinking session  
varies however it is important to familiarize 
oneself with these characters has to be aware  
of their characteristics the Drunken Master a 
legend gifted with immunity from inebriation  
usually left with the task of cleaning up 
after all is said and done The Walking Dead  
these creature's will to stay conscious despite 
consuming overwhelming amount of alcohol is  
commendable and allows it to continuously 
engage with the group I'll be it for me
sudden disappearances it leaves unnoticed 
bringing with it its share of the bills
the usual catalysts of trouble it turns 
aggro and overconfident with every shot  
but that might be my mom
sorry Mom this is so she's the werewolf it's 
literally breaking down every single Patron  
that I've seen at the bar they have a name dude 
you shouldn't send this to your other bartender  
you can start oh we got a werewolf over here 
we got a werewolf oh my God it turns aggro  
and overconfident with every shot the concert 
queen or King oh my a frustrated vocalist this  
creature bogarty karaoke machine in its quest for 
validation you're sleeping okay someone said that  
Roland abante they like them uh they prefer him 
when he's drinking and does karaoke I'm not sure  
we haven't got to that reaction yet I'm not sure 
if there's a video of him out there drinking while  
doing karaoke or something but I did see that 
comment I thought it was funny and now this makes  
me think of him he's the concert King oh I want 
to see that he doesn't need recognition though he  
doesn't need uh validation a frustrated vocalist 
this creature bogarty karaoke machine in its quest  
for validation the Sleeping Beauty with its loan 
tolerance for alcohol this creature lacks the  
ability to stay conscious with its introduction 
in its bloodstream because it is immobilized  
early on in the session the Sleeping Beauty 
is the primary target for embarrassing photo
I'm such a lightweight and when we start I haven't 
I don't really drink that often but man when we  
first started dating I did get my face doodled 
a few times you did that's so crazy you helped I  
did help I'm sorry I didn't just doodled myself 
put makeup on him that's what it was I'm so bad  
but I mean I guess I deserve it for being a 
Sleeping Beauty you're the first one to fall  
asleep I'm the primary target [Laughter] primary 
target for embarrassing photos and unwarranted  
pictures of it too the runner the one task 
with the acquisition and Logistics of essential  
supplies to perpetuate the drinking session such 
as ice and booze one privilege of the runner is  
that it is able to choose the food it likes to 
be consumed by the group along with the alcohol  
you see for Filipinos no drinking session is 
complete without the accompaniment of food  
yeah usually use the greasy and fatty variety 
this is called and it comes from the filipino  
word meaning to pick up now it is acceptable for 
drinkers to grab small bites in between shorts  
what is that are those little like bits of rib 
or something uh it's some kind of meat but it  
looks delicious it looks so good even that little 
like bowl of something yeah that looks so good  
this is to remove the bitterness from the alcohol 
as well as prolonged intoxication as the food is  
hoped to slow down the alcohol from entering 
the bloodstream it is unacceptable however to  
consume the pollutant with rice as it is meant to 
be shared and not to be hoarded and treated like  
a meal in the event that's interesting all right 
all right I'm loving this dude this is very cool  
you can't have your own little plate you gotta 
just pick it up and eat it and share it with the  
rest okay I like that I like that I do like it 
and not to be hoarded and treated like a meal  
in the event that grease or fat is unavailable 
inexpensive nuts and chips are usually the viable  
Alternatives including some Boon out of creative 
Ingenuity like the tuna and Kanto crackers
okay what that's the fancy stuff right there
he literally put some elbow 
grease into it literally
you can't tell me that you haven't had 
friends over and you're like I don't have  
anything in my fridge and you just whipped 
something else you literally just come up  
with something yeah I've done that a couple 
times I'm judging too harshly you're right
though like you're when you're young I 
feel like when you're younger you don't  
care as much and like you you just get away 
with it and your friends are like wow this  
is awesome it's just because I don't drink as 
much anymore if I was drinking even at my age  
now and there was nothing else to eat I'd be 
elbow chopping some crackers you get creative  
something you would you do think of it you 
just get creative this is hilarious I've seen
foreign [Laughter]
cheese the clinking of glasses and 
the partaking of a shared beverage  
containing every participant's DNA 
is meant to honor old friendships  
celebrate new ones and in certain 
situations possibly avert oneself  
from being violated with a sharp piece 
of metal designed to break up ice [Music]
[Music]
that was so good that was so funny
that was an awesome video that was very very 
fun and entertaining and educational as well  
yeah definitely I always every time we learn 
a little bit more about a culture uh it's like  
I want to adopt some of those things into my 
own life yeah and that is definitely that had  
a lot of those things well you already have 
the butt crack going for you so there's that  
hey they didn't need to know that they 
didn't they did not need to know that  
I don't need to know it either other people gotta 
share it with me sorry I already get enough crap  
from our sons for my crack showing sometimes 
okay I didn't need you getting in that was  
very entertaining and I couldn't believe like I 
love when you see different uh cultures like have  
we have similarities we do have similarities 
like when we get together we have a party we  
don't necessarily drink out of the same cup I 
mean depending on how much you drink at one of  
them sometimes you definitely do sometimes you 
just don't you just but it's not a it's not a  
necessity you know yeah if it was that would be I 
would not mind that sitting around a wooden table  
seems very familiar to me yeah just having a good 
time with friends and having like this communal  
time yeah just sounds so much cooler like you're 
not doing your own thing I would have a harder  
time with it because it's it's against tradition 
to turn down the drink and I'm like I I baby my  
drinks I get made fun of for it so much I baby 
my freaking drinks and I disappear here and I  
will pour one out sometimes and I'll come back 
like yeah I'm done I drink it how where's y'all's  
at I drank all of it I couldn't get away with 
that stuff here okay that's not good yeah you'd  
be right there all eyes on you you can't yeah 
Sleeping Beauty oh my goodness and like certain  
friend groups you get here it's definitely if you 
fall asleep first or if you pass out you're going  
to get messed with yep you're the one with the 
facial Doodles for sure yep but some friends are  
not like that but to know that it's like a common 
thing it's just like man I'm it makes me stressed  
out I can't go to the Philippines and drink with 
y'all man I would be in trouble yeah you would be
I wonder when I would be able to go back in 
there and look at my drinking style I'll have  
to go check it out I feel like you're the first 
one the very first one the uh the Drunken Master  
the Drunken Master yeah right you can hold your 
alcohol okay I probably would be in charge of  
the cleanup later though because I probably 
would be exactly you're all responsible and  
stuff even when you're drinking it's crazy 
let's clean it up let's get it get it the  
best that's hilarious that was so freaking that 
was fun I look forward to more videos I hope uh  
people have some uh links in the comments below 
because uh that was really fun hopefully this  
spurred an idea in you of something to send us 
yeah if you've seen anything like this even if  
uh you're not one of our Philippine friends 
right now and you're watching this something  
from your culture as well we're interested in 
diving into every culture yeah definitely no  
limit to other cultures yeah and yeah about the 
food thing don't forget send me some recipes you  
got to tell me what to buy so I can trying to 
whip these creations up I can eat it I want to  
eat it I really want to know what they were 
eating we need some communal eating around
