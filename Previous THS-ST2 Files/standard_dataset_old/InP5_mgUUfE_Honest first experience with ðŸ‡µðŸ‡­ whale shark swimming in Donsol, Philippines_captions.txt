we're the Lockwoods and we're traveling the 
world to experience up close and in person  
all the natural wonders and distinct cultures that 
our kids would otherwise be consuming only through  
textbooks and TV we've left the hustle and bustle 
of BGC Manila and flown down to the beach city of  
Donsol where we're hoping to catch a glimpse 
of the glowing trees of fireflies and cash in a  
rain check for swimming with the Majestic whale 
sharks of the Philippines but speaking of rain  
we've had constant showers since stepping off 
the plane last night so we're hoping to attract  
a little luck this morning while we wait for 
our guide let's get to it welcome to Alicia  
Beach Resort in Donsol it's been an hour and a 
half drive to get to our Resort from the airport  
last night waking up here and seeing it in light 
is refreshing because when we came to check in  
it's just this dirt road there's nothing paved 
here so the sidewalks for the resort are just  
stones and our huts are pretty basic which is 
very typical for the hotels in this area there  
all boutique hotels with maybe about 20 rooms but 
we have this big pool right in front of the beach  
and all of the rooms are basically beachfront 
because it's just this little u-shape all of the  
rooms are the same and none of them are connecting 
so we had to get two rooms and we are dividing and  
conquering a girl's room and boys room but they 
really do a good job keeping everything very clean  
we haven't seen any bugs in our room and also 
sadly Colt hasn't seen any geckos in his room  
no actually of course he found a gecko they have 
a restaurant on property so that's where you can  
get breakfast lunch and dinner and you can pay 
your bill at the end or with each meal service  
one really important thing to know about this 
Resort and all the resorts in this area they are  
cash only so bring a lot of pesos now let's talk 
Wi-Fi they have Wi-Fi in the restaurant only but  
since our rooms are really close to the restaurant 
we've been kind of Lucky and we get a little bit  
of it otherwise we're working on cellular but 
this is a very affordable area to stay in our  
rooms are about 75 dollars per room per night 
so for our time here we're paying a total for  
two nights and two bedrooms about 350 US Dollars 
it's time for the whale sharks we're gonna meet  
our guide and we have to take this trike to 
get there all four of us are gonna fit in it
okay it was a very short ride it probably took 
about a minute and a half good morning so we  
start off with an orientation in here to learn a 
little bit more about what to expect time to get  
educated now out of all the phenomenal things 
you can do Aaron and I didn't bring our fins  
because they're awkward to pack and travel with 
for just one little Excursion so we are renting  
some fins here for a few bucks we already have 
our masks and snorkels the kids have their full  
snorkel set so they're all set you have to find 
the right fit oh look at this guy's helping us out  
thank you we should point out that there is 
statistically speaking a better chance that we  
won't see whale sharks today than that we will 
and that's because of the way they handle the  
interactions here in Donsol versus other places 
throughout the Philippines and throughout the  
world they do it very ethically they're not going 
to Chum the water to attract the whale sharks so  
that means there is a pretty decent chance we'll 
come up empty-handed but it's really all about the  
experience so we'll see if we get lucky today 
I don't know but that is specifically why we  
chose Donsol for our whale shark experience we 
wanted the most natural the most eco-friendly  
it's a risk but we're doing it because this is 
the kind of experience we want and if you want  
that experience too that's why we're showing you 
we're with Janelle he's gonna be our guide the  
rest of the way and in the water with the whale 
sharks hopefully but we're headed to our boat  
over here really wish us luck press that like 
button help us out with some good energy in the  
air and hopefully we can see some of these sharks 
these whale sharks they are this we're gonna be  
circling this area and we have three hours so if 
we don't see any whale sharks within those three  
hours no luck we're just going home without it but 
until then we are just waiting and circling so if  
you've been following our Channel some of you may 
know that when we were in Cebu last fall we had  
one of these excursions planned for the south of 
Cebu we ended up canceling that and instead opted  
to do the street food tour in Cebu City if you 
haven't seen that episode you can click up here  
to add it to your queue besides the fact that 
it was about a four hour drive from Cebu City  
where we were staying at our Resort down to where 
that was and it seemed like a really really long  
day we also decided that the information that we 
had heard about Donsol and the way that they  
interact with the whale sharks here was preferable 
to the experience that we would have had in Cebu  
it's almost guaranteed that you're gonna see 
a whale shark when you're in Cebu they throw  
Chum into the water to attract the whale shark so 
if that's what you're into it's the Boo and oslob  
is the place for you but for us we are risking 
it and that's okay with us because again like  
I said we're looking for the more natural 
experience for our family and at the end of the  
day worst case scenario is we have a three hour 
tour on a boat which we've paid over a thousand  
dollars to do before in various parts of the world 
yeah it's raining a little bit here and that takes  
away from a little bit of the enjoyment maybe but 
it's still beautiful water in a beautiful place  
so life could be a whole lot worse if you're 
wondering where the kids are they are down  
below here eating some snacks might as well eat 
some snacks while you're waiting for whale shark  
hopefully our luck is turning already the weather 
is clearing up a bit it's much nicer out now  
and we've got a guy Up on the Roof looking for 
whale sharks for us he'll be the first to spot  
them this is such a good lesson and perseverance 
or a grit because it's here with all of the rain  
it's it's coming in again the little chunk of 
blue sky that we had there for a few minutes  
is gone it's now grayer and Rainier than ever 
and it's just coming in sideways it's cold the  
kids are in there it'd be so easy to just say I 
don't think we're gonna see anything today let's  
turn the boat around head back and do something a 
little more fun playing the pool or something but  
always that chance so we're gonna stick to this 
even if it takes us three hours of standing in  
the rain and it's a little chilly this is not 
what we expected when we first signed up but  
it is what we expected as we got closer to the day 
knowing that the weather wasn't going to cooperate
it's pretty much rounded up and we're coming up 
empty-handed unfortunately very unusual for our  
experiences we almost always luck out that's 
just the way the cookie crumbles sometimes so  
we're gonna get back in here probably get dried 
off and do a little local experience of some sort  
and get ready for our nighttime Firefly river 
tour on the plus side they are delivering us  
right to our Resort because we're right on the 
water and I guess we're just gonna get as close  
as we can we might need to get a little bit wet 
Colt fell asleep on some fishnets so come here  
buddy you can just head right on up there honey 
thank you it feels really nice out now it's not  
even raining here yeah but that's you know when 
it comes to Nature it's always unpredictable and  
that's what we love about it it's always changing 
you know Nature's a fan of our Channel always be  
changing one of the great things about where 
we're staying is that each of the room units  
has its own bathroom and that is not always 
the case for some of the hotels or Resorts  
that they have along this strip also they have hot 
showers it felt so good get warmed up and we were  
thinking about having lunch a couple doors down at 
Barracuda but since it is raining on and off we're  
just gonna stay here and have lunch at Alicia 
now it's raining so much you would think that  
it's the rainy season but it's not this is unusual 
weather for this time of year beautiful Alfresco  
seating by the water and I got be cool Express 
which is a local dish and it is meat green beans  
and some peppers that is delicious and very spicy 
the meat's really tender but the sauce it's cooked  
in is so delicious it's like a coconut sauce 
with a beef broth kind of a taste it's really  
yummy and I got some chicken curry I'm starving 
and it looks fantastic big potatoes in here I'm  
almost as excited about these as I'm about the 
chicken that's really good curry oh so these are  
um not like little chunks of chicken that you 
would just eat out right there actually still  
bone in so I have a little bit of work to do 
with mine but it'll be worth it because this is  
really really good I'm very impressed for such a 
small town and a small restaurant this is part of  
a tiny little Resort this food is so authentic 
and delicious now we're off to town we have to  
hit an ATM because we need more pesos we have 
to check out tomorrow and then we're doing our  
Firefly Tour on the river that is 100 guaranteed 
we're not worried about that not happening today
we're going to explore the downtown donsil area 
a little bit here this totally reminds me of our  
street food tour when we were with June in Cebu 
City walking around this is definitely a local  
hangout maybe we'll even find some balut in here 
I don't know but we're kind of exploring an indoor  
market right now it's starting to rain outside and 
can we just say again how crazy it is that it's  
raining as if it's the wet season even though 
it's not the wet season but it's just raining  
off and on and off and on I think that a lot of 
the dollars that come into the city are from the  
whale shark swimming until 1998 that wasn't even a 
thing it was just a sleepy little seaside village  
but scuba divers discovered the whale sharks here 
in 1998. now it really reminds me of a loot if we  
were here longer we'd probably do another food 
tour but we only have about 15 minutes I have to  
say I want to point out how awesome my hair is in 
the humidity that is the best part about humidity  
we are off to the fireflies okay we are here and 
it sure got dark on the drive over I'm excited  
about this I think it's going to be beautiful I'm 
glad that this is guaranteed it's so Charming the  
people here in donsil are so kind they are 
so nice I love this community and I I feel  
really bad that the whale sharks weren't there 
today uh because I really want to sell you on  
this community and help their economy and and come 
here so I know they're going to be there for you  
this rain just won't give us a break it 
is just as soon as we got in the boat it  
started down pouring and I think we might 
be having a little trouble with the boat  
literally said that the 
fireflies were guarantee [Music]
it's less than that nothing is guaranteed 
but take it in stride and laugh it off
okay three go
we're clapping because the fireflies will 
respond to the Noise by lighting up more
there they did it they twinkled up a bit more 
it's really pretty to see the fireflies in the  
trees and then go right into the sky the stars are 
out already it's a beautiful night who'da thought  
after that downpour we just had this guy is clear 
and we can see the stars so Ryan's built right  
there there are over 2 000 species of fireflies 
in the world only one here in donzo and it's the  
smallest species it's about a half a centimeter 
long it's about half the size of the fireflies  
where I grew up in Indiana in the USA these are 
also very small like golden color as opposed to  
the the black ones that we had when I was a kid 
we're getting a little quiz we're supposed to  
guess how can you tell if it's a male or female 
my guess was that maybe the lights in the front  
for a boy and in the back for a girl and Phil and 
Brooklyn say that the male's light is brighter  
that's a pretty good guess Colt what's your guess 
I'm gonna think of the easiest explanation for  
this which is the females have a brighter light 
than the males we notice there are fireplaces keep  
on flying around the tree and there are fireplaced 
so just staying in the tree right so those  
fireflies that active in flying those are the male 
fireflies and the females are the one that is just  
staying in a tree and continuously blinking 
let's say that they are the lazy one female  
fireplace are lazy one even though from afar it 
looks like these are just all the same color of  
Lights there are four different shades or tints or 
tones there's yellow there's a pale red there's a  
bluish and there's a green and I can close up you 
can really see that but from far away you can't  
our new question is how many eggs do we think 
that each female Firefly can produce my guess  
is uh three a hundred or two hundred oh six to 
eight thousand each of the female Firefly they  
can produce an approximately 500 eggs and 
on the 20 can survive so almost a hundred  
Brooklyn got it right and during low tide is 
when the females go down and they lay their  
eggs in the mud they also kind of live together 
and cluster around the same tree like they have  
a home and they all stay around that area and the 
neighboring family will be next door and they kind  
of stay in their own territory but they might mix 
a little bit did I get that right they cannot mix  
at all they stay in their own territories 
so they have their own little homes and no  
mixing despite Mother Nature's Best attempt to 
keep us from all of our activities today uh we  
succeeded perseverance and grit and at the 
end of the day we got to see these beautiful  
fireflies it's a beautiful evening the night 
is still young we're not ready to call it quits  
we heard some good things about this Barracuda 
place down here restaurant bar just a couple  
of resorts down from our Alicia Resort so we're 
going to stop in here have a little dinner maybe  
a couple of cocktails the path to get here is 
super super muddy it's just off of the road and  
I think we've got to be close to the beach though 
it's not mud anymore it's sand now wow and lovely  
little porch seating and I know Phil's got his 
eye on this board over here with all the cocktails  
listed and Aaron's going to be very interested in 
the food menu with some really fresh Seafoods jack  
fish Barracuda of course Sashimi tuna calamari and 
they do pasta here so you can get a Bolognese or  
a pork in vermu what are you thinking baby oh 
I've got my eye on those prawns all right yeah  
I'm definitely diving into the margarita because 
Juliet said it was strong and that sounds good to  
me fresh squeeze juice and it is strong Juliet is 
a who this is her place and she is Filipino but  
she actually lived overseas for decades she was in 
Europe for 50 15 years doing Chef work the United  
States for 20 years I think she said her husband 
is German but she's a real character we're gonna  
have to eat fast monkeys are tired we are so close 
to the water it's pitch dark so we can't even see  
it but you can hear it and actually right up here 
at the very end you can see the little white caps  
as they break on the beach I think we're like 
10 feet from the shore it's gonna be beautiful  
during the daytime anytime you go to a new like 
Beach Town especially your friends tell you oh  
there's this one place that you have to go to and 
I really get the sense that here it's Barracuda  
and it's because of Juliet she's a fantastic Chef 
so if you come to Donut Soul definitely come by  
Barracuda I am such a happy camper these prawns 
are ridiculous they're ginormous they're like  
little lobsters they're so big I'm gonna be stuck 
by two prawns and Phil got the pork in vermouth  
and cream sauce this is delicious wow Juliet is 
the real deal and it's like the little places  
here nobody would know about unless you actually 
come here and stumbled upon it well we're telling  
you about it so when you come to donsil you got 
to get to Barracuda we're going to take our time  
oh the head fell off we're gonna take our time 
and really enjoy this dinner this is the best  
prawn I have ever tasted she put like a garlic rub 
on it it is the best flavor prawn I've ever had  
good night my favorite part of the locals here is 
probably Carmel she offered me her sweater and hat  
to stay warm gave us a bunch of snacks for the 
boats and lots of cuddles you know how much you  
love cuddles my favorite memory of the locals 
here was when I was trying to open up a coconut  
and they came running out with a butcher knife to 
help me I really enjoyed talking to Juliet last  
night learning about her her life in Europe and in 
the US and then here in the Philippines and she's  
had to struggle through so much earthquakes and 
tsunami and she really cares about this community  
and her food and it really shows in her food every 
tsunami do you mean by tsunami I meant typhoon I'd  
say my favorite memory is from walking downtown 
last night and just going past every little group  
of locals every little street food vendor every 
little retail establishment and getting really  
warm smiles from every single person you can tell 
that they're just very happy to have tourists here  
experiencing the local flavor and I think we all 
just nailed it like we can swim with whale sharks  
all around the world in the coming months but 
don't Seoul Hospitality that can only be found  
here it's family focused from our resort to the 
whale shark trip to the river tour these things  
were literally provided by passionate husbands 
and wives brothers and sisters working together  
to provide a welcoming experience for visitors 
who come in search of Adventure it's a testament  
to the Integrity of the donzo community the same 
compassion that we've experienced as guests is  
reflected in how they treat nature I mean this 
is a place that just 25 years ago had no real  
tourism industry and once they realized what 
they had they chose to build it out the right  
way to focus on responsible ethical conservation 
and that's the real natural resource of donsil  
not the wildlife but the people we may have come 
up empty-handed in the search for whale sharks  
on this particular visit but we're leaving with 
Full Hearts for the privilege of spending a few  
magical days with another community of inspiring 
Filipinos but now we have to say goodbye as we're  
off to chargao hit that subscribe button and 
come along with us for more Philippines Magic
we are the Lockwoods Erin Phil Reagan Brooklyn 
and Colt we're traveling the world to experience  
up close and in person all the natural 
wonders and distinct cultures that our  
kids would otherwise be consuming only through 
textbooks and TV we think it's a better way to  
learn and we're working hard to fund this 
little experiment in the hope that our kids  
will grow up wiser Kinder and more grateful for 
the beauty of our diverse planet and its people
