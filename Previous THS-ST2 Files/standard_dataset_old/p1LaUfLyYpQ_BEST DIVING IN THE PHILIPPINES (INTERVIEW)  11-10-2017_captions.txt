- [Brad] There he is.
- Finishing the gear.
- [Brad] He calls himself Napoleon.
(laughs)
He's the man that never gets lost
when he's diving, that's why.
How many dives have you got, 2,000, plus?
- Yes.
- [Brad] So this man
stopped logging his dives
at 2,000, back in 1994.
- Yes.
- [Brad] Then they call him Napoleon,
because after 2,000 dives you
can never get lost, right?
(laughs)
Alright, so we have Napoleon in the house,
the dive master here, in the Philippines.
Just quickly, the man
with 2,000 dives, plus.
Stopped logging his dives back in 1994
because he ran out of log books.
Where would you say is
the best place to dive
in the Philippines this time of the year?
We're in October.
Best place.
- I think Dumaguete, Apo Island.
- Numaguete?
- Apo Island.
- And what's it called?
- Apo Island.
- Apo Island.
- Yes, and Malapascua and Bohol.
- You have to write all that down for me.
- Yes, and Malapascua and Bohol, yes.
- Okay, Bohol.
- Yes, Bohol.
- What about Honda Bay?
- No, I don't think--
- He doesn't like Honda Bay, this man.
Google says Honda Bay's
good but if this man here
with 2,000, plus, dives says
it's shit, then don't go.
Where else, what about, so, El Nido?
El Nido?
- Yup.
Yeah, it's nice go El Nido.
- El Nido?
- Yup.
And of course, Tubbataha number one.
- Tubbataha?
- Tubbataha.
- Tubbataha,
- Yes.
- I'll write that--
- I will show you later
in the map.
- Okay, I'ma show you later on the map.
Tubbataha.
- Yes.
- Any other recommendations?
(laughs)
Any other dive site places
that people might need to know about
if they decide to come here?
Anywhere else that Google's
not going to tell them, but...
- Coron also is nice,
it's more on-reg diving.
- Ah yes, is that the World War II ship?
- Yes.
- World War II ship?
- World War II, yes, World War II ship.
- And that's in Coron?
- Yes, Coron, north of Palawan.
- Okay, and is that worth doing?
- Yes.
- Yup?
Mosquitoes, man!
Mosquitoes everywhere,
- Yes, it's a lot of bugs.
- Alright, that's it.
we're off.
- (laughs) At this time.
- (laughs) Cool, ciao.
- Ciao!
- Ciao!
Hasta la vista, baby!
- Look at this guy, napoleon!
