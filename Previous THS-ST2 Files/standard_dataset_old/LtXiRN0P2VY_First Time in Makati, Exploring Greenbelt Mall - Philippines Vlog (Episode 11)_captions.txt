Hello guys! right now we are in Makati
in Manila, the capital of the Philippines
actually Makati is the financial center
of the philippines
many people they travel for business or
even for holidays they stay in Makati
that's why we chose to stay in Makati
but it is so close to Greenbelt
Greenbelt is one of the main attractions
in Makati and we are going to check it
It is near Christmas and there is a Christmas tree. if you haven't watched the previous videos
go and check it, we have been in different
part of Philippines and I think
Makati is totally different from any part of
the Philippines
It is modern with high buildings but the other cities like Coron or Cebu
we had different experience go and check it
We were diving and as you can see I am a
bit sick and I was suffering from flu
I got better but I still am not
hundred percent back
I want to use my time in Makati, so let's go
here there is no zebra crossing and we
were watching other people how they
cross and they just cross like this and we
should do the same
we found out that in Greenbelt there are 
various options of restaurants
You can find Filipino's food or even international food and I found a Persian restaurant
it is also  good for shopping
and the environment is really nice. It is so beautiful
and now we are out of Greenbelt and
apparently we are on a bridge we are
going to another mall
I like how they built this place
It is so cool and fun
though I think you're going to another mall
You know when you go a mall in the Philippines or any indoor public places like hotels you should pass through security gates
I think this is the case in all the Philippine
We also experienced this is Cebu
we were walking inside the Greenbelt and
actually  found the fun part of it
we are trying to play some games
these cows are so cool. actually the first
time I saw them I didn't realize that
they are just artificial and for your
safety don't climb them
I'm going to see if she is scared of
me or not
as I said there are many options here
to have food and even not just food, coffee or anything
since it is launch time and we are hungry we just chose randomly a restaurant to eat
it looks cute and they had pasta, Pizza, salad, seafood and a lot desserts. we ordered pasta
but this pasta  I never had it before it is made with Dory fish
I had pasta with Salmon but never had it with Dory
I am going to try it here
Bruno is lucky that he got his pasta which
is a smoked salmon pasta with the cream
I don't know why I didn't get my food I
think the guy brought the food gave my
foot to another table yeah
I got my food
I'm going to try and see how it
it's really good it's with saffron
it was worth waiting
Bruno! what did you order ?
Chocolate truffle cake with some vanilla ice cream
and a cappuccino and you're judging
I have a camera to eat
we actually went for Philippino dishes
