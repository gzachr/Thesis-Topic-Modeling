boracay island but we had a little bit of a rough  
morning so before we get into today's activities 
let me explain just how we ended up here this  
morning okay so this is the village that we stayed 
in for my birthday we just we didn't feel anything  
before we're just enjoying my birthday offline but 
we thought we'd show you just before we check out  
just briefly what it looked like and then we can 
get into the rest of the fun activities today on  
boracay but let's have a look real quick this is 
a bathroom bathroom bedroom this is the bedroom  
so you come down the stairs after the entryway 
and you have the big bed it's like a king bed  
it's super super comfortable so this is the 
bathroom it's really big and the shower is  
awesome it's like a whole room back there you have 
a really nice shower rainfall really cool love it  
big bathroom big bedroom all ticks for me let's go 
upstairs wait hold on i'll show you the fun part  
so this is your own private little balcony and 
then you have a massive plunger pool down there it  
went up to about my head and i'm about five foot 
five or something and then you have a really cool  
outdoor shower over this way as well okay cool 
let's go come on okay so then he comes through  
here through the front entrance up the stairs keep 
going up the stairs and it turns really hot about  
here because downstairs is air conditioning and 
upstairs even but you have a full dining table you  
have a kitchen over there you have a big lounge 
sits in faces the amazing view that's outside  
it is warm but there's fans at the top and 
fan over there as well they have all of their  
like plates pan stove forks fridge they have egg 
eggs you can make your own eggs fruit some fruit  
and then you have an awesome lounge with 
this amazing view oh look at the boat  
can you see it that's cool 
hammock to lay in suits to sit in  
amazing view and villa to be in so 
wait real quick look at the secrets
and i jumped in right from up here no you 
didn't that's dangerous don't do that so  
that's it for this villa we just enjoyed this 
one for my birthday but let's head on to the  
rest of the fun activities that we have we're 
actually on the way to check into our next place  
so let's do that and we'll show you the rest 
of the fun day that we have on boracay island
so this is going to be my first time in 
an e-try you could do it yeah we'll see
oh thank you oh thank you
thank you
so i think we just got a little scammed uh we 
ordered the we were on the tricycle thing and  
he just dropped us here but we have to go all the 
way down there by like a long way so i think he  
knew that and he just kind of dropped us here and 
we paid for it but you know what you live and you  
learn these things happen let's go for a long 
walk and i have no energy i need a coffee all  
right let's go i'm holding my shoes okay so it's 
not even in that street it's a bit further down so  
oh it's too early for this for 
me i haven't had a coffee yet
all right so we're maybe halfway sure we have 
to go all the way to the very end basically so  
maybe he couldn't have got the tricycle down here 
but we're just pulling all this stuff and yeah
oh thank you okay we are still  
still going i'm tired that's for sure i see the 
water now yay oh now it's sand this is harder
so we just maybe you're playing the sailboat now 
no thank you we're gonna have some food thank you  
thank you so we're just going to go grab some food 
we just checked in to the hotel it's just for one  
night and then we're leaving in the morning the 
um room will be ready for us in about 30 minutes  
so we're just gonna pop along the beach here 
find something i in case you can't tell have  
not that much energy today but that's okay we're 
gonna get into some fun activities this afternoon  
i'm gonna have some coffee i'm gonna 
have some monster i'm gonna wake up  
let's go get some food oh i need food we haven't 
even had food yet and then we're going to eat i  
don't know what i'm saying let's get some food 
this is beautiful that's what i'm saying look at  
this amazing so another thing i've learned about 
the philippines is that there's always a starbucks  
somewhere right on the beach i am not mad about 
that i do need a coffee um but we're still on  
the hunt for some breakfast because it's about 
midday we haven't had anything to eat yet today so  
okay so i think there's a fan here that you might 
hear in the video but it's so hot i need the fan  
um i just want to tell you why i'm really tired 
today so really quickly uh today last night i  
stayed up quite late because my first video in 
manila the first impressions one went up and uh  
so many of you liked it and subscribed that i 
hit 20k and so thank you so much but i was just  
i was so excited and so happy and like i just 
was too excited to sleep and i was like staying  
up i was like oh my gosh i'm so close i'm so 
close and yeah i hit it last night so that's  
why i'm a little bit tired it was on my birthday 
so what a good birthday present so thank you all  
for my birthday present of 20 000 subscribers 
thank you okay so that was actually a really nice  
coffee and i'm really happy about that because i 
needed it but before we go out and we do anything  
else i just want to show you this room so we've 
just checked into this one we're only here for  
one night as we're leaving to the next destination 
tomorrow but i just thought i'd show you the room  
so as you walk in you have this beautiful room 
here it's um pretty standard but actually quite  
nice to be honest you have the desk that 
we need to use because we both work online  
there's a desk over here but there's also a 
dining room chair and table over there as well  
big bed looks like a king to me not sure what 
it like feels like actually let's just try  
oh it's actually quite soft okay that's cool 
because i like soft beds and then it looks  
straight out onto this little balcony that 
you have with some chairs and it has really  
nice greenery over there as well and then if you 
come through here around this little room divider  
you have the bathroom but on this side you have 
the toilet on this side you have the shower room  
and then you have the sink right there so 
this is where we'll be staying for tonight  
breakfast in the morning and then we're flying to 
the next place but right now we're gonna go and  
get like an activity done everyone in the comments 
in my manila video was telling me to do some  
uh like water sports on boracay island so we're 
gonna do that today we just gotta pick which one  
what do we have they've given us this which ones 
are they helicopter tour of the island oh how  
much is that about 200 per person whoa i mean it's 
expensive but you're thinking what i'm thinking v1  
no i want to do something like like that i can 
do you know like a helicopter is just kind of  
sitting there i want to do something if you're 
new here i broke my back about four years ago  
so anything with like impact on the water like 
kind of really scares me so i might be looking  
at maybe like a stand-up paddleboarding or like 
a canoeing or like something like that that might  
that might be a little bit safer um for me to do 
but let's pick one of them and then we'll head  
out in a second and show you the beach because 
we have like full-on front beach access from  
this resort hotel so that's really cool oh and as 
always i'm gonna leave the hotels and the villas  
and everything in the description bar below so we 
paid well michael paid for this for my birthday  
but it's not a collaboration i'm just gonna leave 
them below if you want to stay where we stayed as  
well okay so i just went down and i spoke to 
reception and i'm gonna do the parasailing um  
so i've never done that before and we're gonna go 
out and parasail over the island boracay island so  
i'm so excited um it was 1900 pesos going through 
this uh hotel that we're staying in i'm not sure  
what the going rate is but i'm just happy to have 
it organized and done um but we're just heading  
down there now and this is gonna be fun all right 
let's go let's go downstairs okay so we've just  
walked up the like laneway to the main street so 
this is the main street um and i think they're  
just gonna collect us and take us to the boat or 
where we're gonna go up i'm not sure um but i do  
feel some rain so i'm getting a little bit nervous 
okay we're just crossing the road to head into the  
car or the truck or the bus that's going to 
take us to where we go up in the air thank you
hi so they've taken us to like the port or 
like the beach and then they've got a big  
line thing that goes out to sea there and i 
think they take us from here to on a boat a  
speed boat that takes us to like where we're 
getting on to parasail if that makes sense  
oh there's so many people out there i don't know 
if you can see that there's like seven people out  
in the air in the middle of the ocean okay this 
is where i tell you that i'm scared of the ocean
but what if i fall in i probably can't swim 
i'm scared so we're just heading out now  
on the uh boat and i think we're going 
to where then we'll go up in the thing
thank you thank you i got it i love something 
okay so we're on like a houseboat and obviously  
we go from this houseboat to this guy this 
guy okay i'm a little bit scared of the  
ocean in case you don't know so this will be 
oh look at everyone on the banana boat look
so
big booty
we saw something like jump out of the ocean
okay
okay go faster go faster i'm 
going down i'm going down

biggest fear is literally open water in the ocean  
like this oh my oh my gosh oh my gosh go higher 
please i was so close to the ocean then oh my oh
oh my gosh guys it's like i'm floating in the air  
but i'm so scared it's i can 
see like the whole sea below me  
oh it's kind of uncomfortable in my legs to 
be honest i'm holding on for literal dear life
i think i'm coming back in now i'm going down  
yeah oh my gosh guys that was so 
scary but that was so cool oh my gosh  
please don't let me hit the water don't let me hit 
the water it's like my biggest fear oh my gosh oh

oh thank you i think
i have sea legs
i said legs in the water and i went all 
right okay it's just started to rain here  
on boracay island it was coming through when i 
was in the water on the parasail but i haven't  
actually gone for a swim in the ocean yet and 
we're actually leaving tomorrow to go to another  
destination in the philippines so i have to 
go in the water i'm gonna have a quick dip  
stay in this beautiful water here for a little bit 
the water is beautiful it feels like quite warm  
with like a little tinge of cold but not really 
it's not enough to not want to go in or anything
around me
okay so we just got out of the 
water and we're just heading down  
this main sort of strip on the beach 
um because a few of you in my comments  
were telling me that i need to try is it jonas 
juice spa or something jonas is that right yep  
so we're going to try and head there and 
have a juice that you all recommended because  
apparently it's a must do when you're 
on boracay island so let's have a look
okay so we just ordered our drinks michael 
got chopped peanut butter and i got pineapple  
mango so delicious i'm really excited all right 
so that was a really cool shake i don't normally  
often have like fruit shakes and that one was 
really nice and right now it's like the sun has  
just sort of got down and there's still so 
many people on this beach on this island so  
we're just heading back now but there's a massive 
day here i love the vibes of boracay by the way  
everyone has so much fun all the time it's just 
easy going it's the best this is like one of  
this is such a good island to come to you should 
definitely come here people will ask you if you  
want to go on a boat sail ride every two meters 
but or whatever right but whatever yeah yeah  
it's cool it's fun so that's it from beautiful 
boracay island in the philippines what was your  
favorite part of the vlog let me know in the 
comments below because mine was probably the  
parasailing even though that was the scariest one
