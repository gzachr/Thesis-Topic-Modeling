Couples composed of younger Filipina females and older foreign males are not exactly new. Ever since the Spanish conquered the Philippines, there have been pairings of older white foreign males and younger filipinas. The older a man is, the more established he is financially and the more he can provide for his family. Most women, Filipinas and otherwise, aren't looking for men who act like babies.
