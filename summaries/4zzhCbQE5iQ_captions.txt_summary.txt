The Kitchen of Mama LuLu is a weekly, offbeat look at what's going on in the family kitchen. This week, LuLu shows you how to make vegetable lumpia. We love to mix mix our food. Just mix, mix. That's why halo halo is popular in the Philippines. We are going to wait for it to cool, then we can wrap the lumpia. Lumpia is easy to cook. About 3-5 minutes. You get one pack when you crave and fry it. You do not have to thaw or wait before cooking them. I really just guesstimate my ingredients. And it's our family recipe. The stuffing you did can also be made for fresh (no fry) lumpia version. Instead of vinegar, you use water and you boil them for a bit. The wrapper is the same, but with lettuce.
