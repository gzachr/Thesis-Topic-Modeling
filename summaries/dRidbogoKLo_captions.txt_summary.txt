Kare kare is a savory meat stew that consists of oxtail and vegetables all covered in a thick savory peanut sauce. To create the dish you'll want to start off with two and a half to three pounds of Oxtail. A plate of Kare Kare isn't complete without a side of bagoong. This is used as a dipping sauce that helps to balance out the savory flavors. Just make sure to use it sparingly with each bite.
