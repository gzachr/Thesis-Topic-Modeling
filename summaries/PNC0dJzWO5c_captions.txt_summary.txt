CNN's John Defterios and his crew are in Manila for their first full day in the Philippines. They are using Google Maps to try and get from Makati to intramuros. The traffic is so busy it's crazy but this is a huge City it's really creamy with the egg in the middle. The jeepney is the it's the most popular form of Transport in all of Manila and it's easy to see why because it's really really cheap. It took us three Japanese to get to intramural but the history of the jeepneys is really interesting. American GIS left the GP behind when they left the country and then local people started to convert the jeepney into a form of transport to take the local people around the city and it sits about 20 people so it is it is hot it is sweaty but it's cheap and I'll definitely be doing that again. Manila Cathedral is one of the most iconic landmarks in intramuros. Fort Santiago is a military Fortress that was built during the Spanish colonial era. San Agustin church was built in 1571 this Baroque style church is the oldest Stone Church in the Philippines. Rizzle Park offers a variety of attractions and activities for visitors to enjoy it features iconic landmarks such as the Rizzle Monument Chinese and Japanese Gardens and a man-made Lagoon. Rizzle Park is a must visit destination that showcases the Philippines Rich cultural heritage.
