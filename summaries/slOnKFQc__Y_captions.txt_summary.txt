This is an alternate version of one of the most popular activities here on the island of Coron. This is the crew's adventure update from Kayangan Lake Trail. Underwater rock climbing is the new extreme sport at Kayangan Lake, in Cangayan, Kayga. The extreme sport requires the participants to wear a life jacket. Luluyuwan is also known as Barracuda Lake, because there apparently are barracudas inside. At between 14 and 20 meters, there is a layer of 40 degrees Celsius hot salt water. The swirling of the two waters makes an iridescent foggy, shimmering layer. Exploring with Cody. That was a fantastic day exploring around Coron in the Philippines. We had an awesome day today, we saw some incredible things. If you haven't checked out Cody's channel, you've got to make sure to do that.
