The Lockwoods are traveling the world to experience up close and in person all the natural wonders and distinct cultures that our kids would otherwise be seen only in textbooks and TV. Their first of two flights is already delayed by an hour putting their connection in Manila at risk. Will we make it to the laid-back surf destination this afternoon or will we have to come up with an exciting Plan B? Aaron and the kids are in Manila for the night. They are staying at the Shangri-La brand. The kids have twin beds in their rooms. "We're not even sure where we're going to be able to get some cocktails we're just gonna go with the flow roll with punches" "I might do the Wednesday dance [Music] Talent right there" "We made it up here just in time for the fireworks and there's front of them going off" When the parents are happy right there's a happy family [Music] when you found out that you're gonna be traveling the way you're doing right now how did you feel I was excited beyond belief like I felt so antsy to get out of you know our whatever routine we were in that I couldn't wait to go and do something different and get out out of our comfort zone. "It's such a shame to leave this beautiful weather it has been perfect here in Manila" " fingers crossed we get our next flight or maybe not done" "I'm just so happy oh this is definitely not the last goodbye love you guys" "We are so grateful so grateful we're getting the personal escort through security along with our luggage because the flight's literally supposed to leave like one minute ago [Music] so now we're just headed to Cebu but they couldn't check our bags all the way through we have to pick up our bags when we connect" "We're traveling the world to experience up close and in person all the natural wonders and distinct cultures that our kids would otherwise be consuming only through textbooks and TV" "I think it's actually very safe to travel" "It's safer to travel with our kids around the world than honestly it is where we live" "We could not be more grateful to have made those new friends"
