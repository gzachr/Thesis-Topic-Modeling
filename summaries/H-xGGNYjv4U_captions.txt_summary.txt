"Island Life" is a weekly travel show from the Philippines. This week, the team travel to Siargao, a small island off the coast of the island of Luna. Nyh Nyh's first stop was to get some fruit. The centre was going to be really touristy but it's so local it's the complete opposite it's really cool.
