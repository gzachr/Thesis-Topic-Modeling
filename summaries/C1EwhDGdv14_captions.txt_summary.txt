Quiapo market is a unique market in Manila. There's lots of street food there. The first street food we're gonna try is, they have a number of different noodle-looking dishes. Anton: "This is a market where you can come to really get a feel of the real Manila" "It really feels like you're in the heart of Manila here. The action, every, there's so many things for sale" Filipino food is known for sauces. Lots of vinegar, lots of sauce, so you can add with onions, with chili, yeah. You just choose as many as you want on a stick and then you add the sauce. Anton and Mark go to Quiapo market in Manila, Philippines. They eat chicken balls, dried squid, quail eggs, chili and kwek-kwek. Balut is a duck egg which is partly fertilized, it's an embryo. Balut is the most famous, or maybe the most infamous, Filipino street food. Basketball is the favorite sport in the Philippines. Anton: Balut is like the ultimate hard-boiled duck egg that you could possibly have. Balut tastes almost like it's whipped a little bit, Anton says. Anton: Balut is something, if you're up for an adventure, you gotta try balut, and yeah, I think it's pretty delicious. We have come to the end of this Filipino street food tour, in Quiapo, Manila.
