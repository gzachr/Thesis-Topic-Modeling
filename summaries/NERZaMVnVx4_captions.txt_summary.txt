In this video, Frank goes over 8 popular games that feature various parts of the Philippines either as a vital part of its plot, or as a background for aesthetic reasons. The first real-life Philippine location on this list takes place in the popular wartime shooter game, Medal of Honor: Warfighter in Isabela City, Basilan. The real life Palawan is considered to be one of the most beautiful places in the world. You get to swim the clear blue water, see the inside of a volcano, and visit a Palawan temple. Katamari Damacy features a Filipino House in the Philippines. In Tekken 7, another Philippine stage called “Jungle Outpost” gives us a look into the outskirts of the jungle areas instead of the city. Front Mission 3 is another video game that features 2 Filipino characters, Jose Estrada and Pham Luis. Crysis 3 also features some squatter areas similar to the real-life poorer areas of the Philippines. These video games don’t do justice to the real-life beauty that the Philippines has to offer. It is nice to experience the motherland in the comfort of your own room, especially if you live in another country. These video games really made me miss the Philippines, now if you’ll excuse me, I’m off to grab my passport and search up some flights to Manila.
