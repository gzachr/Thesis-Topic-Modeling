Like the like the outfits that they were wearing in a teaser, yeah He popped up with the The inflatable man when he caught rocky waving inflatable arm-flailing tube-man go Jhope. The video is 3D animated of all the BTS members but it obviously Jimin is in the middle of it. The message is that you can't stop me loving myself, which is a nice message to have. I feel like I had that message like, you know, call me an artist. Call me an idol. I don't care Imma, do me I love myself kind of ish But this just makes me more even more curious about the other songs that are coming out with this repackage Album the music video itself. Geez so much to take in.
