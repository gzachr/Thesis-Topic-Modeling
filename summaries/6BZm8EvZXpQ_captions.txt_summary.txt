A barber cuts a man's hair that he's grown for 8 months. The man's friend translated for him, but it was too hard to explain the style with his bad language skills. In the end, Kimchi man ignores his friend's opinion and cuts his hair more. Vic visited a barber shop in Cebu to get a haircut. The barber washed his hair gently. Vic was impressed with the quality of the haircut.
