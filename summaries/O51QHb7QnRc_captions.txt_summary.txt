Journey has a new singer and he is amazing. He's Filipino and of course, Filipinos are known for being able to sing. He had a really difficult start in life. His mother really really got him into music. The Filipino language has lots of open vowels so it really, really helps. The accent also helps in the placement of singing. It's just so hard to fill Steve Perry's shoes and I found someone he completely smashed it. Arnel: "I'd say you sang really, really well thank you" "Oh jeez, I mean to me that's just like perfection. from like, wow"
